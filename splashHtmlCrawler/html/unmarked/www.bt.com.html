    	<p>To set up BT TV you’ll need these three things: a BT TV box, a BT Hub (with working broadband) and a rooftop aerial. If you already have a Hub and a TV aerial, then we’ll post you a TV box along with any essential equipment and you can set this up by yourself. If you would prefer an engineer to come out and set things up for you then you can arrange that when you’re in the process of buying BT TV.</p>

<b>BT Mobile Extras</b></span></p>
<p><span class="notes"><b>Extra Speed</b></span></p>
<p><span class="notes">With Extra Speed, the maximum speed available through the network is capped at 60 Mbps rather than 30 Mbps on our standard 4G. The speeds you get on your phone will be lower, and depend on things like the number of users, distance from the mast and the type of 4G phone you have. This add on is valid from the moment you buy it and then runs on a 30 day rolling contract. Extra Speed is not available on BT Business Mobile plans.</span></p>
<p><span class="notes"><b>Data and minute add-ons</b></span></p>
<p><span class="notes">These add-ons run on a 30 day rolling contract until you cancel them. When you first buy an Add-On, it lasts until the date of your next BT Mobile bill. It covers minutes or data used over your inclusive plan allowance, up to the allowance for that Add-On, from your last BT Mobile bill until your next one. Add-On allowances reset at the start of each billing month. You can only have one data and one minutes Add-On at any one time</span></p>
<p><span class="notes">A UK Add-On covers minutes or data used over your inclusive plan allowance, up to the allowance for that Add-On, from your last BT Mobile bill until your next one. (So if you buy a 500MB Add-On 10 days before the date of your next bill, it'll cover the data you use for those days and the previous 20). The add-on renews automatically every month on the date you get your BT Mobile bill, unless you cancel it.</span></p>
<p><span class="notes">If you don't want your UK Add-On to renew automatically, you'll need to contact us to cancel it before the date of your next BT Mobile bill. (You can still carry on using it until the date of your next bill and we won't charge you again). Any unused allowance won't carry over when your billing month ends. And if you go over your allowance, standard charges will apply. You can have a maximum of one for minutes and one for data at any one time. We won't transfer or refund UK Add-Ons. They're for your personal use and subject to BT Mobile Service terms and conditions.</span></p>
