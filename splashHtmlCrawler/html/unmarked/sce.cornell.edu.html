<p><strong>Taught by <a href="/travel/online/faculty#129">David Silbey
</a><br>
October 26, 3:00 p.m. ET.</strong></p>
	
<p>Afghanistan was America’s longest war, stretching over nearly twenty years from 2001 to 2020. It started with the white hot fury of 9/11, continued through the death of Osama Bin Laden, and went on as America mostly forgot why it was there. The war ended badly, with a hurried evacuation as the structures the US had worked to build crumbled almost immediately.</p>
<p>This webinar, taught by David Silbey, will look at the history of the war in Afghanistan and the larger history of a kind of war the United States finds particularly challenging, analyzing what went wrong in the Afghan war and why future wars of the type are like.</p>

<p>David Silbey is the associate director of the Cornell in Washington program and a senior lecturer at Cornell. He teaches courses on defense policy and military history. His latest book, <i>The Other Face of Battle: America’s Forgotten Wars and the Experience of Combat</i> looks at how America struggles in wars other than conventionally to have similar endings.</p>

<p><strong>Taught by <a href="/travel/online/faculty#116">Nancy Green</a><br>
June 22, 3:00 p.m. ET.</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the 19th century, the international style known as Art Nouveau spread across the fields of art, architecture, illustration, and applied art, especially decorative arts. Known as Jugendstil (Germany), Stile Liberty (Italy), and Modern Style (Britain), it was popular between 1890 and 1910. Motifs were often inspired by natural forms, particularly the sinuous curves of plants and flowers, giving objects an organic feel. In this lecture, we will explore Art Nouveau's origins, look at some of the artists who worked in this style, and examine some of its multiple variations in Europe and America, as well as consider why it is still such a popular style today.</p>

<p>Arthur Wesley Dow, accomplished artist, photographer, and writer, also played the role of authoritative art professor.

In 1914 Georgia O’Keeffe, who knew of Dow’s pioneering work, came to Columbia to study with him. She acknowledged that at the time she already had technique for handling oil and watercolor easily, but "Dow gave me something to do with it."</p>

<p><strong>Taught by <a href="/travel/online/faculty#235">Edward Baptist</a><br>
March 4, 3:00 p.m. EST</strong></p>
<p>In 2020, a new wave of protests against the police killings of unarmed African Americans rocked the United States and forced many Americans to consider again the charge that unequal justice shapes the experiences of different groups differently. But how deep do patterns of racialized policing run? And how long is the history of resistance to that policing? By looking at the stories embedded in “runaway slave” ads from the new database <a href="https://freedomonthemove.org/">Freedom On the Move</a>, Cornell history professor Ed Baptist will draw a map of the lengthy history of both racialized policing—and the response to it—in the United States.</p>

Taught by <a href="/travel/online/faculty#541">David Lodge</a></p>

<p><strong>A Long Movement: Why the Trumpian Revolution Began in 1954</strong><br>
Taught by <a href="/travel/online/faculty#435">Sidney Tarrow</a></p>

<p>In 1964, Barry Goldwater lost the presidential election to Lyndon Johnson. At the time, most observers thought it was a "one-off." Fifty-two years later, Donald Trump won the election. That, too, was judged a "one-off." In this lecture, Sid Tarrow asserts that neither of these claims are true, but rather both Goldwater and Trump are part of a "long movement," one that began in 1954.<br>

<p>Drew Harvell's research uses <a href="http://www.eeb.cornell.edu/harvellcom/blaschka-marine-invertebrates/">Cornell's Blaschka collection of glass invertebrates</a> as a time capsule to find and film the living matches of these specimens in today's oceans on SCUBA dives from the North Atlantic to the Pacific to Coral Triangle. Join Drew as she talks about amazing wonders of ocean biodiversity and her team's current research on ocean health.<br>

<p><strong>Smuggling in Southeast Asia: The Past in the Present</strong><br>
Taught by <a href="/travel/online/faculty#115">Eric Tagliacozzo</a></p>	

<p>Southeast Asia is a crossroads for trade routes that pass between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, historically and in our own time. These pathways (both legal and illegal) transect the region, funneling cargoes of all sorts—among them, drugs, weapons, and human beings—across a wide geography. This talk looks at the histories of these circuits and asks how these histories still manifest themselves in the commerce of Southeast Asia today.<br>

<p><strong>There's No Place Like Home: Cornell's Residential Landscapes</strong><br>  
Taught by <a href="/travel/online/faculty#295">Roberta Moudry</a></p> 

<p>Cornell's longstanding ambivalence about on-campus housing and the logistics of a coeducational population resulted in two dormitory landscapes situated to the north and west of central campus. As armchair tourists, we'll survey student housing, considering the ways in which institutional attitudes, social norms, and architectural fashion shaped dormitory buildings and landscapes from 1868 to those now under construction on North Campus.<br>

Taught by <a href="/travel/online/faculty#569">Charles Greene</a></p> 

<p>The Earth is an ocean planet. During the next three decades, we must reverse climate change while simultaneously finding sustainable sources of clean energy and food for a global population approaching 10 billion people.
