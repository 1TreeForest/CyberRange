<p>s addressing the fallout from his comments about Oprah Winfrey&#39;s interview with Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.</p>
<p>In a column for the Daily Mail on Saturday, Morgan provided a timeline leading up to his storming off the set of &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; and his eventual departure from the show. Then on Monday, in another Daily Mail column, he attacked CBS for parting ways with Osborne after she came to his defense on &quot;The Talk.&quot;</p>
<p>3rd witness, who told Chauvin to stop kneeling on Floyd, testifies<br />
Donald Williams, the professional mixed martial arts fighter who can be heard in a witness video criticizing Minneapolis police officers during their encounter with Floyd, was called by the prosecution as its third witness Monday.</p>
<p>Williams was walking around the corner from the Cup Foods when he heard a commotion and saw Floyd on the ground with Chauvin kneeling over him, he testified.</p>
<p>Floyd &quot;was speaking in a distressed way&quot; when Williams got there, vocalizing to the officers that he was in pain and that he wanted his mom, Williams said.</p>
<p>&quot;His breathing was getting tremendously heavy,&quot; Williams said, adding that it was apparent that he was struggling to gasp for air.</p>

<p>At one point, Floyd&#39;s eyes then &quot;slowly rolled to the back of his head&quot; and his nose started bleeding, and soon after he was &quot;lifeless,&quot; Williams said.</p>
<p>Williams said his experience as a fighter led him to believe that Chauvin&#39;s position on Floyd&#39;s neck was putting Floyd in imminent danger.</p>
<p>Another witness on the scene who is a paramedic told the officers multiple times to check Floyd&#39;s pulse, but no one did, Williams said.</p>

Defense tries to establish that 911 dispatcher was not an expert on use of force policies<br />
During a cross-examination, defense attorney Eric Nelson walked 911 dispatcher Jena Scurry through the timeline of the encounter and pressed her on her knowledge of Minneapolis Police use of force policies.</p>
<p>Nelson seemed to want the jury to know that Scurry was not familiar with how police handled such incidents.</p>
<p>Scurry acknowledged that she has only seen police incidents play out live on monitors in the dispatch center three to four times in the seven years she has been a dispatcher.</p>
<p>ABC News&rsquo; Whitney Lloyd contributed to this report.</p>
<p><br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t going to apologize for disbelieving Meghan Markle because the truth is that I don&#39;t believe Meghan Markle. And in a free, democratic society, I should be allowed not to believe someone, and to say that I don&#39;t believe them. That, surely, is the very essence of freedom of speech?&quot; Morgan wrote.</p>
<p>Morgan said at the time he was &ldquo;sickened&rdquo; by Meghan and Harry&rsquo;s interview and called it a &ldquo;trash-a-thon&rdquo; of the monarchy. He criticized the couple for dropping a &ldquo;race bombshell&rdquo; regarding an alleged conversation in which a family member questioned how &ldquo;dark&rdquo; their children&#39;s skin would be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word she says, Meghan Markle,&rdquo; Morgan said. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t believe it if she read me a weather report, and the fact that she fired up this onslaught against our royal family I think is contemptible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The United Kingdom&rsquo;s Office of Communications said this month that it was investigating the show&rsquo;s episode under its &ldquo;harm and offense rules&rdquo; after receiving more than 41,000 complaints following the broadcast of Morgan&#39;s remarks.</p>
<p>In his Sunday column, Morgan defended himself and Osbourne, who left CBS&#39; daytime talk show &quot;The Talk&quot; on Friday following remarks she made supporting him.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m not a racist and neither is Sharon Osbourne but that didn&#39;t stop the woke mob lynching her just for defending me,&quot; Morgan wrote in the headline.</p>
<p>Morgan said he believes they were both entitled to their opinions &quot;without being deemed a racist&quot; and called CBS the &quot;Cowardly Broadcasting System&quot; that &quot;pathetically bowed to the woke mob illiberally baying for blood like a bunch of crazed language-policing fascists.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The fact we&#39;ve both lost our jobs is not just an appalling attack on free speech, but it&#39;s also a terrible indictment of woke cancel culture bulls--- and the stinking hypocrisy that lies at the heart of it.&quot;</p>

CBS has not publicly addressed Morgan&#39;s column, but the company said in a statement Friday announcing Osbourne&#39;s departure: &quot;As part of our review, we concluded that Sharon&rsquo;s behavior toward her co-hosts during the March 10 episode did not align with our values for a respectful workplace.&quot;</p>
<p>On an episode of &quot;The Talk&quot; earlier this month, after Morgan&#39;s departure from &quot;Good Morning Britain,&quot; Osbourne expressed her support for his remarks about Meghan and said she shouldn&#39;t be criticized for standing by her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel even like I&rsquo;m about to be put in the electric chair because I have a friend who many people think is a racist so that makes me a racist,&rdquo; Osbourne said.</p>
<p>Co-host Sheryl Underwood, who is Black, asked Osbourne, &quot;What would you say to people who may feel that while you&#39;re standing by your friend, it appears you gave validation or safe haven to something that he has uttered that is racist, even if you don&#39;t agree?&quot;</p>
<p>Osbourne responded, &quot;You tell me where you have heard him say ... educate me, tell me when you have heard me say racist things! Educate me, tell me!&quot;</p>
<p>After the heated exchange with Underwood, Osbourne tweeted an explanation.</p>
<p>&quot;Please hear me when I say I do not condone racism, misogyny or bullying,&quot; she said. &quot;I should have been more specific about that in my tweet. I will always support freedom of speech, but now I see how I unintentionally didn&#39;t make that clear distinction.&quot;</p>
<p>CBS said in its statement, &quot;Going forward, we are identifying plans to enhance the producing staff and producing procedures to better serve the hosts, the production and, ultimately, our viewers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That the evidence has been collected broadly and expansive. Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension employed nearly 50 case agents, analysts and technicians to investigate this case. The Federal Bureau of Investigation included at least 20 additional agents in their investigation.&quot;</p>
<p>The culture of his native Tunisia long informed the designer, and dresses are spun in a &nbsp;precise jacquard, the patterns borrowed from an image from the artists&rsquo; enclave of Sidi Bou Said, where Azzedine Ala&iuml;a had a home. Arab-Andalusian art and architecture was one of his constant sources of fascination, and resulted in the Vienne motif, a series of circles and triangles mimicking the intricate geometry of decorative walls and columns. It can be seen today in laser-cut perforations tracing a bag or in meticulously wrought knits where skin becomes the canvas for delicate openwork.<br />
Revisiting a much-loved signature involves looking at it from a different angle. &ldquo;We took what we think is interesting and important and reinterpreted it into new yarns and new details,&rdquo; says Serrano.</p>
