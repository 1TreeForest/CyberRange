			<p><b><i>Europe Bans Russian State-Backed Channels Russia Today, Sputnik<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/category/articles/page/3/<br>
			</p>
			<p>In an unprecedented move, the European Union has blocked Russian state-backed channels so &quot;they will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin&rsquo;s war and to sow division in our union.&quot;</p>
			<p>In response to Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, the European Union on Sunday took the unprecedented move of banning Russian state-backed television channels Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Russia Today and Sputnik, as well as their subsidiaries, will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin&rsquo;s war and to sow division in our union,&rdquo; said European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. &ldquo;So we are developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Von der Leyen said the move was part of a broader plan to ban &ldquo;Kremlin&rsquo;s media machine&rdquo; from Europe. &ldquo;We are developing tools to ban the toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>RT and Sputnik are widely seen as mouthpieces of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government. Broadcasting in multiple languages, the channels have been accused of spreading misinformation and pro-Russian propaganda. On Saturday, Foxtel suspended the broadcast of RT in Australia. In the U.K., RT is under review by media regulator Ofcom.</p>
			<p>Europe has ratcheted up its sanctions against Russia in the wake of the country&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine on Thursday. The European Commission on Saturday said they would join the U.S., Britain, Canada and Japan in banning some Russian banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system, essentially barring them from international transactions. The 27 nations in the European Union have also shut their airspace to Russian airlines. &ldquo;We are shutting down the EU airspace for Russians,&rdquo; von der Leyen said. &ldquo;We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the EU.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The moves follow a threat by Putin on Sunday that was putting his country&rsquo;s nuclear forces on high alert. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday he had agreed to send a Ukrainian delegation to meet with Russian negotiators to discuss, &ldquo;without preconditions,&rdquo; an end to the war.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I do not really believe in the outcome of this meeting, but let them try so that later not a single citizen of Ukraine has any doubt that I, as President, tried to stop the war, when there was even a small, but still a chance,&rdquo; Zelenskiy said, via his official Telegram channel.</p>
			<p>Zelenskiy said the meeting would take place at the Belarusian-Ukrainian border<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacenews.com/china-launches-national-record-22-satellites-on-long-march-8-commercial-rideshare/<br>
			</p>
			<p>HELSINKI &#151; China&rsquo;s second Long March 8 rocket launched late Saturday carrying a domestic record 22 satellites for a range of commercial Chinese space companies.</p>
			<p>The Long March 8 lifted off from Wenchang Satellite Launch Center at 10:06 p.m. Eastern Feb. 26, with the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) later confirming launch success.</p>
			<p>The second Long March 8 flew without the pair of side boosters used in the rocket&rsquo;s first mission back in December 2020. It has a length of 50.3 meters long and a mass at takeoff of 356 tons.</p>
			<p>The Long March 8 has been slated for test development of vertical takeoff, vertical landing, during which side boosters would remain attached to the first stage. Saturday&rsquo;s mission was expendable, launching over the sea from Hainan island.</p>
			<p>The Long March 8 combines the 3.35-meter-diameter new-generation Long March 7 kerosene-liquid oxygen first stage with a 3-meter-diameter hydrolox second stage from the older Long March 3A series. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;To put it simply, we have hammered out a &lsquo;carpooling&rsquo; solution to launch many small satellites in one successful launch mission,&rdquo; Xiao Yun, chief commander of the Long March 8 rocket program, told CCTV.</p>
			<p>The China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC), a subsidiary of CASC, launched the first &ldquo;Long March Express&rdquo; rideshare using a Long March 6 in April 2021. A number of contracts for the new rideshare were signed at the Zhuhai Airshow in late September. </p>
			<p>The payloads on the Long March 8 involved seven manufacturers with end users including seven commercial companies and two research institutes.</p>
			<p>Changguang Satellite Technology, a Changchun-based remote sensing constellation operator and spinoff from the Chinese Academy of Sciences&rsquo; CIOMP, launched 10 new Jilin-1 satellites for its constellation of remote sensing satellites of the same name.</p>
			<p>These were the Jilin-1 GF03D10-18 satellites, with GF standing for &ldquo;Gaofen&rdquo; or high resolution, with each of the eight satellites having a mass of around 43 kilograms. Jilin-1 MF02A01 is a 32-kilogram multi-functional satellite to test a new platform. A number of the satellites also carry secondary names through sponsorships.</p>
			<p>Small satellite maker Minospace manufactured five satellites aboard the mission. Two of these were the Taijing-3 (01) 240-kilogram optical and Taijing-4 (01) 250-kilogram synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites which will be operated by Minospace.</p>
			<p>The firm also made the Wenchang-1 (01) and (02) wide-field multispectral satellites for the Sanya Institute of Remote Sensing and Hainan Westar Remote Sensing Technology Application Service respectively, each with a mass of 62.5 kilograms. The Xidian-1 hyperspectral remote sensing satellite is for the new Silk Road Tiantu constellation and operated by Shaanxi Silk Road Tiantu Satellite Technology.</p>
			<p>Changsha-based commercial spacecraft maker and constellation operator Spacety launched the Chaohu-1 satellite, the first of the planned Tianxian SAR constellation in cooperation with the China Electronics Technology Group (CETC). The 325-kilogram satellite builds on the Hisea-1 SAR satellite launched on the previous Long March 8 flight.</p>
			<p>Spacety also had the 14-kilogram Thor Smart Satellite on the mission. The satellite carries a distributed software protocol test payloads and three GRID gamma ray burst detectors and the Aurora-2 X-ray polarimeter. </p>
			<p>Tianqi-19 was manufactured by Shandong Institute of Aerospace Electronics Technology for Guodian Gaoke and its Tianqi low-Earth orbit narrow-band Internet of Things constellation.</p>
			<p>The roughly 60-kilogram Hainan-1 (01) and (02) satellites were developed by Shenzhen Aerospace Dongfanghong Satellite, ultimately under the ownership of CASC, for Hainan Westar Remote Sensing Technology Application Service. The satellites carry imagers and automatic identification system (AIS) receivers for maritime surveillance. </p>
			<p>Star Era-17 (Xingshidai-17), also referred to as &ldquo;Dayun&rdquo;, the Chinese name for the Universiade international sports event to be held this year in Chengdu, is a 20-kilogram satellite carrying visible light and thermal infrared imagers and &ldquo;AI payloads&rdquo; developed and operated by ADA Space, based in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, southwest China. The firm raised $55.6 million in Series B round late last year for its AI satellite constellation plans.</p>
			<p>Finally, the Phospherus-1 22-kilogram optical satellite was developed by Wuhan University for hyperspectral imaging.</p>
			<p>Earlier on Saturday China launched the L-SAR 01B satellite on a Long March 4C, sending the synthetic aperture radar satellite to operate in formation with the L-SAR 01A satellite launched in January.</p>
			<p>The hypergolic rocket lifted off from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center at 6:44 p.m. Eastern Feb. 26, CASC confirmed.</p>
			<p>The launches were China&rsquo;s third and fourth orbital missions of 2022 and the first following an extended break for the Lunar New Year celebrations. </p>
			<p>Main space contractor CASC is planning to launch more than 50 times this year, with a number of commercial companies also planning to launch a range of liquid and solid rockets.</p>
			<p>China set a new domestic record of 55 launches in 2021, far surpassing the previous record of 39 launches conducted by China in 2018 and 2020.<br>

						</i></b><br>
					From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Russia_halts_space_launches_from_French_Guiana_over_sanctions_999.html<br>
				</p>
				<p>Russia is suspending space launches from French Guiana and withdrawing its technical personnel in response to EU sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, the space agency said Saturday.</p>
				<p>&quot;In response to EU sanctions against our enterprises, Roskosmos is suspending cooperation with European partners over organising space launches from the Kourou cosmodrome and withdrawing its technical personnel... from French Guiana,&quot; Dmitry Rogozin, chief of the Russian space agency, said on messaging app Telegram.</p>
				<p>There are currently 87 Russian nationals in French Guiana, the agency said.</p>
				<p>The next Soyuz launch from Kourou was scheduled for 6 April.</p>
				<p>An agreement between the European Space Agency and Russia on the use of launchers was signed in 2005. It enabled the Russian Soyuz launchers to use Europe's spaceport in French Guiana as a launch base.</p>
				<p>Soyuz lifted off for the first time from the spaceport in French Guiana in 2011.</p>
				<p>On Thursday, Russian leader Vladimir Putin unleashed a full-scale invasion of pro-Western Ukraine that has killed dozens of people, forced more than 50,000 to flee Ukraine in just 48 hours and sparked fears of a greater conflict in Europe.</p>
				<p>The assault has prompted a wave of new Western sanctions against Russia including an export ban that targets the defence and aerospace sectors.<br>

			<p><b><i>Malaysia&rsquo;s PDRM warns against illegal streaming <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/02/25/malaysias-pdrm-warns-against-illegal-streaming/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Malaysia&rsquo;s federal police force Polis Diraja Malaysia (PDRM) and pay-TV operator Astro have initiated an awareness programme to advise commercial enterprises not to use devices that stream illegal content at their premises. The programme involved officials from PDRM and Astro visiting several such businesses in Subang Jaya on February 24th 2022.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The Copyright (Amendment) Act 2022, which has been published in the Gazette on 10 February 2022, has resulted in several amendments to the Copyright Act, 1987 that are aimed at enforcing laws against the infringement of copyright through streaming technology,&rdquo; advised Subang Jaya OCPD Asst Comm Abd Khalid Othman. &ldquo;The programme conducted today by the Police and Astro&rsquo;s Security Department, involved visiting several business premises that have been identified for using illegal streaming devices. We aim to raise awareness among business premises that showing unauthorised content of Pay-TV service providers such as Astro and other broadcasters illegally is an offence.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We advise businesses to stop using illicit streaming devices and ensure that they obtain the proper subscription and only use legal entertainment services at their premises because illegal streaming is an offence under Section 41(1) Copyright Act and if convicted, could be liable to a fine up to RM200,000 [&euro;43,000] or to imprisonment for a term up to 20 years or to both,&rdquo; he warned.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Piracy is causing a huge loss to the Malaysian economy and putting thousands of jobs at risk,&rdquo; added Kevin Ng, Head of Enterprise Business, Astro Malaysia Holdings. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going to win the war against piracy, stakeholders including government, regulators, broadcasters, right holders, content providers, as well as commercial enterprises, need to present a united front and strategy to protect the value of legitimate entertainment content.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Piracy deeply hurts broadcasters&rsquo; ability to keep serving sports fans. Astro has been working closely with authorities and content partners in combating piracy and have successfully charged illicit streaming device sellers in Malaysia, but more needs to be done.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We welcome the support from PDRM, KPDNHEP, PRESMA in combatting piracy, and we look forward to more cooperation with them to raise awareness amongst commercial outlets and PRESMA members of the repercussions of using ISDs,&rdquo; he concluded.<br>

			</p>

			<p>WASHINGTON &#151; Globalstar has selected MDA Ltd. and Rocket Lab to supply a set of satellites to replenish its constellation, funded by a mystery customer.</p>
			<p>Globalstar said Feb. 24 it awarded a contract valued at $327 million to MDA to build 17 satellites intended to extend the life of the company&rsquo;s existing satellite constellation, which provides messaging and internet-of-things services. The contract includes an option for up to nine additional satellites at $11.4 million each.</p>
			<p>MDA, in turn, awarded a $143 million contract to Rocket Lab to provide the satellite buses. That contract includes options for additional satellites as well as satellite dispensers and launch integration.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The combination of these vendors offered us the best overall balance of innovation, technical capability, schedule reliability and cost,&rdquo; David Kagan, chief executive of Globalstar, said in a statement. &ldquo;We look forward to beginning the process of bending metal and readying the new satellites for launch beginning in approximately three years.&rdquo; Globalstar will contract for the launch of those satellites separately, with the expectation all will be launched by the end of 2025.</p>
			<p>In its statement, Globalstar referred to a &ldquo;potential customer&rdquo; as a key reason to procure the new satellites. &ldquo;Globalstar is acquiring the satellites to provide continuous satellite services to the potential customer under the Terms Agreement described in the Company&rsquo;s Annual Reports, as well as services to Globalstar&rsquo;s current and future customers,&rdquo; the company said.</p>
			<p>That unnamed customer will reimburse 95% of the capital expenditures associated with the new satellites as well as interest costs for Globalstar&rsquo;s financing of the system. Globalstar said it expects to have financing in place for the satellites by August and has deferred initial payments to MDA at 0% interest until Aug. 16.</p>
			<p>In its 2020 annual report, Globalstar said it entered into an agreement, called the Terms Agreement, in February 2020 with an unnamed potential customer. Under that agreement, that customer would pay for nonrecurring engineering services &ldquo;in connection with the assessment of a potential service utilizing certain of our assets and capacity,&rdquo; and work on terms for development of operation of that service. The report doesn&rsquo;t elaborate on the service in question or identify the customer.</p>
			<p>Globalstar released its fourth quarter and full year earnings after the markets closed Feb. 24. The company reported revenue of $124.3 million for 2021, down 3% from 2020, and a net loss of $112.6 million, nearly 3% greater than 2020. Globalstar did not disclose new information about the identity of the potential customer mentioned in the Terms Agreement, but said that customer had provided $111.4 million in advance payments &ldquo;to be recognized into revenue as we perform under the contract.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Much of the industry speculation regarding Globalstar&rsquo;s mystery customer has focused on Apple. There were reports last fall that the latest version of Apple&rsquo;s iPhone would include a satellite connectivity option, with Globalstar providing that service. However, Apple made no mention of a satellite service when it announced the iPhone 13 line in September 2021.</p>
			<p>Globalstar is also facing competition in providing satellite connectivity to smartphones. Lynk is working on a smallsat constellation to provide services, starting with messaging, to conventional smartphones, having recently tested that capability in the United States and several other countries. AST SpaceMobile is developing its own satellite constellation to provide services to mobile phones, raising $462 million in a SPAC merger last April to fund work on that system.</p>
			<p>MDA said in a statement it will assemble and test the Globalstar satellites in a new facility in Montreal. &ldquo;Combining our deep expertise with new partners like Rocket Lab to bring exciting capability to the rapidly growing LEO constellation market further strengthens our position in the global satellite systems market,&rdquo; Mike Greenley, chief executive of MDA, said in a statement.</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab, which will manufacture the buses, will leverage its growing vertical integration by using solar panels, structures, reaction wheels and software from companies it has acquired in the last two years.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacenews.com/spacelink-adds-smaller-satellites-to-roadmap/<br>
			</p>
			<p>SpaceLink awarded OHB System AG a contract valued at more than $300 million to manufacture four satellites for its commercial space data relay constellation. Credit: SpaceLink</p>
			<p>SAN FRANCISCO &#150; SpaceLink announced plans Feb. 24 to establish an initial constellation of smaller satellites than previously planned, a move designed to slash the cost and speed up the rollout of initial data-relay services.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re inserting a set of smaller satellites into our constellation roadmap,&rdquo; SpaceLink CEO Dave Bettinger told SpaceNews. &ldquo;That will allow us to maintain the full capability of what we were launching before but with less capacity.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>SpaceLink plans to spend $240 million to establish its initial constellation, compared with $750 million under its previous plan. The new plan also means the startup will begin offering service in early 2024 as opposed to mid-2024 as originally planned, according to a Feb. 24 news release from SpaceLink parent company Australia&rsquo;s Electro Optic Systems Holdings.</p>
			<p>Under the terms of its FCC license, SpaceLink, must begin providing satellite communications service with satellites in medium Earth orbit by June 2024. With the large satellites the McLean, Virginia-based startup ordered from OHB Systems AG, there was some risk of missing the deadline.</p>
			<p>Under the new plan, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re more comfortable that we&rsquo;ll make our FCC date,&rdquo; said Tony Colucci, SpaceLink chief strategy and commercial officer.</p>
			<p>SpaceLink has not announced the manufacturer for its smaller satellites but has narrowed the choice to two vendors. Contracts for the satellites, which will be roughly half the size of the firm&rsquo;s ultimate constellation of 1,000-kilogram spacecraft, are scheduled to be awarded in April, according to the news release.</p>
			<p>In spite of the change in its initial constellation, SpaceLink remains focused on its goal of establishing a constellation in medium Earth orbit to relay data to and from spacecraft in low Earth orbit. Every two to three years, SpaceLink plans to expand capacity with new generations of satellites, Colucci said.</p>
			<p>SpaceLink continues to work with OHB in an extended engineering phase to incorporate changes in the larger SpaceLink satellites, which like the initial constellation will feature both optical and RF communications links.</p>
			<p>SpaceLink executives anticipate strong demand for communications services from an array of potential customers including commercial Earth observation satellite constellations.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are coming in at a good time because these business models have been proven and now the companies are searching for other ways to get their data to the ground,&rdquo; Bettinger said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be showing up exactly at the right time.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>In addition, commercial human spaceflight missions are becoming more frequent. Those flights will need ongoing connectivity to operate safely, Bettinger added.</p>
			<p>When SpaceLink parent company, EOS, acquired Silicon Valley startup Audacy in 2020, the Australian firm gained approximately 21 GHz of valuable radio frequency spectrum. &ldquo;Given increasing congestion and demand for advanced satellite services, it is imperative to satisfy the FCC milestone date and preserve the access to the wide bandwidth conferred by the spectrum rights,&rdquo; the news release said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;With this contract Rocket Lab is executing on its strategy to go beyond launch and lead the new space economy by delivering complete mission solutions spanning spacecraft manufacture, satellite subsystems, flight software, ground operations and launch,&rdquo; Peter Beck, chief executive of Rocket Lab, said in a company statement.<br>

			<p><b><i>Fifty more Starlink satellites ready for launch Friday<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://spaceflightnow.com/2022/02/24/fifty-more-starlink-satellites-ready-for-launch-friday/<br>
			</p>
			<p>SpaceX will launch another 50 Starlink internet satellites Friday from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, continuing what&rsquo;s expected to be a cadence of nearly one Falcon 9 launch per month this year at the West Coast spaceport.</p>
			<p>Officials said last year that SpaceX would start launching some of its Starlink missions from California, potentially at a pace of one Falcon 9 flight per month. And that cadence has materialized since November, following a dearth of SpaceX missions from Vandenberg since the start of 2019.</p>
			<p>SpaceX plans to launch a Falcon 9 rocket Friday from Space Launch Complex 4-East at Vandenberg with the company&rsquo;s next cluster of 50 Starlink internet satellites. There are two instantaneous launch opportunities available at 9:12 a.m. PST (12:12 p.m. EST; 1712 GMT) and at 11:10 a.m. PST (2:10 p.m. EST; 1910 GMT).</p>
			<p>The mission will mark the 150th flight of a Falcon 1, Falcon 9, or Falcon Heavy rocket since SpaceX debuted its launcher family in 2006. It will be the 21st SpaceX launch from Vandenberg, a military spaceport located on California&rsquo;s rugged Central Coast between Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>
			<p>The launch will also be the second this week to carry Starlink satellites into orbit, following the liftoff of a Falcon 9 rocket Monday from Cape Canaveral with 46 of the privately-built broadband relay stations. Friday&rsquo;s mission will be SpaceX&rsquo;s 38th launch dedicated to deploying Starlink internet satellites.</p>
			<p>SpaceX has launched 2,137 Starlink internet satellites to date, some of which have failed or been decommissioned. That makes SpaceX the owner of the world&rsquo;s largest fleet of satellites,.</p>
			<p>Each Starlink spacecraft weighs about a quarter-ton, and is fitted with communications antennas, a solar panel, laser inter-satellite links, and krypton-fueled ion thrusters for orbital maneuvers.</p>
			<p>The Starlink network will number roughly 4,400 satellites when SpaceX is done building out the first phase of the network, spread among five different orbital &ldquo;shells&rdquo; at different altitudes and inclinations. SpaceX, founded and led by Elon Musk, has signaled it eventually intends to launch as many as 42,000 satellites.</p>
			<p>The network beams high-speed, low-latency internet signals around the world, reaching consumers, underserved communities, and other potential users like the U.S. military.</p>
			<p>The satellites launching Friday will head for an orbital shell at an altitude of 335 miles (540 kilometers) and an inclination of 53.2 degrees to the equator. The orbital parameters will require the Falcon 9 to perform an in-flight steering maneuver, or &ldquo;dog-leg&rdquo; to avoid flying over populated areas in the first few minutes of the flight.</p>
			<p>The Falcon 9&rsquo;s trajectory will hug the coast of California and Baja California as it heads southeast from Vandenberg over the Pacific Ocean.</p>
			<p>SpaceX&rsquo;s drone ship &ldquo;Of Course I Still Love You&rdquo; is positioned in the Pacific about 400 miles (650 kilometers) downrange from Vandenberg. The Falcon 9 rocket&rsquo;s first stage will shut down and separate from the upper stage about two-and-a-half minutes into the mission, then begin a descent back into the atmosphere, targeting a vertical landing on the floating platform less than nine minutes after liftoff.</p>
			<p>The reusable booster stage flying Friday is numbered B1063 in SpaceX&rsquo;s fleet, and is making its fourth trip to space, following previous launches with the Sentinel 6 Michael Freilich oceanography satellite, a Starlink mission, and NASA&rsquo;s Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, mission.</p>
			<p>The Falcon 9&rsquo;s upper stage will fire two times to place the 50 Starlink satellites into orbit Friday. The first burn will put the payloads into a transfer, or parking, orbit, then a second maneuver will circularize the orbit at an average altitude of about 193 miles (311 kilometers).</p>
			<p>The satellites will be released from the Falcon 9 rocket nearly 63 minutes into the mission, then begin post-launch checkouts, deploy their solar arrays, and begin climbing to their operational altitude.<br>

			<p><b><i>Discovery passes 22m streaming subs on back of discovery+ growth<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2022/02/24/discovery-passes-22m-streaming-subs-on-back-of-discovery-growth/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Discovery has said it had 22 million paying streaming subscribers at the end of last year, including recently launched direct-to-consumer offering discovery+, up from around 20 million for the prior quarter.</p>
			<p>CEO David Zaslav said that the strong streaming subs growth provided &ldquo;a tailwind&rdquo; for revenue growth of 11%. However, even advertising growth reached 10%, despite the challenges facing the ad market.</p>
			<p>Zaslav said that Discovery now expects its merger with WarnerMedia to close in the second quarter following approval by the European Commission and a green light from US tax officials for the proposed structure of the deal.</p>
			<p>Discovery posted Q4 revenues of US$3.2 billion, up 10% or 11% excluding currency movements.</p>
			<p>In the US, distribution revenues grew by 17%, outperforming advertising revenue growth of 5%, while internationally the placing was reversed, with advertising growth of 12% exceeding distribution revenue growth of 5%.</p>
			<p>Discovery+ was the main driver of streaming growth, the company said. The service also helped deliver the increase in distribution revenue, offsetting a decline in linear subscribers. Distribution revenue was also boosted by increases in affiliate rates.</p>
			<p>Linear subscribers dropped by 5% over the course of the year excluding the impact of the sale of the group&rsquo;s Great American Country network.</p>
			<p>Discovery has also moved forward with plans to deliver an &ldquo;ad-lite&rdquo; offering in key markets on the back of moving its European  streaming subs base to the same technology platform as the US. The lower-cost ad-lite version of the service will debut in the UK in March, providing access to unscripted content but not to premium sports.</p>
			<p>The factual content giant posted OIBDA of US$1.14 billion for the fourth quarter and OIBDA of US$3.82 billion for the full year.</p>
			<p>Zaslav said that 2021 had been &ldquo;by all measures an exceptional year for our company&rdquo; that had delivered close to US$4 billion in cash and generated &ldquo;robust&rdquo; cash flows, which would support &ldquo;our ability to invest in growth initiatives&rdquo;.<br>

			<p><b><i>Price rise for Sky Sport this year 'more likely than not'<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/127871921/price-rise-for-sky-sport-this-year-more-likely-than-not<br>
			</p>
			<p>Sky TV is no longer in defensive mode, chief executive Sophie Moloney says.</p>
			<p>It is more likely than not Sky Television will increase the price of Sky Sports from about the middle of the year, chief executive Sophie Moloney says.</p>
			<p>But Moloney said Sky could also consider making Spark Sport available as an app on the new set-top box it plans to launch around then, without taking a cut of Spark&rsquo;s revenues from the service.</p>
			<p>That could make it easier for sports fans to get all their sports content, including domestic cricket, from one device, she said.</p>
			<p>Sky mulled an increase in the price of Sky Sport, which currently costs $31.99 a month, last year.</p>
			<p>But Moloney said it had not increased the price of the service since 2019.</p>
			<p>She indicated the service was getting more valuable, as a result of Sky winning back the right to broadcast EPL matches from August.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Rights inflation&rdquo;, for example the increased costs of its rugby rights, was also a factor, she said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;A sports package increase is something that we are having a look at.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>It was fair to say a price rise was more likely than not, but Sky needed to have a conversation with its customers first, she said.</p>
			<p>Making Spark Sport available as a paid app on Sky&rsquo;s new set-top box looked like a &ldquo;great opportunity&rdquo;, Moloney said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The nature of that deal and how it works would obviously be subject to discussions direct with Spark.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Sky TV chief executive Sophie Moloney says Sky Sport price rise &lsquo;more likely than not&rsquo;.</p>
			<p>It was not necessarily the case that Sky would want to clip the ticket, she indicated.<br>
				&ldquo;If it can be structured so that there is an opportunity for new revenue growth, we're always keen on that.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;[But] ultimately, what we want to do is make it really easy for New Zealanders to have the best of their content opportunities delivered in one place, so that is the main focus,&rdquo; she said.</p>
			<p>Moloney made the comments after announcing what she described as a solid financial result for the company in the six months to the end of December.</p>
			<p>Sky Television will resume paying dividends to shareholders this year after managing to grow its pay-TV revenues over the same period in 2020.</p>
			<p>Its profit for the first half of its financial year fell 29 per cent to $28 million, but the company reaffirmed its upgraded profit guidance for the full year.</p>
			<p>The company indicated it could return some of the $55m cash-gain it expects to achieve in March through the sale of its Mt Wellington headquarter properties, through a capital return to shareholders.</p>
			<p>But Sky said it was also &ldquo;actively investigating investment opportunities to accelerate business growth&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Moloney would not go into specifics on those opportunities, including on speculation they might involve a tie-up with media firm NZME.<br>
				Sky says it is on track to get its new set-top box into homes by the middle of this year.</p>
			<p>Sky&rsquo;s revenues for the half-year rose by 4.1 per cent to $372m after a protracted period of decline, with its customer numbers growing 6 per cent to 983,561 due to growth in its streamed offerings.</p>
			<p>But the number of Sky Box customers &#150; those who receive its service via satellite &#150; fell by about 10,000 to 545,002 over the six-month period, which was similar to the drop it experienced in the first six months of 2021.</p>
			<p>The company is banking on the release of a new set-top box mid this year that will support 4K viewing and streaming apps, and that will come with a remote control able to accept voice commands, to arrest that trend.</p>
			<p>But Moloney indicated Sky still expected to end the calendar year with fewer Sky Box customers than the 545,002 it had at the start of the year.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, Sky as a business was no longer in &ldquo;defence mode&rdquo;, she said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We now have a greater understanding of our existing and prospective customer base, an enhanced portfolio of rights and a balance sheet which is able to embrace opportunity and growth, as well as to recommence distributing dividends to our investors.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Moloney said Sky had offered &ldquo;a valued and crucial service&rdquo; during the Covid lockdowns.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We saw a continuation in the positive trend of increased customer numbers, even with the reduced ability to complete Sky Box installations during the lockdowns.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Annualised churn in Sky Box customers has continued to reduce to a new low of 9.1 per cent and there is a growing trend of customers entering into longer term subscriptions to Neon,&rdquo; she said.</p>
			<p>Sky shares were trading down 3.7 per cent at $2.59 in lunchtime trading.<br>

			<p><b><i>Rocket Lab officially opens third launch pad, Next launch within a week<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Rocket_Lab_officially_opens_third_launch_pad_Next_launch_within_a_week_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1  </p>
			<p>Rocket Lab USA, Inc (Nasdaq: RKLB) has announced the completion of its second orbital launch pad at Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand - the Company's third dedicated pad for its Electron rocket - and confirmed the new pad's first mission will be a dedicated commercial launch scheduled to lift-off within a week's time.</p>
			<p>Pad B is based within Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1, the world's first private orbital launch site, located in Mahia, New Zealand. The new pad is Rocket Lab's third for the Company's Electron launch vehicle and joins the existing Pad A at Launch Complex 1 and a third launch pad at Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 in Virginia, USA. With two operational pads within the same launch complex, Rocket Lab doubles the launch capacity of its Electron launch vehicle.</p>
			<p>Launch Complex 1 Pad B will support the upcoming launch of a dedicated Electron mission for Japanese Earth-imaging company Synspective. Lift-off is currently scheduled for no earlier than February 28 UTC / March 1 NZT.</p>
			<p>With two launch pads and private range assets at Launch Complex 1, concurrent launch campaigns are now possible from the site. This enables resilient access to space by accommodating tailored customer requirements or late changes to a spacecraft while keeping Rocket Lab's manifest on schedule. Operating two pads also eliminates pad recycle time, ensuring a launch pad is always available for a rapid-response mission. Launching from a private launch complex, Rocket Lab is also able to avoid the lofty range fees and overheads typically associated with shared launch sites, resulting in a cost-effective launch service for satellite operators.</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Peter Beck, says: &quot;A reliable launch vehicle is only one part of the puzzle to unlocking space access - operating multiple launch sites so we can launch when and where our customers need to is another crucial factor. We are proud to be delivering responsive space access for our customers, making back-to-back missions possible within hours or days, not weeks or months.</p>
			<p>&quot;Even with just one pad at Launch Complex 1, Electron quickly became the second most-frequently launched U.S. rocket every year. Now, with two pads at Launch Complex 1 and a third in Virginia, imagine what three pads across two continents can do for schedule control, flexibility, and rapid response for satellite operators globally.&quot;</p>
			<p>More than 50 local construction workers and contractors were involved in the development of Launch Complex 1 Pad B, which includes a 66-ton launch platform and 7.6-ton strongback customized to the Electron launch vehicle. With Pad B operational, several roles are available now at Launch Complex 1 to support Rocket Lab's increased launch cadence.</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab's Vice President - Launch, Shaun D'Mello, says: &quot;With Pad B we've kept things efficient. Its systems and layout replicates Pad A and shares much of Pad A's infrastructure including the Electron vehicle integration hangar, runway to the pad, and our own range control facility. With that we've been able to double our operational capacity - all on a concrete area smaller than the average tennis court. I'm hugely proud of what the team has achieved: building and bringing a second pad online, all while continuing to service and operate Pad A for our Electron launches to date, and in the middle of a global pandemic no less.&quot;</p>
			<p>Launch Complex 1</p>
			<p> Located on the Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand, Launch Complex 1 is the world's first and only private orbital launch site. As the launch site for Rocket Lab's Electron rocket, Launch Complex 1 has supported the successful delivery of more than 100 satellites to space across a range of missions for environmental and marine monitoring, Earth observation, science and research, internet connectivity, technology research and development, and national security.</p>
			<p>An FAA-licensed spaceport, Launch Complex 1 is capable of supporting up to 120 launch opportunities every year. From the site it is possible to reach orbital inclinations from sun-synchronous through to 30 degrees, enabling a wide spectrum of inclinations to service the majority of the satellite industry's missions to low Earth orbit.</p>
			<p>Located within Launch Complex 1 are Rocket Lab's private range control facilities, three satellite cleanrooms, a launch vehicle assembly hangar which can process multiple Electrons for launch at once, and administrative offices. Operating a private orbital launch site alongside its own range and mission control centres allows Rocket Lab to reduce the overhead costs per mission, resulting in a cost-effective launch service for satellite operators.<br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/02/23/oneweb-russia-launch-stays-on-schedule/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Despite the threat of further trade sanctions against Russia, OneWeb is expecting to see 36 of its satellites launched on March 4th from Russia&rsquo;s Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.</p>
			<p>The launch is contracted to Arianespace but uses a Russian-built Soyuz 2.1b rocket which is handled by Russia&rsquo;s Federal Space Agency Roscosmos.</p>
			<p>The launch, number 14 for OneWeb, will see the satellites placed into low Earth orbit at an initial height of 450 kms prior to being raised to their target orbits of 1200 kms.</p>
			<p>The launch will also be the 64th Soyuz mission handled by Arianespace.</p>
			<p>The extra 36 craft will take the total OneWeb fleet launched to 454 out of a planned total of 648 satellites. 600 are needed for a full constellation with 48 as ground spares.<br>

			</p>
			<p>South Africa&rsquo;s pay-TV and streaming broadcaster, DStv, is clamping down on password sharing. A note to subscribers on the company&rsquo;s website says that password sharing and piracy are challenges for streaming providers globally.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;As part of our ongoing efforts to counteract password sharing and piracy, while continuing to bring you the best viewing experience, we will be introducing measures to limit concurrent streaming. From 22 March 2022, customers will be limited to streaming DStv on one device at a time. They will still be able to watch previously downloaded content on a second device. The change will made to all DStv subscriptions across Africa, however, only customers making use of more than one concurrent stream will be directly affected by the change,&rdquo; says DStv.</p>
			<p>DStv adds there will be no change to pricing.</p>
			<p>The news has not gone down well with customers. As the rule now stands, it will not be possible for a main TV to be used simultaneously with a second set, perhaps in a child&rsquo;s bedroom.<br>

			<p><b><i>Data: 7.5m Australians BVoD users <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/02/22/data-7-5m-australians-bvod-users/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Findings from research firm Roy Morgan indicate 7.5 million Australians now watch Broadcast Video on Demand (BVoD) services which include ABC iView, SBS On Demand, 7plus, 9Now and 10 Play.</p>
			<p>Viewership of BVoD services grew strongly during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020 with an increase of around 2.1 million viewers (+39.5 per cent) in 2020 compared to the December quarter 2019. This level of growth was always going to be hard to maintain and over the last year an additional 130,000 viewers streamed BVoD services, an increase of 1.8 per cent on 2020, for a total of over 7.5 million viewers (35.5 per cent).</p>
			<p>Notably, all five leading services have grown compared to two years ago pre-pandemic, however ABC iView and SBS On Demand grew strongly during 2020 but lost viewers during 2021. In comparison, 7plus, 9Now and 10Play have all substantially increased their viewership during each of the past two years.</p>
			<p>ABC iView continues to be the clear market leader with 4.13 million viewers in an average four weeks, up a large 985,000 (+31.3 per cent) from two years ago, although down 633,000 (-13.3 per cent) on a year ago.</p>
			<p>SBS On Demand remains in second place and is now viewed by 2.86 million Australians representing an increase of 217,000 (+8.2 per cent) from two years ago although down 653,000 (-18.6 per cent) from a year ago.</p>
			<p>The leader of the three traditional commercial broadcasters is the Seven Network&rsquo;s 7plus which is now viewed by 2.6 million Australians, an increase of 727,000 (+38.8 per cent) from a year ago.</p>
			<p>Close behind are the Nine Entertainment Company&rsquo;s 9Now which is viewed by 2.38 million Australians, up 318,000 (+15.4 per cent) on a year ago and Network 10&rsquo;s 10 Play now viewed by 1.7 million Australians, up 358,000 (+26.7 per cent).</p>
			<p>Roy Morgan CEO Michele Levine says viewership of &lsquo;Video on Demand&rsquo; services offered by Free-to-Air broadcasters such as ABC iView, SBS On Demand, 7plus, 9Now and 10 Play boomed during 2020 as Australia experienced a nation-wide lockdown, however this growth levelled off in 2021:</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Over 7.5 million Australians are now watching at least one of the Video on Demand services offered by the ABC, SBS and the leading commercial channels 7, 9 &amp; 10 &#150; growth of over 2.2 million (+42 per cent) on 2019,&rdquo; she notes. &ldquo;However, there was only a marginal increase in viewership of 130,000 (+1.8 per cent) on a year ago.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;All five services experienced large growth in viewership during 2020 when the entire country was plunged into a nation-wide lockdown in the early stages of the pandemic. However, the across-the-board growth hasn&rsquo;t been sustained in 2021, although the traditional commercial broadcasters have notched up a second straight year of growth.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The most impressive growth has been for 7Plus which has increased its viewership by 1,259,000 (+93.8 per cent) from two years ago pre-COVID and is up 532,000 (+39.7 per cent) from a year ago to over 2.6 million. 7Plus is now the most watched Video on Demand service from any of the traditional commercial broadcasters.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The other traditional commercial broadcasters have also experienced rapid growth with viewership of 9Now up 985,000 (+70.5 per cent) from two years ago to 2,383,000 and viewership for 10 Play up 634,000 (+59.5 per cent) from two years ago to 1,698,000.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;However, despite the strong growth for 7Plus, 9Now and 10 Play all three still trail ABC iView and SBS On Demand. ABC iView is the clear market leader with a total viewership of over 4.1 million, an increase of 985,000 (+31.3 per cent) on two years ago, while SBS On Demand has increased its viewership 217,000 (+8.2 per cent) to 2,860,000 &#150; to be just ahead of 7 Plus.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In contrast to the traditional commercial broadcasters, viewership of ABC iView and SBS On Demand has not maintained the growth seen during the early stages of the pandemic and was down by the end of 2021 compared with a year earlier.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The trends seen for the free Video on Demand services offered by Australia&rsquo;s &lsquo;Free-to-Air&rsquo; broadcasters are similar to those seen for the leading Subscription TV services. The more well-established brands such as Netflix and Stan saw strong growth during the early stages of the pandemic during 2020 but were unable to continue this growth during 2021.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;However, newer services including Foxtel&rsquo;s Binge &amp; Kayo Sports, as well as newer entrants such as Disney+, have seen consistently strong growth during each of the last two years. These trends are explored in detail in a recent release on Australia&rsquo;s Subscription TV market: Foxtel, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video are the big improvers for Subscription TV during 2021, but Netflix still the largest.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Looking forward, and with a widening array of streaming services for consumers to choose from, the competition between paid services and their free counterparts is only going to increase. The &lsquo;boost&rsquo; provided to viewership by the unprecedented pandemic is unlikely to be repeated and securing growth going forward will depend more heavily on providing exciting and engaging content for viewers,&rdquo; she concuded.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.itnews.com.au/news/australian-carriers-ordered-to-block-more-pirate-streamers-576415<br>
			</p>
			<p>Federal Court backs movie studios.</p>
			<p>Telstra, Optus, Vocus, Vodafone and TPG are among internet providers to be been ordered to block 34 pirate sites under a Federal Court judgment.</p>
			<p>Movie studios brought the case in November 2021, following a similar case in September last year that led to an order to block another 100 domains.</p>
			<p>In the latest judgment, Justice John Nicholas gave the telcos  - a total of 48 respondents, including various subsidiaries of Telstra, Optus, Vocus, Vodafone and TPG - 15 days to &ldquo;take reasonable steps to disable access to the target online locations&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Most carriers didn&rsquo;t contest the application, made on behalf of Disney, Paramount Pictures, Columbia Pictures, Universal, Warner Bros or Netflix.</p>
			<p>Justice Nicholas said the ad-supported sites had &ldquo;large catalogues of infringing material&rdquo;, and that they &ldquo;infringe copyright flagrantly and their operators display a disregard for copyright general&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>The order lets the carriers choose between blocking DNS addresses, IP addresses, or URLs.</p>
			<p>The case was brought under Section 115a of the Copyright Act, first enacted in 2015. </p>
			<p>The judgment noted that &ldquo;none of the operators provided any substantive reply to the solicitors&rsquo; communications&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;None of the operators of the target online locations applied to be joined as a party to the proceeding and none sought to appear at the hearing&rdquo;, the judgment states.</p>
			<p>The infringing sites were frequently registered in multiple top-level domains.</p>
			<p>For example, the lawsuit showed &ldquo;7movierulz&rdquo;, which appeared to offer pirated Bollywood content, as having domains in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (.vc), Latvia (.lv), Palau (pw), Madagascar (mg), the British Virgin Islands (.vg), Mexico (.mx) and and Peru (.pe).</p>
			<p>iTnews contacted the major carriers for comment.</p>
			<p>A Telstra spokesperson told iTnews: &ldquo;We will abide by the Federal Court ruling and will act accordingly.&rdquo; TPG, which owns many ISP brands as well as Vodafone, said likewise.</p>
			<p>An Optus spokesperson said: &quot;Optus blocks websites if the Australian Federal Court has determined infringe or facilitate the infringement of copyright, as per section 115A of the Copyright Act.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacenews.com/u-s-and-international-partners-to-share-launch-cost-of-new-communications-satellite/<br>
			</p>
			<p>WGS partner nations include Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Norway. The U.S. also has a separate agreement with Australia.</p>
			<p>WASHINGTON &#151; U.S. officials are in talks with international users of the Wideband Global Satcom (WGS) communications satellites about a cost-sharing agreement to fund the launch of the new WGS-11+. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;The Department of the Air Force and the U.S. Space Force conducted exploratory discussions with current WGS partners and two new partners to meet the costs associated with launch and ground integration of WGS 11+ throughout its acquisition strategy development,&rdquo; Keith Anderson, business and financial manager for military satcom international partners, told SpaceNews Feb. 22 in a statement. </p>
			<p>Anderson&rsquo;s office is under the U.S. Space Systems Command, in Los Angeles. The command is buying WGS-11+, currently being developed by Boeing and projected to launch in 2024. It is the 11th satellite of the WGS constellation.</p>
			<p>WGS satellites provide broadband communications to the U.S. military and allies.</p>
			<p>The Pentagon never intended to buy WGS-11+ but Congress directed it. The Air Force&rsquo;s budget request in 2018 did not include any funding for WGS satellites beyond the 10 already ordered from Boeing, leading Congress to add $600 million for two new satellites. </p>
			<p>The Air Force said the funding was only enough for one satellite but it would have significantly more capacity. It awarded Boeing a $605 million contract in April 2019 to design and build WGS-11+. </p>
			<p>The congressional add-on did not include money to launch the satellite &#151; which could cost $150 million &#151; so the Space Force is seeking contributions from international partners that use the WGS satellites. </p>
			<p>WGS partner nations include Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Norway. The U.S. also has a separate bilateral agreement with Australia. Anderson said Australia is not a signatory on the multilateral WGS 11+ agreement, which pays for launch costs, but is still a partner in the overall WGS program.</p>
			<p>Two new partner nations are in discussions to join the coalition but their identities have not yet been disclosed.</p>
			<p>Partners in the past have contributed funding for ground integration of WGS satellites and other services to ensure access to the constellation. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;At this time, all currently signed partners have committed to providing additional funding to the WGS program, subject to the successful conclusion of an international agreement,&rdquo; said Anderson.</p>
			<p>The $600 million appropriated by Congress &ldquo;allowed Space Systems Command to procure a robust satellite vehicle, roughly doubling the capacity of the earlier WGS-10,&rdquo; Anderson said. &ldquo;There was enthusiastic interest from international partners to collaborate on WGS 11+, allowing partners to provide additional funding for the program, including some launch costs.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The launch will be procured through the U.S. Space Force&rsquo;s National Security Space Launch program.<br>

			</p>
			<p>SpaceX successfully launched 46 of the company's own Starlink broadband Internet communications satellites from Florida on Monday.</p>
			<p>The mission, Starlink 4-8, was the first since the company lost about 40 of the Starlink satellites on Feb. 4 during a solar storm that thickened the air and caused the satellites to burn up as they crashed back through the atmosphere.</p>
			<p>The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off as planned at 9:44 a.m. EST into a sunny, blue sky from Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station near Kennedy Space Center.</p>
			<p>SpaceX canceled a previous attempt planned on Sunday due to weather concerns that could have had an impact on the recovery of the rocket's first stage booster on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
			<p>The company recovered that booster successfully after Monday's launch on the robotic barge, A Shortfall of Gravitas.</p>
			<p>The booster previously was used to launch astronauts on the Demo-2 mission to the International Space Station in May 2020, as well as five earlier Starlink missions, a cargo mission to the space station and three other satellite missions.<br>

			<p><b><i>DVB Native IP spec approved <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/02/21/dvb-native-ip-spec-approved/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The DVB-NIP specification has been approved by DVB&rsquo;s Steering Board, bridging the gap between broadband and broadcast networks and paving the way for a converged media distribution solution.</p>
			<p>DVB-NIP is the result of one year of technical work by representatives of more than 13 DVB Member companies from across the media delivery value chain. The new system, designed to use DVB-S2X or DVB-T2 broadcast bearers, is entirely IP-based and no longer relies on the MPEG-2 Transport Stream that has been the basis for DVB broadcast systems up to now.</p>
			<p>The rationale behind DVB-NIP is to use the efficiency of broadcast networks for large-scale content distribution to modern IP devices, fully integrating broadcast technologies with those used in broadband networks. Operators can use the same broadcast signal to cover both professional applications (CDN caches, content distribution to tower sites, hotspots, etc.) and consumer applications (DTH to native-IPTV sets, broadcasting to IP devices via in-home gateway functionality).</p>
			<p>For the operators of DVB platforms and services, a transition to native-IP delivery can bring both cost savings and new revenues. The primary source of cost savings is the ability to use a single unified OTT headend to target all end devices. Unification is also possible in IP-based client devices, digital rights management solutions and content formats. New revenues can stem from reaching a wider pool of devices and selling higher value advertising slots based on targeting and newly available analytics.</p>
			<p>DVB-NIP reuses many existing DVB standards, including those that have been previously defined for broadband IP networks, adapting the latter, where necessary, for use on large-scale broadcast networks.</p>
			<p>The DVB Technical Module working group that developed the specification was led by Tom Christophory (SES) and R&eacute;gis Moulin (Eutelsat). Its work was based on commercial requirements that were developed by the Commercial Module&rsquo;s satellite-focused working group, led by Thomas Wrede (SES).</p>
			<p>The DVB-NIP specification has been published as DVB BlueBook A180 and will be forwarded to ETSI for formal standardisation in due course. Required updates to other specifications are also being publish progressively: DVB-GSE Part 2 and Part 3 are published as DVB BlueBooks A116-2r2 and A116-3r1; and updates to the DVB-S2X, DVB-T2 and DVB-SI specifications will be published shortly.<br>

			<p><b><i>Amazon and Reliance to make plays for domestic IPL rights<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2022/02/21/amazon-and-reliance-to-make-plays-for-domestic-ipl-rights/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Amazon and Reliance Industries are considering making big plays for domestic rights to cricket&rsquo;s lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL).</p>
			<p>The IPL is one of the most-watched sports competitions in the world. The 2020 edition of the IPL, broadcast by Disney-owned Star India, was watched for 383 billion minutes while the opening match alone attracted more than 200 million viewers.</p>
			<p>Hotstar is facing increasing competition in the IPL&rsquo;s upcoming tender, with Reuters reporting that broadcast rights to the two-month series of matches could go for a record INR500 billion (&euro;5.91 billion).</p>
			<p>Star India previously paid INR163.48 billion (&euro;1.93 billion) for the digital and television rights until 2022. The Disney-owned broadcaster, which also streams the competition on Disney+ Hotstar, was already facing competition from Sony for the rights, but the two billionaire-backed players are set to drive up rights.</p>
			<p>The Reuters report, citing sources familiar with the companies&rsquo; plans, notes that Amazon and reliance are both interested in the rights in an effort to boost their sports presence in the country. </p>
			<p>Amazon recently began streaming cricket in India, while Reliance views the IPL as &ldquo;critical&rdquo; to the long-term plans for its video platform Jio. </p>
			<p>While it would want to retain the rights, Disney is confident of maintaining growth in India without the IPL, CEO Bob Chapek recently told investors.<br>

			<p><b><i>Nine Boss Set To Face Tough Questioning After Viewers Desert Stan Platform<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.channelnews.com.au/nine-boss-set-to-face-tough-questioning-after-viewers-desert-stan-platform/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Nine boss Mike Sneesby is set to face some tough questioning this week about his online streaming operation Stan, which according to the latest Roy Morgan viewing data fell by 4 per cent in the final three months of 2021 (year-on-year), while its key rivals &#150; Foxtel, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video enjoyed strong growth in the same quarter of 23.9 per cent, 45.5 per cent and 45.1 per cent respectively.</p>
			<p>Stan has punted on second tier sports including the Foxtel rejected Rugby Australia rights, the three-year deal cost the Nine network $100 million deal with questions now being raised about the &lsquo;real value&rsquo; of the investment to the Nine Network who is facing the potential loss of the rights to the Australian Tennis Open, which despite the Nine network having the rights is not streamed on Stan.</p>
			<p>Since then, they have picked up Six Nations Rugby, in a $1.5m deal over three years; second-tier motorsport competitions, the ARG SpeedSeries, the little-known Formula E, IndyCar and the World Rally Championship, as well as the mixed martial arts Professional Fights League.</p>
			<p>ChannelNews understands that the Seven Network is looking to go after Tennis and could well drop their Cricket Australia deal for the rights to Tennis.</p>
			<p>The Nine network is set to report this week, the second reporting period for Sneesby who the former head of Stan was.</p>
			<p>Ahead of this week&rsquo;s announcements Sneesby has finally announced the appointment via the Australian Financial Review which is owned by Nine Media of Martin Kugeler to run the subscription business permanently.</p>
			<p>Sneesby stood down 12 months ago from running Stan to take on the CEO role at Nine Media, Sneesby has faced repeated questions in the past 12 months about the delay in appointing a permanent replacement.</p>
			<p>The Australian newspaper owned by News Corp who also own the majority of the shares in Foxtel, claim Sneesby will be keen not to repeat the mistake he made last August at his first set of end-of-financial-year results for Nine, when he bullishly announced additional investment in Stan &#150; prompting the company&rsquo;s share price to plummet almost 10 per cent in the minutes after his address.</p>
			<p>The issue that seemed to spook investors last August was Mr Sneesby&rsquo; s statement that Stan would continue to pour more resources into live sports streaming, which some analysts believe is tricky terrain because of the shortage of available broadcast rights for premium sports.<br>
				In August, Mr Sneesby said: &ldquo;Live streaming and sport was always part of the long-term strategy to Stan in being able to diversify content line-up and differentiate that proposition in what we knew would be a very competitive market.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are effectively launching a start-up business this year and investing back into a start-up business that sits on the side of Stan&rsquo;s entertainment business.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;With any start-up business comes investment.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Roy Morgan CEO Michele Levine said streaming platforms had benefited from the pandemic in Australia, with surging subscription numbers coinciding with extended periods of lockdown.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Foxtel now has over 7.1 million viewers, up over 1.3 million (+23.9%) from a year ago and up by almost 1.9 million (+35.6%) from two years ago,&rdquo; she said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The growth for Foxtel has been across all its platforms but has been strongest for the new Binge streaming subscription service, launched in May 2020, and Kayo Sports, launched in November 2018. Both new services have well over 1.5 million viewers already. The big increases in viewers for newer services hasn&rsquo;t been matched by the more established players. Although both Netflix and Stan added a significant number of new viewers in 2020 this momentum was not sustained in 2021.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The results of the last two years, and particularly over the last year, show that as competition intensifies in the subscription TV market, the pressure grows to bring new content to market to provide new reasons for people to sign up, or continue subscribing.&rdquo;<br>

				From https://www.terradaily.com/reports/Musk_donates_satellite_gear_to_reconnect_Tonga_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>Tonga says space entrepreneur and Tesla founder Elon Musk has donated 50 satellite terminals to help the volcano-damaged Pacific island reconnect with the world.</p>
			<p>Tonga's telecommunications system has been severely restricted since January 15 when a violent volcanic eruption and tsunami severed its underwater fibre-optic cable. </p>
			<p>Musk's Space X corporation is providing 50 very-small-aperture terminals (VSAT) &quot;and we are looking at how we can best utilize it,&quot; Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni said Friday. </p>
			<p>The tiny South Pacific kingdom was also considering offers to increase Tonga's internet capacity, which has been operating on a very small bandwidth since the cable was broken. </p>
			<p>&quot;It's something we are testing right now,&quot; he said. </p>
			<p>Technical staff from SpaceX and the Tonga Government were working on installing the equipment to have it operational from next week. </p>
			<p>The volcanic eruption, so powerful it was heard as far away as Alaska and triggered a tsunami that flooded coastlines around the Pacific, shredded an 80-kilometre (50 miles) stretch of Tonga's undersea telecommunications cable.</p>
			<p>Sovaleni said he expected temporary repairs to be completed early next week<br>

			<p><b><i>Roku hits 60m subs <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/02/18/roku-hits-60m-subs/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Roku has reported that it reached 60.1 million active users in the period to December 31st 2021. Streaming usage grew between Q3 and Q4 from 18 billion hours to 19.5 billion hours. However, revenues were below expectations.</p>
			<p>Roku blamed the disappointing revenue numbers on shortages in kit. The company said supply chain issues were continuing and the company saw little improvement during 2022.</p>
			<p>CFO Steve Louden declined to confirm a recent report that Roku is exploring a plan to manufacture its own TVs but described the Roku TV development programme as being &ldquo;very successful&rdquo;, adding that &ldquo;we&rsquo;re very happy with the progress we&rsquo;ve had over the last five years on that programme&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Roku is now forecasting first quarter 2022 revenues of $720 million.</p>
			<p>A report from analysts at Berenberg Bank said that the Q4 performances across most of the SVoD platforms were either weaker on subscriber growth or indicated higher investments going into 2022 &#150; pushing out the profitability timetable.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Roku, while primarily an advertising video on demand (AVoD) platform, reflects a similar trend. On a longer horizon, we believe Roku stands to benefit from the broader shift toward streaming (from linear/broadcast television), an opportunity from the smart TV penetration gap in international markets, and the transfer of advertising dollars to connected TV from linear TV,&rdquo; stated the bank.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;However, the Q4 results continued to demonstrate pressure on revenue growth driven by a) component shortages, b) an inflationary pricing environment for TVs, and c) softer advertising, particularly from auto and consumer packaged goods. The overall gross margin remained under pressure, driven by negative Player margins, as the company continues to absorb additional costs driven by a) component shortages and b) logistical costs,&rdquo; added the bank&rsquo;s report.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The outlook for Q1 came in below Street expectations and the full-year outlook provided during the conference call demonstrated focus on increasing investment levels. The top-line growth outlook for 2022 was softer versus consensus. While increased investments indicate a delay to the margin accretion timetable and demands more patient capital, we believe it also demonstrates confidence in the long-term growth potential,&rdquo; concluded Berenberg.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.bollyinside.com/news/nbn-co-disruption-caused-by-micrometeorite-hitting-satellite<br>
			</p>
			<p>NBN Co&rsquo;s chief development officer for regional and remote Australia, Gavin Williams, told a Senate estimates hearing this week that the most likely cause was a micrometeorite hitting its Sky Muster satellite and causing the machine to rotate in its orbit. &ldquo;It cannot be 100 percent characterized as this, but all the evidence points to a micrometeorite that impacted the satellite,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It effectively makes satellite&rsquo;s body rotate while it remains in its orbit. So the satellite is no longer pointing at the appropriate spot on Earth the payload &#150; the transmission system on that satellite &#150; is effectively switched off for that period.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Sky Muster satellites are two geostationary (GEO) communications satellites built by Maxar-owned SSL and launched in 2015 and 2016 to provide rural connectivity. Weighing around 6.4 tons each, they provide download speeds of up to 25Mbps, and upload speeds of 5Mbps.</p>
			<p>Williams also noted that 573 customers went two weeks without Internet after the incident due to configuration errors in their NBN boxes preventing them from reconnecting to the service.</p>
			<p>A micrometeorite is a micrometeoroid &#150; a small particle of rock in space usually weighing less than a gram &#150; that has survived entry through the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) defines meteorites as 30 micrometers to 1 meter, with micrometeorites the lower ~submillimeter range of the spectrum On the day of the event Sky Muster manager Optus informed NBN it had an &ldquo;off-orbit condition of our second satellite,&rdquo; due to a micrometeorite hitting it. The satellite eventually rotated back around into the correct position, and after testing the service was resumed.<br>

			</p>
			<p>This expansion will see double the live hours of 4K UHD content this year</p>
			<p>Foxtel has announced it will expand the availability of sports in 4K Ultra-High Definition (UHD) and the launch of a new destination for UHD sport.</p>
			<p>This expansion will see double the live hours of 4K UHD content this year for Foxtel viewers, including 200 hours of NRL &#150; including select NSW Cup and NRLW matches, AFL, Formula 1 &#150; including practice and qualifiers and 2022 Masters Tournament.</p>
			<p>As part of the better experiences for sports fans, these enhancements will see the existing single Fox Sports UHD channel on Foxtel, Channel 508, replaced. </p>
			<p>To access the 4K UHD, subscribers will need to go to the Sports section of the home screen or hit the Sport button on their voice remote.</p>
			<p>Nick Dundy, group director of product innovation and UX, Foxtel Group, said: &ldquo;Fox Sports is the home of the best coverage of Australia&rsquo;s most popular sports, and we want our Foxtel Sports subscribers to enjoy an experience like no other.

			<p><b><i>Netflix, Foxtel or Stan: Streaming platforms battle for top position<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://mozo.com.au/broadband/articles/netflix-foxtel-or-stan-streaming-platforms-battle-for-top-position<br>
			</p>
			<p>Netflix, Foxtel, and Stan compete to have the most viewers on their streaming platforms</p>
			<p>While the world tunes into the Winter Olympics, the battle for the podium positions is brewing among the major streaming platforms. With the competition getting tighter every day, the pressure is on for streaming services to offer the best content and hold audiences' attention.</p>
			<p>New data from Roy Morgan shows the state of the field between the top players: which Australian streaming services kept the highest viewership, who attracted the most new viewers and who is slowing down.</p>
			<p>Since streaming numbers overtook free-to-air TV for the first time in January, it has never been clearer that streaming is here to stay. Make sure you&rsquo;re getting the best deal on broadband so you don&rsquo;t miss any of the action.</p>
			<p>Gold: Team Netflix keeps the highest viewership</p>
			<p>Groundbreaking innovator Netflix remains the largest service by a comfortable margin. After years in first place, Netflix can add another year in the top spot to their medal cabinet. They boast a whopping 12.8 million viewers at the end of 2021 - more than 6 million ahead of second place.</p>
			<p>In 2021, Netflix only managed to add a marginal 10 thousand new users. It was enough to hold onto their lead, but could point to a period of stagnation while the competition catches up.</p>
			<p>Silver: Team Foxtel earns a steady second place</p>
			<p>Entertainment giants Foxtel have been in the TV game for a while. But since accepting the inevitable, and pivoting towards streaming, the combined viewers across their streaming platforms tallied a respectable 7.1 million viewers.</p>
			<p>Adding 1.3 million subscribers last year, this was the largest increase across any of the competitors. Foxtel&rsquo;s numbers come from a combination of sports hub Kayo, the legacy platform Foxtel Now and their new flagship service Binge.</p>
			<p>Foxtel will have to set their sights on gold and get on the grind if they hope to dislodge the champion any time soon.</p>
			<p>Bronze: Team Stan - but will they hold off the competition for long?</p>
			<p>Last year saw a bitter struggle for third place, as Stan, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video all jostled for the Bronze Medal.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, Stan was able to hold onto the final podium position, but by only 54 thousand viewers. The platform owned by Nine Entertainment has been slipping in viewership throughout 2021, but just managed to make it over the line in third place with 4.7 million.</p>
			<p>Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video were hot on Stan&rsquo;s heels, seeing big gains throughout the year. With Disney&rsquo;s 4.68 million, and Amazon&rsquo;s 4.3 million, it might take a miracle to hold off the digital titans in 2022.<br>

			<p><b><i>Sky seizes English Premier League rights back from Spark<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/sky-seizes-english-premier-league-rights-back-from-spark/LI65P75XNKJUWKGA7OCCC6R5DQ/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Why Sky's football win matters</p>
			<p>The see-saw battle for the world's most-viewed sporting competition has again tipped toward Sky TV.</p>
			<p>Sky says it has secured rights to the English Premier League for six years from the 2022/23 season - which will begin this August.</p>
			<p>The pay-TV broadcaster says it will show all 380 games per season live and on-demand on its sports channels and Sky Sport Now. Details on build-up shows and half-time panels will be released closer to August.</p>
			<p>Spark - which already faced questions from wealth manager Jarden about its commitment to sport - will now have to lean heavily on its domestic cricket rights.</p>
			<p>End of paying twice?</p>
			<p>The EPL will join Sky's existing football lineup, which includes the Wellington Phoenix and the A-League, FA Cup and Fifa World Cup games.</p>
			<p>&quot;Those of our Sky Sport customers who are fanatical football fans have had to purchase a second service to watch the Premier League in recent years, and it's great to now be able to offer them the Premier League as part of their wide range of sport and entertainment viewing options on Sky,&quot; the company's chief executive Sophie Moloney said.<br>
				Make it your business to know</p>
			<p>Start your day with the latest business headlines straight to your inbox.</p>
			<p>Some English and European football fans will still feel the need to shell out for a Spark Sport sub, however. The telco's streaming service still has rights to Uefa's Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League.</p>
			<p>Deal will have run to tens of millions</p>
			<p>Sky's new EPL deal was on undisclosed terms and negotiated directly with the English Premier League. BeinSport - Sky's partner when it last had EPL rights between 2016 and 2019 - was out of the frame this time.</p>
			<p>Streaming English football first came to NZ in 2013 via PremierLeaguePass, launched in 2013 and bankrolled by rich-lister Peter Cooper. It partnered with Spark toward the end of its three-year rights period before it was outbid by BeinSport, which partnered with Sky, for the 2016-19 cycle.</p>
			<p>A PremierLeaguePass insider estimated Bein paid $10m for 2016 to 2019 rights.</p>
			<p>It's likely the price has headed sharply north since. The Premier League just jacked up its prize money to &pound;176m for the winning 2021/22 team (from &pound;153m last year). The 20th-placed team will still pocket an eye-watering &pound;106m (from &pound;98m).</p>
			<p>The UK Government forced the EPL to roll over its current domestic rights deal amid the pandemic. The league said the increases were fuelled by new overseas rights deals - including US broadcaster NBC, which AP reports tripled its payments to US$2.7b to secure a new six-year deal.</p>
			<p>The Premier League is the most viewed sports league in the world, attracting a global cumulative audience of 3.2 billion viewers, Moloney says.</p>
			<p>In recent years football has grown exponentially in New Zealand, both in terms of participation and it is now the most popular team sport for 5&#150; to 17-year-olds, she adds.</p>
			<p>Spark: 'Disappointed'</p>
			<p>&quot;We are naturally disappointed that we were unsuccessful in renewing the rights for the Premier League,&quot; head of Spark Sport Jeff Latch says.</p>
			<p>&quot;The nature of our business is that we both win and lose content rights as they come to market and over the past few months we have secured a range of rights including extended NFL action, UFC, FIBA, the United Rugby Championship and Diamond League World Athletics.</p>
			<p>&quot;We're proud to be the home of New Zealand Cricket content &#150; Aotearoa's most popular summer sport &#150; and we still have plenty for football fans to sink their teeth into such as the Uefa Champions League, Uefa Europa League, and Uefa Conference league and we've got some exciting announcements coming up in the coming months which we know football fanatics will love.&quot;</p>
			<p>Earlier, Spark chief executive Jolie Hodson said her company was committed to Spark Sport. Her company would pursue new deals - but it was looking for a commercial return.</p>
			<p>Spark caused a stir when it grabbed 2019 Rugby World Cup rights, but Sky struck back by paying a reported $400m for a new five-year deal covering All Blacks and Super Rugby matches through to 2025. The pair split cricket rights as new deals were announced in 2020. And last year, Spark nabbed the Rugby League World Cup but Sky signed a new NRL deal running through to 2027.</p>
			<p>Spark sold its entertainment streaming service Lightbox - launched in 2014 - to Sky in 2019.</p>
			<p>Sky shares closed yesterday at $2.48.</p>
			<p>The stock, which had a 10:1 consolidation in September, is up 38 per cent for the year.<br>

			<p>French satellite operator Eutelsat has experienced a drop in broadcast revenues, leading the company to push back its financial targets.</p>
			<p>The company&rsquo;s shares dropped by 5% in reaction to the news, with the operator expecting revenue to drop to &euro;1.11-1.13 billion for its five key businesses for its fiscal year which ends in June. This is down from previously forecast revenues of up to &euro;1.15 billion.</p>
			<p>Eutelsat has also experienced capacity delays on two of its satellites &#150;  KONNECT VHTS and EUTELSAT 10B&#150; and has pushed its forecast for a return to sales growth into 2023/24.</p>
			<p>Eva Berneke CEO of Eutelsat, who took over the role at the beginning of 2022 said: &ldquo;This has been a satisfactory First Half in financial terms, with strong free cash flow generation and a further industry leading EBITDA margin, despite the decline in revenues, testifying to our fundamentally robust business model and stringent financial discipline. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;The First Half has seen a number of important commercial and operational milestones, notably with the entry into service of EUTELSAT QUANTUM, strong progress on our Fixed Broadband roll-out, the cementing of our position in OneWeb and the receipt of the first tranche of our C Band proceeds.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The newly instated CEO also praised the &ldquo;technical expertise, asset quality and long-term commercial traction&rdquo; of the company, and stated confidence in delivering long-term value in spite of the downgraded forecast.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2022/02/15/canal-and-bein-secure-piracy-busting-injunction-to-protect-champions-league-coverage/<br>
			</p>
			<p>French broadcasters Canal+ and beIN Sports France have obtained injunctions to prevent themselves against pirate UEFA Champions League broadcasts.</p>
			<p>The Paris Court of Justice has handed the broadcasters these injunctions to the broadcasters at a time when regulator ARCOM is clamping down on online piracy. </p>
			<p>The orders are described as &ldquo;one of the first of their kind&rdquo;. They are based on the new laws that give ARCOM the power to extend the blocking measures to any websites not yet identified in the order that illegally transmit live content of UEFA Champions League matches, during the current season.</p>
			<p>Caroline Guenneteau, deputy general counsel of beIN Media Group, said: &ldquo;A few weeks after obtaining the very first court decision under the new dedicated French legislation, beIN Sports is continuing its fight against piracy alongside rights holders, official broadcasters and ARCOM. This succession of actions and blocking measures taken by ISPs will quickly significantly reduce access to fraudulent sites, less than two months after the law came into force.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Celine Boyer, head of content protection at Canal+ Group: &ldquo;The Canal+ Group welcomes the court injunction which is a valuable addition to the numerous efforts made by the Group to protect sports right -holders. It is a major step forward in the fight against audiovisual piracy in France and ARCOM is doing a great job.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The move was praised by UEFA, with its marketing director Guy-Laurent Epstein saying: &ldquo;UEFA fully supports the court injunctions issued by the Paris Court of Justice to protect media rights owned by the Canal+ Group and beIN Sports France. The decisions are evidence of the new and flexible approach that has been adopted in France to accelerate the blocking of illegal websites as well as tackling the issue of internet piracy in this country. The protection of our intellectual property and our rights holders is a top priority for our organisation.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>EU backs &euro;6bn satellite system <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/02/16/eu-backs-e6bn-satellite-system/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The European Union (EU) has published an 80-page document which proposes a Public-Private partnership satellite communications system. The scheme is budgeted at &euro;6 billion (&euro;5.2bn) and would give Europe a secure and independent satellite constellation.</p>
			<p>The proposals have two prime objectives:</p>
			<p>1/ to ensure governmental users access to a secure communication system for the protection of critical infrastructures, surveillance and crisis management</p>
			<p>2/ to allow for the provision of commercial services by the private sector.</p>
			<p>The EU document says: &ldquo;There is an unprecedented demand for satellite communication services. Spurred by this technological progress, we see the emergence of various public-supported or subsidised non-EU mega-constellations in the US, China and Russia, among others. At the same time, the geopolitical context, cyber and hybrid threats further prompt security and resilience concerns.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The EU says there is a &ldquo;mismatch&rdquo; and a shortage of available frequency filings and orbital slots due to the dramatic increase of mega-constellations. Absence of timely action at EU level would also endanger the competitiveness of EU industry in key technologies and markets.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This initiative will offer mobile and fixed broadband satellite access, satellite trunking for B2B services, Satellite access for transportation, reinforced networks by satellite and satellite broadband and cloud-based services. It can support edge computing, Internet of Things, autonomous driving, e-health, smart working and education, in-flight and maritime connectivity, and smart agriculture,&rdquo; says the proposal.</p>
			<p>The cash for the proposed system would come from the EU with funding of &euro;2.4 billion. The European Space Agency is expected to kick in another &euro;750 million. The remainder would come from EU member states and the private sector. The EU targets initial service by the end of 2024 and a full service (probably with the LEO layer) by mid-2027.<br>

				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2022/02/15/irdeto-partners-with-tass-for-china-oriented-drm-solution/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Security firm Irdeto has announced a collaboration with Beijing Jiangnan Tianan Technology Co (TASS) to launch a multi-DRM solution including China DRM.</p>
			<p>Irdeto Control On-Premises also includes support for leading commercial DRMs such as Microsoft PlayReady, Google Widevine, Apple FairPlay. The product is the licensed version of Irdeto Control, and will allow Chinese operators to deploy their services in China and worldwide.</p>
			<p>China&rsquo;s digital rights management market is fragmented across device types and platforms, meaning that operators have had to source multiple suppliers to meet their DRM needs. This is an issue which Irdeto Control On-Premises is looking to solve</p>
			<p>Shane McCarthy, COO of Video Entertainment at Irdeto, said: &ldquo;This partnership will result in strong solutions offered to Chinese customers that carry the same technology proven at scale, supporting billions of licences every month. It will enable them to enjoy the complete DRM capability with wide coverage to multiple devices and platforms and extend their service internationally. They&rsquo;ll be able to accelerate revenue by using the same industry-approved technology that is available to global streaming services and other content operation platforms.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Deng Xiaosi, general manager of TASS, said: &ldquo;We are delighted to be a part of this partnership and look forward to helping content owners and aggregators in China further expand their base of loyal subscribers, who want to be able to watch their favourite movies and shows on the device of their choosing, wherever they want, whenever they want.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Kacific's Covid response recognized as Satellite Project of the Year - Kacific<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From http://www.voxy.co.nz/business/5/398710<br>
			</p>
			<p>Auckland 15 February 2022 - Kacific&rsquo;s COVID-19 response has been recognized as the Satellite Project of the Year at the Global Carrier Awards 2021, where it was described as the most ingenious and visionary project in the satellite space.</p>
			<p>When the COVID-19 crisis took the world by surprise, providing medical care and sharing information were crucial to combatting its spread and impact. Yet many rural regions throughout the Pacific had little or no connectivity to their main centers. To bridge this gap, Kacific rapidly initiated a large-scale Community WiFi project to provide rural health clinics with high-quality, low-cost satellite broadband using affordable, easy-to-install antennas. The project drew capacity from Kacific&rsquo;s high throughput satellite, Kacific1, which uses spot beam technology to cover populated areas across 25 nations.</p>
			<p>In partnership with GuarantCo, Kacific secured a grant from the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) Technical Assistance to fund the terminals and help support governments and communities in Asia and the Pacific to fight the pandemic.</p>
			<p>Since then, over 200 terminals have been installed in Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and the Philippines to bring fast affordable broadband to health clinics, schools, and communities around the world. They connect clinics, schools, and facilities for government agencies to curb, monitor, and control the spread of infectious Covid-19 clusters in rural areas, as well as to train local medical practitioners to cope with local virus outbreaks.</p>
			<p>Kacific&rsquo;s service has allowed medical professionals in isolated areas to coordinate with nationwide COVID-19 health responses, arrange emergency evacuations, and communicate with city-based specialists. The connected clinics were enabled to save more lives, especially in critical life-and-death cases. In addition, the internet connections at health clinics doubled as community hubs were used for disaster response communications.</p>
			<p>&quot;Kacific is honored to receive this award,&quot; says CEO, Christian Patouraux. &quot;However, the real heroes and visionaries have been those doctors, nurses, and health workers working in some of the most remote communities in the Pacific, who so quickly discovered how much they could do with connectivity and how it could help them take care of their people and save lives.&quot;</p>
			<p>The project provides free 30GB of data for up to 1,000 rural health posts, clinics, community halls and schools across the Asia Pacific and the initial sites will get three months of free bandwidth. With each terminal comes a &quot;Community WiFi&quot; prepaid data package that allows the local community to connect using voucher codes.<br>

				From https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU2202/S00310/kacific-and-farmer-charlie-team-up-to-grow-agricultural-output-and-support-sustainable-development-across-pacific.htm</p>
			<p> Kacific Broadband Satellites and Farmer Charlie will bring affordable satellite-powered agricultural information and expertise to farmers in remote and isolated places across South East Asia and the Pacific.</p>
			<p>The companies have signed an MoU supporting sustainable development and agriculture in small holdings across the region.</p>
			<p>Kacific and Farmer Charlie will work together to deliver agricultural advice, localised weather information, and agribusiness information &#150; including data from in-field sensors -- to smallholder farmers and agribusinesses, helping them improve land management and food production using smart digital tools. It will also help them reduce post-harvest loss, better manage the risk of drought, floods, and other extreme weather events and address the impacts of climate change.</p>
			<p>The companies share a common vision of helping farming and rural communities achieve meaningful economic, social, and environmental outcomes and impacts in support of the UN&rsquo;s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
			<p>The agreement will extend Farmer Charlie&rsquo;s reach into remote communities in the South East Asian and Pacific region, and enhance Kacific&rsquo;s overall offerings to include Farmer Charlie&rsquo;s expertise and solutions. It will bring fast, affordable broadband directly to the field, where connected weather and in-field sensors, together with other low-cost IoT devices, will be able to deliver agribusiness information at a cost that small holdings and remote communities can afford.</p>
			<p>Farmer Charlie&rsquo;s expertise in the provision of low-cost, smart, localised information and applications to farmers and Kacific&rsquo;s high-speed and reliable satellite broadband will enable farmers to operate more sustainably.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In a world where large scale agribusiness is dominating global good production, reducing biodiversity and adversely affecting smaller communities, this initiative represents a practical way of reversing the trend. It takes a much-needed step towards revitalising local agricultural practices and empowering local farmers,&rdquo; said Christian Patouraux, Kacific&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer. &ldquo;The combination of Famer Charlie's expertise and our connectivity capabilities has tremendous transformational potential for thousands of small communities.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Kacific will provide accessible VSAT terminals that connect to beams drawing bandwidth from its powerful Ka-band satellite, Kacific1. Farmer Charlie will develop targeted systems for rural communities in those markets covered by Kacific, based on the knowledge and expertise it has acquired over the past five years and the solutions it has developed for small and emerging agricultural operations.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This MOU is a huge milestone for Farmer Charlie&rsquo;s deployment in the Asia Pacific region. It is an opportunity to optimize the synergy between Kacific and Farmer Charlie, especially as we both aim to support those remote communities with an affordable solution through the provision of smart localised tailored agribusiness information&rdquo;. said Betty Bonnardel, Farmer Charlie&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer. &ldquo;Together, we will be creating a real impact for the communities we will serve.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Kacific and Farmer Charlie will also work together to develop and implement systems to facilitate disaster recovery and emergency assistance for connected farms and businesses across the region.</p>
			<p>Innovate UK and British High Commission were present at the MOU signing ceremony to support this exciting partnership between Kacific and Farmer Charlie. Dr. Hanbin Zheng, the Head of S&amp;I, British High Commission, said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted to see that UK Science and Innovation Network (Singapore) support for 2022 Innovate UK Space Global Business Innovation Programme (GBIP) to Singapore has resulted in a practical collaboration between Farmer Charlie and Kacific.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This collaboration demonstrates how UK and Singapore technological expertise can be leveraged to positively impact the lives of farming communities in the Pacific islands, and promote sustainability. It also illustrates how space technology and applications can effectively intersect across sectors and geographies to benefit mankind.&rdquo;<br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/02/14/jio-ses-india-broadband-jv/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Jio Platforms (JPL) and SES have formed a multi-year Joint Venture to supply high-performance satellite-based broadband services across India. Jio will be the anchor customer for the new JV, which will extend Jio&rsquo;s network reach and resiliency by leveraging SES&rsquo;s satellites in both geostationary and medium earth orbits, including O3b mPOWER fleet.</p>
			<p>JPL and SES will own 51 per cent and 49 per cent equity stake in the joint venture respectively. The JV will use multi-orbit space networks that is a combination of geostationary (GEO) and medium earth orbit (MEO) satellite constellations capable of delivering multi-gigabit links and capacity to enterprises, mobile backhaul and retail customers across the length and breadth of India and neighbouring regions.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The Joint Venture will be the vehicle for providing SES&rsquo;s satellite data and connectivity services in India, except for certain international aeronautical and maritime customers who may be served by SES,&rdquo; say the pair. &ldquo;It will have availability of up to 100 Gbps capacity from SES and will leverage Jio&rsquo;s premier position and sales reach in India to unlock this market opportunity. As part of investment plan, the joint venture will develop extensive gateway infrastructure in India to provide services within the country. Jio, as an anchor customer of the joint venture, has entered into a multi-year capacity purchase agreement, based on certain milestones along with gateways and equipment purchase with total contract value of circa US $100 million.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The Joint Venture will leverage SES-12, SES&rsquo;s high-throughput GEO satellite serving India, and O3b mPOWER, SES&rsquo;s next-generation MEO constellation, to extend and complement Jio&rsquo;s terrestrial network, increasing access to digital services and applications. Jio will offer managed services and gateway infrastructure operations services to the joint venture.<br>

				FCC to revise satellite rules <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/02/15/fcc-to-revise-satellite-rules/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The FCC is to make major changes to how it registers the licensing of satellites.</p>
			<p>The plans come from bipartisan proposals, currently in draft form, from the US House Energy and Commerce Committee and the release of a pair of Bills which should improve how the FCC handles the registration of new satellite proposals.</p>
			<p>The proposals are contained within the Satellite and Telecommunications Streamlining Act and Secure Space Act, which will likely gain cross-party support, and cover foreign ownership rules, licensing itself and how satellite spectrum is handled and shared.</p>
			<p>The Bills proposers say: &ldquo;We must streamline our regulatory processes to usher in a new era of American innovation and investment in this growing sector, particularly as our economic competitors like China race to dominate this industry, and must ensure our laws and regulations fully protect the public.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel welcomed the draft legislation, commenting: &ldquo;While the FCC staff has done tremendous work in reviewing applications and simultaneously updating our rules from orbital debris to commercial space launch communications, the truth is that the laws were written to address a different satellite ecosystem.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>EU to take on SpaceX and Amazon with its own satellite internet system<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.ft.com/content/329d7c77-b4fe-4753-910b-60a4a29eb436<br>
			</p>
			<p>Brussels wants standalone coverage but internal watchdog has previously raised doubts over proposals</p>
			<p>The EU is to launch plans for a multibillion-euro satellite internet system to compete with the likes of Amazon and SpaceX despite previous objections from its internal watchdog.</p>
			<p>Brussels&rsquo; initiative to provide encrypted broadband coverage will be unveiled on Tuesday in amended form after proposals were twice rejected by the European Commission&rsquo;s Regulatory Scrutiny Board. The board &#151; which vets impact assessments for proposals put forward by the commission &#151; believed the scheme would waste money and compete with commercial services, according to EU officials.</p>
			<p>The Secured Communications initiative has been put forward by Thierry Breton, the internal market commissioner, who wants the EU to build a third satellite system in lower earth orbit (LEO) for secured communications and access to the internet. The EU already has Galileo, a global navigation system, and Copernicus, which is used for earth observation.</p>
			<p>The signal from the new system would be encrypted and offered to Europe and Africa to give that continent an alternative to Chinese-built infrastructure. It would also provide a back-up in case of cyber attacks.</p>
			<p>Breton told French TV channel BFM on Monday that the EU needed a sovereign system with encryption that governments and companies could use.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It is indispensable that Europe has its own constellation and not depend on the Americans and Chinese,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It will run north-south and secure our communications in case of cyber attack. It has a military and sovereign dimension. We can offer connectivity to the continent of Africa.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The commission&rsquo;s scrutiny board rejected the impact assessment for the project twice, according to two people familiar with the situation, on the basis that other options had not been fully considered. This in effect ruled out cheaper options such as renting space on a commercial provider&rsquo;s network or using an earth-based system.</p>
			<p>Some amendments were made following the rejections with a commitment to involve small companies in the design and building of the system to boost the EU&rsquo;s space industry. Businesses will be asked to provide &euro;2bn of the initial investment in a public/private partnership.</p>
			<p>It is rare for a project to be rebuffed twice from the commission&rsquo;s own watchdog and a scheme would usually be blocked unless Maros Sefcovic, vice-president of the commission for interinstitutional relations, agreed to take it forward. The commission declined to comment on internal procedures.</p>
			<p>One EU diplomat said although several member states had reservations they believed the plan would receive approval.</p>
			<p>The commission contracted companies including Airbus, SES and Eutelsat to carry out a technical study for the project. The running costs are significant, with LEO satellites needing replacement roughly every five to seven years.</p>
			<p>The EU conceived the idea after the UK bought a stake in OneWeb, the satellite operator, in 2020. Last year Eutelsat, in which the French government has a stake, invested in OneWeb, causing Breton to question whether Eutelsat could take part in the EU project.</p>
			<p>SpaceX, owned by Tesla founder Elon Musk, has launched close to 2,000 satellites under the Starlink name and has applied for licences to fly more than 40,000.</p>
			<p>Amazon&rsquo;s Project Kuiper will comprise more than 3,000 satellites.</p>
			<p>The EU intends to offer services to consumers in remote places without broadband. But Starlink heavily subsidises the hardware needed to receive it, charging $499 against a cost at least four times that. Broadband costs $99 a month in the US, around double the price of fibre. <br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2022/02/14/streaming-success-for-discovery-in-beijing/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Viewership of Discovery&rsquo;s coverage of the ongoing Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics has already surpassed the 2018 games within one week.</p>
			<p>Like with the 2020 Tokyo games, Discovery has used Beijing to increase engagement on discovery+ along with Eurosport digital services. The company has also highlighted strong overall linear viewership of the games across Europe. </p>
			<p>Discovery said that eight times more viewers are streaming Olympic content compared to the same period for Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018. Total new paid subscribers to Discovery&rsquo;s streaming services has already surpassed 2018 with a week of competition still to go.</p>
			<p>The company added that nearly three-quarters of a billion streaming minutes have been consumed on Discovery&rsquo;s subscription services so far. This is more than 18 times higher than the same period of PyeongChang 2018. Average minutes consumed per viewer across discovery+ and Eurosport streaming services has more than doubled, with viewers on average watching 29% longer on television vs PyeongChang 2018. </p>
			<p>Jean-Briac Perrette, president and CEO, Discovery Streaming &amp; International, said: &ldquo;The Olympics are off to a strong start across all our platforms, with discovery+ at the forefront of this early success as the growth of our streaming service continues to significantly outperform.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It is also reaffirming the power and value of integrating sports into our discovery+ entertainment service. As well as attracting a significant number of new discovery+ subscribers, sports broadens its appeal throughout the whole household and provides consumers an even greater, more retentive value proposition. Through just this first week, more than a third of new discovery+ Olympics subscribers have already consumed other entertainment content on the platform.&rdquo;</p>
			<p> Andrew Georgiou, president of Sports, Discovery, said: &ldquo;The audience and engagement growth we have experienced during the opening stage of the Games really demonstrates the additional value Discovery brings to its audiences and partners. Through our network of free-to-air, Eurosport, discovery+ and free digital and social platforms, we are driving more people to our Olympic content for longer.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>ITV Studios, Samsung TV Plus channel partnership<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/02/14/itv-studios-samsung-tv-plus-channel-partnership/<br>
			</p>
			<p>ITV Studios is partnering with connected TV platform Samsung TV Plus for the first time to launch two brand new channels in Europe.</p>
			<p>The new FAST channels, free ad-supported streaming TV, with associated AVoD, include the following:</p>
			<p>&bull;Storylands &#150; a brand new channel set to become the home for the best European drama, produced by labels which are part of ITV Studios. This includes dramas such as the critically-acclaimed Norwegian legal series Aber Bergen; period drama Un Village Fran&ccedil;ais and the intriguing procedural crime drama from the producers of Gomorrah, called Masantonio.<br>
				&bull;A dedicated Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen channel, which will feature round-the-clock episodes of the hit US version of the Gordon Ramsay show</p>
			<p>They will initially kick off in the UK, before being rolled out to European markets, including Germany, Italy, and beyond. The move is the next step in ITV Studios&rsquo; on-going growth into the rapidly evolving FAST/AVoD market and one of many ways they are looking to exploit the rich catalogue of 90,000 hours of content. It follows the launch of four non-scripted YouTube channels last year &#150; Our World, Our Life, Our Stories, Our Histories, showcasing the most successful nature documentaries and everyday lives that shape Britain, amongst other content.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are very excited to partner with Samsung TV Plus to launch FAST channels in EMEA,&rdquo; declared Ruth Berry, Managing Director at ITV Studios Global Distribution. &ldquo;We have an amazing library of 90,000+ hours of IP and the FAST/AVOD space is a key strategic focus for ITV Studios as we look to provide global audiences with new ways to access some of our best known scripted brands, formats and non-scripted entertainment content.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The growth of Samsung TV Plus has everything to do with the quality of the content,&rdquo; stated Richard Jakeman, European Head of Business Development for Samsung. &ldquo;We are working hard to deliver the best content possible to our customers, wherever they are. The addition of Storylands by ITV Studios and Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen will enforce our commitment to a wide variety of quality programming for everyone.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>FAST channels are designed to mimic live television with ads, as opposed to on-demand subscription-based services. Samsung TV Plus, Samsung&rsquo;s free ad-supported app delivering instant access to an ever-growing library of channels, will broadcast content from the ITV Studios catalogue 24/7 across all 2016 onwards Samsung Smart TVs as well as select Galaxy devices.<br>

			</p>
			<p>MANILA, Philippines &#151; The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) is supporting early preparatory efforts to establish satellite-based internet connectivity in the Philippines.</p>
			<p>Acting DICT Secretary Emmanuel Rey Caintic said that the establishment of satellite-based internet connectivity services in the country was a step forward in the national government&rsquo;s push toward digital transformation.</p>
			<p>Caintic said that DICT was continuously coordinating with government agencies such as the Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA) and private sector groups such as the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) for the conduct of tests on delivering satellite-based internet in different areas of the country.</p>
			<p>DICT recently partnered with the PCCI to pilot test satellite broadband connectivity in select remote sites with limited or no internet access. The PCCI has not named the outfit providing the satellite-based internet that they will have tested with the DICT.</p>
			<p>The agency had supported the signing of Executive Order 127 in 2020, which amended EO 467 of 1998 to remove the franchise requirement in the access of international satellite systems.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Your DICT believes that the adoption of satellite-based internet connectivity in the country would advance our digital transformation agenda. To help the government, businesses, schools, and the larger society, we need to fast-track the buildup of our ICT infrastructure to meet the increase in demand,&rdquo; Caintic said.<br>

			<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s announcement validates our strategic approach to expand our offering across the value chain while enhancing our ability to provide end-to-end secure and critical satellite solutions and connectivity,&rdquo; said Ali Al Hashemi, group chief executive at Yahsat.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This further demonstrates the strength of our relationship with the UAE government, with whom we have had a strong partnership for over 10 years.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The latest deal also provides &ldquo;more visibility&rdquo; on the long-term financial outlook of the company, he said.</p>
			<p>Yahsat has been providing operations and maintenance services since 2011 on its first two satellites, Al Yah 1 and Al Yah 2, under a 15-year capacity services agreement with the UAE government.</p>
			<p>Last year, the company was requested by the government to explore options for two new satellites &#150; Al Yah 4 and Al Yah 5, which are set to be launched by 2026.</p>
			<p>Yahsat, a unit of Mubadala Investment Company, raised about $731m from its initial public offering last July.</p>
			<p>It sold 975.9 million shares, or 40 per cent of equity through the IPO, which was several times oversubscribed, with significant demand from both qualified institutional and retail investors in the UAE, Yahsat said at the time.</p>
			<p>Earlier this month, Yahsat secured a Dh24m contract from Abu Dhabi Ship Building to deliver secure satellite communication solutions.</p>
			<p>As a part of the deal, it will design, deliver and integrate the satellite communication systems in vessels made by the ship builder, the Abu Dhabi Media Office said in a February 10 statement.</p>
			<p>The company offers multi-mission satellite services in more than 150 countries across Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe, the Middle East and South America.</p>
			<p>Yahsat, which is among the top-10 satellite operators in the world by revenue, expects income from its global data services to significantly rise once it adds new technology and launches another satellite into orbit in 2023, Mr Al Hashemi told The National in September.</p>
			<p>It currently earns a large chunk of its income from voice services.<br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/02/11/oneweb-launches-another-34-satellites/<br>
			</p>
			<p>OneWeb, the low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications company, has confirmed the successful deployment of 34 satellites by Arianespace from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana.</p>
			<p>This launch, the Company&rsquo;s first in 2022 and 13th overall, brings OneWeb&rsquo;s total in-orbit constellation to 428 satellites. It represents 66 per cent of OneWeb&rsquo;s planned 648 LEO satellite fleet that will deliver high-speed, low-latency global connectivity.  </p>
			<p>This launch kicks off a successful start to 2022 as OneWeb says demand for its broadband connectivity services has continued to grow across telecommunications providers, aviation and maritime markets, ISPs and governments worldwide. Most recently, OneWeb has signed new distribution partnership agreements with several companies in the last month &#150; including Hughes Network Systems, Marlink, and Field Solutions Holdings &#150; to help ensure connectivity is delivered to the most hard-to-reach places globally.</p>
			<p> Lift-off of the latest launch occurred on February 10th. OneWeb&rsquo;s satellites separated from the rocket and were dispensed in nine batches over a period of 3 hours 33 minutes with signal acquisition on all 34 satellites confirmed. </p>
			<p>Neil Masterson, OneWeb CEO, commented: &ldquo;Our first launch of the year marks our significant progress in completing a truly global LEO network later in 2022. We continue to see growing demand for OneWeb&rsquo;s industry-leading services as we look forward to delivering on our ambition to build robust, secure, and global access to broadband services.&rdquo;<br>

				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Russian_Soyuz_rocket_launches_34_new_UK_satellites_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>A Russian Soyuz rocket has blasted into space carrying 34 new satellites from British operator Oneweb, which aims to provide broadband internet everywhere in the world. </p>
			<p>The rocket, operated by Europe's Arianespace, took off at 1807 GMT Tuesday from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, broadcast live by the Russian Roscosmos space agency.</p>
			<p>&quot;The launch went to plan,&quot; Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin said on Telegram. </p>
			<p>It was the sixth launch of OneWeb satellites this year, the last one having been on August 22. </p>
			<p>OneWeb is working to complete the construction of a constellation of low-earth orbit satellites providing enhanced broadband and other services to countries worldwide.</p>
			<p>The company is competing against billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos in the race to provide fast internet for the world's remote areas via satellites.</p>
			<p>The UK company plans for its global commercial internet service to be operational by next year, supported by some 650 satellites.</p>
			<p>Arianespace, which has worked with Russia for close to two decades, is under contract to make 16 Soyuz launches between December 2020 and the end of 2022. </p>
			<p>With this latest mission, a total of 288 satellites are now in orbit for the constellation.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/astra-space-fails-deliver-satellites-orbit-first-operational-launch-2022-02-10/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Feb 10 (Reuters) - California-based launch service Astra Space Inc (ASTR.O)suffered a major blow in its quest to join the burgeoning club of new ventures partnering with NASA, as its rocket failed on Thursday to deliver the startup's first commercial payload to orbit.</p>
			<p>Shares of Astra Space, which went public in July, tumbled on news of the setback, dropping by as much as 38% during Thursday trading on the Nasdaq to an all-time low of $3.25. They closed at $3.91, down 26%.</p>
			<p>Astra's two-stage, kerosene-fueled Launch Vehicle 0008, also known as Rocket 3.3, was carrying four miniature research satellites, or CubeSats, for NASA. Three of them were developed by public universities and one by the space agency itself.</p>
			<p>Word of the mission's failure came about 14 minutes after the 38-foot-tall rocket blasted off at 3 p.m. EST (1000 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and soared into the clear blue skies over Florida in what appeared at first to be a seamless flight.</p>
			<p>A video camera feed from the upper stage of the rocket was lost about five minutes after launch, followed by a lengthy pause in Astra's commentary during its livestream of the event.</p>
			<p>Astra director of product management Carolina Grossman finally broke the suspense to announce that an unspecified &quot;issue has been experienced during flight that prevented the delivery of our customer payloads to orbit.&quot;</p>
			<p>&quot;More information will be provided as we complete a data review,&quot; she said, adding that the company was &quot;deeply sorry to our customers.&quot;</p>
			<p>The failed flight came on the third launch try of the mission, designated by NASA as ELaNA 41.</p>
			<p>The previous attempt, on Monday, was aborted at T-minus zero of the countdown, just as the rocket's engines were about to ignite. Astra officials said Monday's launch was automatically scrubbed when systems detected a minor telemetry glitch, which they later said was resolved and would not have affected the flight in any case.</p>
			<p>Headquartered in Alameda, California, Astra is one of a growing array of new firms building small-payload launch systems to cash in on the exponential growth in compact satellites needing a ride to orbit.</p>
			<p>Front-runners in this class of commercial space ventures include Firefly Aerospace, owned by entrepreneur Max Polyakov, U.S.-New Zealand startup Rocket Lab (RKLB.O) and British billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit (VORB.O).</p>
			<p>The boom has been driven in part by venture cash and technology advances that have reduced the size, and boosted the capabilities, of satellites used for purposes ranging from communications to national security and climate research.</p>
			<p>Astra boasts of becoming the first rocket company to reach orbit in less than five years with the flight of an earlier rocket, Launch Vehicle 0007, which demonstrated orbital placement of a test payload in November 2021.</p>
			<p>The ELaNa initiative, short for the Educational Launch of Nanosatellites, has sent more than 100 CubeSats to orbit since its 2010 inception under NASA's Launch Services Program, which contracted with Astra for Thursday's ill-fated mission.<br>

			<p><b><i>HKATG to launch 25 satellites this year<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From http://spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=59393<br>
			</p>
			<p>Hong Kong Aerospace Technology Group, Ltd. (HK: 1725) (HKATG), a leading aerospace firm traded on the Hong Kong stock exchange (HKEx) announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Gang Hang Ke (Shenzhen) Space Technology (&quot;SZ Gang Hang Ke&quot;) has entered into a second satellite launch service confirmation agreement with China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC), a state-owned enterprise in Mainland China.</p>
			<p>Under the agreement, SZ Gang Hang Ke is tentatively scheduled to launch the two satellites, Golden Bauhinia Satellite No. 3 and Golden Bauhinia Satellite No. 4, in July of this year. The continued launching of satellites is expected to speed up the timetable for the completion the Golden Bauhinia Constellation project as well as enhance the operations of the smart city in the process of being rolled out in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA). HKATG plans to launch 25 satellites in 2022.</p>
			<p>The Golden Bauhinia Constellation project begins to take shape</p>
			<p>According to HKATG's official website, the group's aerospace commercialization efforts focus on two segments: the build out of the satellite constellation and the precision manufacturing of satellites. Golden Bauhinia is an active-passive hybrid low-orbit high-frequency satellite constellation that combines optical remote sensing and synthetic aperture radar to form an all-weather and near-real-time dynamic monitoring system equipped with specialized applications. The system is driven by real-time satellite communication and navigation functions that provide full-cycle monitoring of the construction of GBA's smart city of the future and supporting infrastructure so as to assure the conservation and sustainability of the local environment.</p>
			<p>The Golden Bauhinia constellation project was launched in 2021. SZ Gang Hang Ke signed satellite launching and confirmation agreements with CGWIC in August, October, and December of last year. Five satellites including Golden Bauhinia Satellite No. 1 (01), Golden Bauhinia Satellite No. 1 (02), Golden Bauhinia Satellite No. 2, Golden Bauhinia Satellite No. 5 and Golden Bauhinia Satellite No. 1 (03) were launched in April, October and December.</p>
			<p>This year, HKATG plans to significantly accelerate the rate of expansion of the constellation. According to the latest announcement, besides the planned launches of Golden Bauhinia Satellites No. 3 and No. 4 in July of this year, the group will launch a total of 25 satellites in 2022. The growth in the number of satellites will allow for the collection of substantially more data as well as vastly increase data transmission speed, which, in turn, will enhance the quality of the data and application services being provided by the constellation. The effort will facilitate the development of various industrial and commercial activities related to remote sensing data processing, software development, and other professional value-added services in Hong Kong.</p>
			<p>Huge breakthroughs for satellite manufacturing</p>
			<p>Following on HKATG's expansion in the scope of operations last year, the firm is expected to usher in major breakthroughs on the road to commercialization this year. In October and November of last year, the group inked contracts for the procurement and servicing of complete assembly equipment as well as for equipment configuration and installation with CGWIC and the Research Institute of Tsinghua University in Shenzhen (RITS). The fulfillment of the contracts is seen as a massive breakthrough in HKATG's satellite manufacturing and testing capability. </p>
			<p>This year, the Group's first satellite constructed in its Hong Kong facilities is expected to be launched in July, simultaneously with the planned launches of Golden Bauhinia Satellites No. 3 and No. 4.</p>
			<p>HKATG expects to soon achieve scale commercialization in both its satellite constellation and aerospace businesses, less than two years after the group's founding in September 2019 and backdoor listing on the HKEx in April of last year.</p>
			<p>With a market potential that reaches some trillions of dollars, HKATG foresees substantial growth year after year following the huge breakthroughs achieved last year.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Dozens_of_SpaceX_internet_satellites_lost_to_geomagnetic_storm_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>Up to 40 SpaceX high-speed internet satellites have been knocked out of orbit by a geomagnetic storm shortly after launch, but pose little threat to Earth as they burn up in the atmosphere, the company said.</p>
			<p>Geomagnetic storms are caused by ejections of the solar corona into space, resulting in disturbances to the Earth's upper atmosphere and increased drag on objects in low orbits.</p>
			<p>The latest 49 satellites from the Starlink network launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on February 3 and successfully assumed their initial orbit, with their nearest approach to the surface 130 miles (210 kilometers) high.</p>
			<p>The company places them into this region to carry out final checks before flying further into space.</p>
			<p>On February 4, however, they were struck by the space weather event, Elon Musk's company said in a statement late Tuesday.</p>
			<p>&quot;These storms cause the atmosphere to warm and atmospheric density at our low deployment altitudes to increase. In fact, onboard GPS suggests the escalation speed and severity of the storm caused atmospheric drag to increase up to 50 percent higher than during previous launches,&quot; it said.</p>
			<p>The Starlink team commanded the satellites into a safe mode, where they would fly edge-on -- like a sheet of paper -- to minimize drag as they sought shelter.</p>
			<p>But despite the evasive maneuver, most were unable to raise their orbits, and as many as 40 &quot;will reenter or already have reentered the Earth's atmosphere.&quot;</p>
			<p>The company insisted they posed &quot;zero collision risk&quot; with other satellites and are designed to disintegrate upon re-entry, with no debris expected to hit the ground.</p>
			<p>The UK Space Agency agreed in a blog post that there was &quot;virtually no risk&quot; since the satellites are built without any dense metallic components and should burn up entirely, but said it was monitoring closely. NASA has not yet commented.</p>
			<p>Apart from increasing atmospheric drag, geomagnetic storms can wreak havoc with satellites' computer circuitry and thus cause them to fail, according to space industry analyst Seradata.</p>
			<p>Whatever the exact cause, the loss could point to a design weakness in Starlink satellites' ability to withstand such storms, Seradata's David Todd wrote in a post. </p>
			<p>But it is not expected to impact the overall functioning of the Starlink &quot;constellation.&quot; </p>
			<p>SpaceX has launched more than 2,000 of the satellites since May 2019, with more than 1,500 currently operational, providing internet coverage across most of the planet. </p>
			<p>The company currently has regulatory approval for 12,000 satellites, with plans to expand even further.</p>
			<p>Astronomers have raised concerns about their impact on ground-based astronomy as they add to a congested environment in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).</p>
			<p>There are approximately 4,000 active satellites in this space, which extends to 1,200 miles above the surface, as well as 15,000 pieces of debris like rocket bodies and defunct probes, according to the UK Space Agency.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Indian_Space_Agency_decommissions_communication_satellite_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>The ISRO said that decommissioning was completed, in accordance with UN space debris mitigation guidelines.</p>
			<p>Space debris has become a real concern for space exploration agencies worldwide. According to estimates, there are 7,200 artificial satellites in total orbiting Earth and 27,000 pieces of man-made debris caught in orbit.</p>
			<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has successfully decommissioned a 14-year-old communication satellite, INSAT-4B, which provided services in the Ku and C frequency bands.</p>
			<p>Before starting the process, the bandwidth payload services such as DTH were seamlessly migrated to other geostationary satellites.</p>
			<p>The ISRO said that decommissioning was completed, in accordance with UN space debris mitigation guidelines.</p>
			<p>According to guidelines, any geostationary satellites should be raised to a nearly circular orbit well above the Geo belt to prevent its orbit from returning into the GEO-protected region within 100 years of re-orbiting. In the case related to the 3,025 kg INSAT-4B, the minimum orbit to which it was required to be raised was 273km.</p>
			<p>&quot;The finally achieved orbit is about 340km above Geo altitude in perfect compliance with Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) guidelines for space debris mitigation of Geo objects,&quot; the ISRO said on Tuesday, adding INSAT-4B was the 21st Indian Geo satellite to undergo post-mission disposal.</p>
			<p>The decommissioning was achieved after 11 re-orbiting manoeuvres executed between 17 and 23 January 2022.</p>
			<p>The agency used the required propellant for such re-orbiting so that the satellite could be removed safely from orbit and avoid endangering any orbiting satellites.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2022/02/09/disney-experiments-with-first-livestream/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Disney+ has dipped its toe into livestreaming for the first time.</p>
			<p>On February 8, the company ran a livestream of the  94th Oscar nominations on Disney+ in the US, with the event also livestreamed to Hulu, ABC News Live and the Academy Awards own platforms.</p>
			<p>To date, Disney has shown no aspiration to make Disney+ into a livestreaming platform, with live content typically better suited to sports streamer ESPN+ or Hulu + Live TV. This however marks a change in tact, with TechCrunch reporting that the company is exploring what it can do with live content on the platform with plans to continue testing in the future.</p>
			<p>A statement from a spokesperson provided to press said: &ldquo;We performed a test for livestreaming capabilities on Disney+ in the U.S. with this morning&rsquo;s Academy Award nominations. We are pleased with the results and will continue to test as part of our ongoing and iterative approach to deliver the best user experiences to consumers.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>At last count, Disney+ was at 118.1 million by the end of its Q4 2021. Disney will announce its streaming figures when it reveals its Q1 2022 results on February 9, with the company hoping to bounce back from a disappointing Q4.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/02/10/disney-adds-another-11-8m-subs/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Disney+ has continued to defy expectations with the SVoD service adding 11.8 million subscribers in the last three months of 2021, taking the total to 129.8 million globally.</p>
			<p>Disney CEO Bob Chapek predicted the service will have 230 million to 260 million subscribers by 2024.</p>
			<p>Overall, the company&rsquo;s revenues increased by 34 per cent year-on-year to $21.8 billion (&euro;19.08bn) for the quarter, while profits rose to $1.1 billion.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This marks the final year of the Walt Disney Company&rsquo;s first century, and performance like this coupled with our unmatched collection of assets and platforms, creative capabilities, and unique place in the culture give me great confidence we will continue to define entertainment for the next 100 years,&rdquo; Chapek said.</p>
			<p>However, even as Disney+ subscribers jumped, executives warned that revenue from cinema releases has yet to recover &#150; despite the recent success of Spider-Man: No Way Home (which is a joint production with Sony).</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Disney&rsquo;s US theme parks hit record highs in the last three months of 2021.<br>

			<p>Aid efforts are continuing as the Kingdom of Tonga recovers from the recent volcanic eruption of Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha&rsquo;apai. The violent blast generated a Tsunami and blanketed the islands in volcanic ash. Video / Supplied</p>
			<p>Engineers for SpaceX, owned by the world's richest man Elon Musk, are reportedly in Fiji with plans to help restore internet to the Kingdom of Tonga.</p>
			<p>The devastating eruption in mid-January damaged an undersea telecommunications cable, which experts have said could take a month to repair.</p>
			<p>National Party MP Dr Shane Reti wrote a letter to Musk, who also produces electric cars under the Tesla brand, asking for help to provide his Starlink satellite technology to the Pacific country.</p>
			<p>The technology uses satellites to deliver internet access to remote locations around the world.</p>
			<p>Musk replied offering to assist Tonga, asking on Twitter whether Tonga authorities could inform him whether Starlink terminals were needed.</p>
			<p>The Fiji Broadcasting Corporation, FBC News, reports that the team from SpaceX are now in Fiji to work on an internet gateway for the Kingdom of Tonga.</p>
			<p>Minister for Communications Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum confirmed the news to FBC News, saying the engineers from SpaceX will establish and operate a temporary ground station in Fiji for six months.</p>
			<p>&quot;The Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (Space X) had applied for a temporary emergency telecommunications license on the 20th of Jan, the sole purpose of this license is to provide an internet gateway,&quot; Sayed-Khaiyum told FBC News.</p>
			<p>&quot;Space X and FINTEL are currently, however, in commercial negotiations to co-locate the earth station and connect to Fiji's internet gateway.&quot;</p>
			<p>SpaceX has also reportedly shown interest in providing internet services in Fiji.</p>
			<p>The Herald has approached Sayed-Khaiyum for comment.</p>
			<p>Reti said it was &quot;wonderful news&quot;.</p>
			<p>&quot;I am just really pleased for Tonga and all the Pacific that they will be getting modern telecommunications.&quot;</p>
			<p>Reti said he had been in contact with the Tongan consul and Minister for Pacific Peoples, Aupito William Sio, who were pleased to hear the news.<br>

			<p><b><i>ABC and SBS to receive $4.2 billion in funding growth over next three-year period<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://tvblackbox.com.au/page/2022/02/07/abc-and-sbs-to-receive-4-2-billion-in-funding-growth-over-next-three-year-period/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The news comes only months out from an imminent election, and despite heavy criticism towards the federal government for previously cutting funding to the ABC.</p>
			<p>The federal Morrison Government has locked in committed and growing funding of $4.2 billion for both the ABC and SBS over a three-year period from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2025.</p>
			<p>Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts, Mr Paul Fletcher, announced the news on Monday morning.</p>
			<p>He said the funding will allow the ABC and SBS to continue to provide innovative, comprehensive and high quality television, radio and digital media services to all Australians.</p>
			<p>Fletcher continued:</p>
			<p>    &ldquo;The ABC and SBS are essential components of Australia&rsquo;s diverse media landscape.</p>
			<p>    &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve delivered an increase in funding for both national broadcasters compared to both the 2016-19 and 2019-22 funding period. This funding commitment is designed to provide certainty for both broadcasters and is being announced well in advance of the next funding period to assist the ABC and SBS to develop their forward plans.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The ABC will receive $3,284.9 million over the next three years. This includes $45.8 million under the Enhanced News Gathering program to strengthen local public interest journalism in regional communities. This is an increase of $87.2 million over the current triennium.</p>
			<p>The ABC will also benefit from a return of indexation on base operational funding as outlined in the May 2021 Budget papers.</p>
			<p>SBS will receive $953.7 million, including an additional $37.5 million in ongoing funding to support its long-term sustainability. This is an increase of $56.7 million over the current triennium. A table setting out the funding commitment is attached.</p>
			<p>The ABC and SBS will also receive additional funding to support the continuation and expansion of audio description services to blind and vision impaired Australians.</p>
			<p>Minister Fletcher has today written to the ABC and SBS outlining their three-year funding packages, and issued Statements of Expectations regarding the reporting by the two organisations in relation to a number of their key activities&#151;including a new National Broadcasters Reporting Framework for Australian Content, and, in the case of the ABC, its rural and regional activities.</p>
			<p>ABC Chair Ita Buttrose said:</p>
			<p>    &ldquo;I am delighted with the Government&rsquo;s decision to commit $3.3 billion over the next three years to the ABC. It will allow the national broadcaster to continue doing what it does best &#150; provide information and entertainment to Australians wherever they live.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>ABC Managing Director David Anderson said:</p>
			<p>    &ldquo;I welcome the funding certainty this announcement brings to the national broadcaster for the next three years. The $3.3 billion over the next triennium, announced by the Minister Paul Fletcher, sees the resumption of indexation, the continuation of the Enhanced Newsgathering (ENG) program that provides vital services across the country, and ongoing support for audio description services for blind or visually impaired audiences.</p>
			<p>    &ldquo;ENG funding has delivered more tailored news to local communities and has seen the ABC invest more in specialist resources that provide vital context and analysis about issues that matter to all Australians. Importantly, this announcement also guarantees the ability of the ABC to continue to reinvest funds from the recently concluded Google and Facebook deals into rural and regional services.</p>
			<p>    &ldquo;I would like to thank the Minister, Paul Fletcher, and the Government for recognising the enduring value of the ABC as we mark 90  years of serving Australians.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Triennium funding for National Broadcasters &#150; 2022-23 to 2024-25</p>
			<p>*Note: this is a three-year funding commitment, expiring on 30 June 2024, for additional news services in Arabic and Mandarin. A decision on whether to extend this funding will be taken as part of the 2024/25 Budget, based upon an assessment of the performance of these additional services.<br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/02/07/no-delay-for-intelsats-bankruptcy-exit/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The trial between SES and Intelsat over how the FCC&rsquo;s C-band &lsquo;incentive payments&rsquo; are being distributed opens on February 7th. The court has set aside up to two weeks for the hearings before Intelsat&rsquo;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy judge Keith Phillips.</p>
			<p>However, last week the judge delayed an element of the trial dispute revolving around a witness requested by Intelsat (Mr James Murray) who would be arguing that any damages claim by SES be reduced. The judge ruled that Murray&rsquo;s evidence can be delayed in order to be deposed by SES and for SES to themselves draw a new witness who would challenge the Murray evidence.</p>
			<p>Despite this delay &#150; and SES insiders say they no timetable yet for the delayed hearing &#150; which in any event will finally depend on the availability of court time and the parties themselves. SES, and other experts following the overall cases do not anticipate the further legal manoeuvres delaying Intelsat&rsquo;s exit from bankruptcy.</p>
			<p>February 8th will see Intelsat hold a virtual Extraordinary General Meeting in Luxembourg where it will call on shareholders to vote to support and &ldquo;Approve the sale and transfer of the entire issued share capital of Intelsat Holdings SA (&ldquo;Holdings&rdquo;), being an indirect subsidiary of the Company, by Intelsat Investment Holdings S&agrave;rl (&ldquo;Investment Holdings&rdquo;), being a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to Intelsat Emergence SA, a joint stock company (soci&eacute;t&eacute; anonyme) (&ldquo;New Topco&rdquo;).</p>
			<p>Existing directors will resign, and new directors appointed. Fifty-seven quadrillion new shares will be issued (57,229,268,495,000,000).<br>

			<p>The World Teleport Association (WTA) has revealed its annual rankings for Top teleport Operator of 2021. SES, headquartered in Luxembourg but with other important teleports in Europe and the US, takes the Number 1 spot.</p>
			<p>WTA says its annual rankings of companies by revenue and revenue growth are compiled by surveying teleport operators around the world as well as referencing the published results of publicly held companies.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The rapid advance of LEO and MEO networks has focused the industry&rsquo;s attention on the vital role of ground segment in closing the link,&rdquo; said WTA executive director Robert Bell. &ldquo;Our association was founded in 1985 on this very idea: that the intelligence of the global satellite network is largely provided by teleport operators developing high-value solutions for customer problems. Our Top Operators lists continue to celebrate that fact.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The WTA&rsquo;s Global Top 20 of 2021 are:</p>
			<p>1. SES (Luxembourg)</p>

			<p><b><i>Greg Wyler says E-Space&rsquo;s vast &lsquo;mesh&rsquo; network will clean up debris and bring it back to earth<br>
					</i></b><br>

			</p>
			<p>Greg Wyler while at OneWeb in 2019. He said: &lsquo;The more satellites we have, the cleaner space will be&rsquo; &copy; Sarah L Voisin/The Washington Post/Getty</p>
			<p>We&rsquo;ll send you a myFT Daily Digest email rounding up the latest Space industry news every morning.</p>
			<p>Greg Wyler, the space entrepreneur who founded Britain&rsquo;s OneWeb, plans to put up to 100,000 satellites in orbit this decade with his latest business venture E-Space.</p>
			<p>The company on Monday said it had raised $50mn in seed funding from Prime Movers Lab, a fund that invests in breakthrough scientific start-ups.</p>
			<p>E-Space aims to create a vast &ldquo;mesh&rdquo; network of small satellites that can deliver bespoke and commercial services to business and government, from secure communications to remote infrastructure management.</p>
			<p>Wyler&rsquo;s plans come as the world becomes increasingly concerned about the risk of collisions in orbit and resulting space debris.</p>
			<p>Since 2019 the number of working satellites has risen 50 per cent to roughly 5,000, largely because new commercial groups are exploiting lower launch costs to build businesses in low-earth orbit, 150km-200km above the earth. Elon Musk aims to launch some 40,000 satellites for his Starlink internet service.</p>
			<p>The European Space Agency estimates 330m pieces of debris less than 1cm across and 36,500 greater than 10cm are orbiting the planet.</p>
			<p>This poses a serious risk to operational satellites. A fleck of paint just a few thousandths of a millimetre across cracked the window of the International Space Station in 2016.</p>
			<p>Wyler insisted E-Space will leave low-earth orbit cleaner than before its satellites are launched, with a network that will collect and deorbit debris even as it provides connectivity services.</p>
			<p>The satellites have a substantially smaller cross section than rivals, Wyler told the Financial Times, and will be designed to &ldquo;crumple&rdquo; rather than break apart when struck. They will also &ldquo;entrain&rdquo; any debris they encounter and automatically deorbit when a certain amount has been collected.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Like oysters in the river that filter the river and clean it, our satellites are the first to be designed to clean space,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The more satellites we have, the cleaner space will be.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Anton Brevde, partner at Prime Movers Lab and on the board of E-Space, suggested Wyler&rsquo;s innovative design would do for satellites what Apple&rsquo;s iPhone did for mobile phones.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;How do you minimise a 300kg sat to something that is an order of magnitude smaller? How do you go from the personal computer to the iPhone, something that is smaller and thinner,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a whole bunch of innovation that came together. He has been brainstorming for years on how to make communications satellites as small and cheap as possible.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Wyler is one of the space industry&rsquo;s best-known innovators, having founded the 03b network now owned by Luxembourg&rsquo;s SES and then OneWeb, a pioneer of low-earth orbit internet services.</p>
			<p>In 2020 OneWeb, having raised more than $3bn from investors, collapsed into bankruptcy after investor SoftBank refused to back a new funding round. It was eventually rescued by the UK government and India&rsquo;s Bharti telecom group, and is rolling out commercial services this year.</p>
			<p>Wyler, who left OneWeb in 2017, said he had learnt many lessons from the experience, the most important of which was not to invite suppliers to invest in E-Space.</p>
			<p>OneWeb drew investment from Airbus, which manufactured the satellites, Virgin Group, whose Virgin Galactic provided launch services, and Qualcomm, which helped design some of the satellite technology.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;OneWeb was captive to its shareholders for products,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All the cost growth came from the shareholders.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>E-Space &ldquo;must be able to freely decide on its technology path, on its vendor selection and on its component path, where shareholders are purely financial as opposed to strategic,&rdquo; he added.</p>
			<p>The start-up plans to launch its first test satellites next month and a second batch at the end of the year, after which it aims to start building its constellation.</p>
			<p>Wyler acknowledged that E-Space was likely to require another funding round but insisted his network would cost a fraction of existing LEO constellations. &ldquo;The historical model of spending $5bn-$10bn is broken,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are running at about 10 per cent of the cost of prior LEO constellations.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>E-Space has all the licences needed to be able to deliver the service on multiple frequencies, Wyler said. They had been acquired through Rwanda, which last year applied to the International Telecommunications Union in Geneva to license more than 300,000 satellites. The Rwandan government was an original investor in OneWeb.<br>

			<p>Producer, distributor and channel operator Blue Ant Media has expanded its move into free advertising supported streaming TV (FAST) by launching TotalCrime, a new FAST channel on The Roku Channel in the US.</p>
			<p>Blue Ant said the launch of the true crime-themed channel built on its expansion into the emerging free streaming space and followed FAST channel launches including Love Nature, HauntTV and CrimeTime, TotalCrime&rsquo;s sister channel, which launched on Roku in Canada in March 2021.</p>
			<p>Blue Ant Media&rsquo;s suite of FAST channels spans platforms such as The Roku Channel, Xumo, Samsung TV Plus, VIZIO WatchFree+ and PrendeTV.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Audiences are hungry for true crime programming and TotalCrime&rsquo;s lineup is jam-packed with exclusive true crime series and documentaries they can&rsquo;t find anywhere else,&rdquo; says Jamie Schouela, President, Global Channels and Media, Blue Ant Media.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The fact that our Canadian crime streaming channel has grown 220% in the last nine months makes us confident that TotalCrime channel will become a fan-favourite for The Roku Channel&rsquo;s US viewers. Given Blue Ant&rsquo;s history connecting with niche audiences, we&rsquo;re well-positioned to continue bringing new channels to the exploding free streaming space.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>News Corp upbeat on Foxtel despite earnings fall<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/news-corp-buoyed-by-strong-ad-demand-and-payments-from-big-tech-20220204-p59tqz.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson says he is increasingly confident in the future of pay TV and streaming company Foxtel, even as a boost in subscriber numbers came at the expense of earnings.</p>
			<p>Foxtel has 3.9 million paid subscribers as of December 31, but its revenue fell 3 per cent to US$498 million ($698 million) in the December quarter. Earnings [before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation] for the subscription video segment fell 31 per cent to US$86 million as discount offers were used to boost uptake and many customers opted for lower-cost streaming instead of traditional pay TV.</p>
			<p>The results, which News Corp attributed to a fall in residential broadcast revenue, the closure of pubs and clubs and the popularity of sports events such as the Ashes on free-to-air TV, come as senior executives at the media conglomerate mull whether a public listing is the best step forward for the business.<br>
				News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson says the company remains upbeat on Foxtel.</p>

			<p>Mr Thomson said sport seasonality was a factor in the performance, but pointed to the growing subscriber figures of streaming services Kayo Sports and Binge.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are increasingly confident in Foxtel&rsquo;s future and thus actively looking at ways to maximise its value and ensure that we can build on that success,&rdquo; Mr Thomson said. &ldquo;Commercial venues were partially offset by strong growth in streaming revenues, which now account for 19 per cent of circulation and subscription revenues.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Foxtel has 2.2 million paid subscribers across Kayo Sports, Binge and Foxtel Now - a slight increase from 2.1 million subscribers in the previous quarter - but the average revenue per user across the streaming platforms is not publicly disclosed. The closure of Telstra Live Pass last February led to a $5 per month offer on Kayo Sports for existing customers for a 12-month period, a significant discount on the usual $25 per month subscription.</p>
			<p>    &lsquo;We are increasingly confident in Foxtel&rsquo;s future and thus actively looking at ways to maximise its value and ensure that we can build on that success.&rsquo;<br>
				    News Corp CEO Robert Thomson</p>
			<p>Kayo Sports has 1.01 million paid subscribers and Binge has 928,000 paid subscribers, buoyed by the return of its hit program Succession. In the previous quarter, these figures were 1.06 million and 885,000, respectively. Average revenue per user climbed 3 percent to $82 and broadcast churn declined to 13 per cent, which is the lowest level since the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.</p>
			<p>News Corp and Telstra, which jointly own Foxtel, have been weighing up the prospect of a public float of Foxtel since mid last year. Sources close to Foxtel, who spoke anonymously, said a decision on the best way forward has not been decided. There are several other factors outside of Foxtel&rsquo;s performance that will determine whether an IPO goes ahead.</p>
			<p>Brian Han, analyst at Morningstar said Foxtel was the only &ldquo;lowlight&rdquo; in the result.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Still, it&rsquo;s going to agitate investors into thinking whether News missed the boat on IPO, what with Netflix&rsquo;s slowing growth, market turbulence and concerns about how much competition can this SVOD market take,&rdquo; he said.<br>
				Ad sales, Big Tech payments buoy group profits</p>
			<p>The video segment of News Corp was the only operating segment of Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s empire to report a drop in revenue. The media company, which locally publishes The Australian, The Herald Sun and The Daily Telegraph, reported a 13 per cent uptick in revenue to US$2.72 billion for the December quarter, driven by strong property listings and advertising sales as well as payments from its content deals with tech giants Google and Facebook.</p>
			<p>Net income came in flat at $US262 million for the second quarter, while higher revenues across most of its divisions took segment earnings [before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation] to $US586 million.</p>
			<p>Adjusted revenues - which exclude foreign current impacts, acquisitions and divestments - were up 8 per cent for the three months to December 31.</p>
			<p>Mr Thomson said it was the best quarterly result for the organisation since the company was formed in 2013.</p>
			<p>Foxtel CEO Patrick Delany spent the last few years transforming the business from a cable TV operator to a streaming company.</p>
			<p>Foxtel&rsquo;s IPO call edges closer as streaming shine wears thin</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The landmark agreements with Big Tech continued to benefit our journalism and our bottom line,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In addition to the substantial deals with Google and Facebook, we expanded our multi-year global agreement with Apple, which is expected to be an important source of subscriptions and of advertising revenue for our news sites around the world.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>News Media, the division that includes newspapers in the US and Australia, grew 11 per cent to $US638 million.</p>
			<p>Real estate listings portal REA Group reported a 27 per cent increase in the first half of the financial year to $368 million and a net profit increase of 31 per cent to $226 million, which it attributed to a bounce back in consumer confidence that had come from the end of lockdowns in Victoria and NSW.</p>
			<p>REA boss Owen Wilson said that while listings typically fall in the leadup to an election, bank liquidity and low rates would keep the market strong. He said forecasted unemployment rates - which are predicted to be below 4 per cent by the end of the year - would also underpin the market.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Even after a couple of rises, interest rates will still be historically low level and if that unemployment rate prediction is true, that&rsquo;s going to be the lowest unemployment rate in decades. Consumer confidence, which is a key driver of the market, I think will still be strong,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>REA Group shareholders will receive an interim fully franked dividend of 75.0 cents per share - a 27% increase on the prior year. Meanwhile, News Corporation declared an interim dividend of 10 US cents per share, payable on April 13.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://satellitetoday.com/business/2022/02/03/viasat-3-launch-slips-to-late-summer-2022/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Viasat continued its streak of record revenues in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, but pushed the highly anticipated Viasat-3 satellite launch to late summer. </p>
			<p>The company provided an update on the Viasat-3 program in Thursday&rsquo;s financial results and said supplier issues caused the schedule slip. The satellite has been pushed back before, and previously was targeted for launch in the first half of 2022. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been working through limited availability of specific critical skill workers,&rdquo; CEO Rick Baldridge said on Thursday&rsquo;s investor call. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made really good progress on Alpha testing of our space-ground system integration, using one of our on-orbit satellites. We&rsquo;re looking to take advantage of that to manage on-orbit testing so we can maintain commencement of initial services by the end of the calendar year, consistent with what we said before. We don&rsquo;t expect this to materially affect our financial outlook.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>The first ViaSat-3 payload is being readied for thermal vacuum testing at Boeing, which the company called a major milestone in final spacecraft integration. </p>
			<p>This first satellite will cover the Americas, and is one of three. Viasat said about 95% of the payload unit has been installed on the second satellite, which will cover Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. It is set for launch about six months after the first. Also this week, Viasat announced Australian telecommunications company Telstra as a partner for the ground deployment for the third satellite which will cover the Asia-Pacific region. <br>

			</p>
			<p>Bangladesh Satellite Company Limited and Glavkosmos, a subsidiary of the Russian State Space Corporation Roscosmos, have signed a memorandum of cooperation in relations to manufacturing and launching of Bangabandhu Satellite-2 Earth observation satellite system.</p>
			<p>Dmitry Loskutov, CEO of Glavkosmos JSC, and Shahjahan Mahmood, chairman and CEO of Bangladesh Satellite Company Limited, signed the memorandum on Wednesday.</p>
			<p>The two sides expressed their intentions to establish partnership relations to develop long-term, effective and mutually beneficial cooperation in the field of promotion of products and services of the Russian space industry in Bangladesh.</p>
			<p>That includes manufacturing and launch of Bangabandhu Satellite-2 Earth observation satellite system, manufacturing of ground infrastructure (satellite ground stations) for acquiring Earth observation data from the Russian and foreign spacecraft, launch services, educational programs in space domains, commercial orbital flights and consulting services, Glavkosmos said, quoting the document.</p>
			<p>The memorandum of cooperation comes into effect from the moment of signing and will be valid until December 31, 2026.</p>
			<p>Glavkosmos&rsquo; main task is to promote the achievements of the Russian rocket and space industry to world markets and to manage complex international projects.</p>
			<p>During its more than thirty-five-year history, the company has successfully fulfilled over 140 international contracts, including the launch of more than 170 spacecraft as a secondary payload.</p>
			<p>Since May 2021, Glavkosmos has been the official operator of Roscosmos trademarks.</p>
			<p>Roscosmos is a state corporation established in August 2015 to carry out a comprehensive reform of the Russian rocket and space industry.</p>
			<p>Bangladesh Satellite Company Limited, a state-owned company, was established to ensure manufacturing, launch, control, marketing and sales of national satellite capacity with satellite ground stations.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2022/02/03/russia-readies-retaliation-against-german-rt-ban/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Russia is set to retaliate against Germany after state broadcaster RT was banned by German authorities.</p>
			<p>The news channel, which is backed by the Russian government and often acts as a mouthpiece for the Kremlin, went off the air within days of its launch in Germany in December. The German-language version of the channel was found not to have the correct licence to operate in the country, and was swiftly removed from the list of channels broadcast by Eutelsat.</p>
			<p>YouTube also removed RT DE in December, stating that it violated community standards.</p>
			<p>This ban was reiterated this week, when the  MABB media watchdog and Commission for Licensing and Supervision (ZAK) said that RT required a licence that conforms with Germany&rsquo;s State Media Treaty. </p>
			<p>RT previously said that the licence it holds in Serbia gives it the right to broadcast in Germany as per the European Convention on Transfrontier Television. It branded the ban as illegal, and announced plans to launch a legal channel.</p>
			<p>Now, Russia is set to announce retaliatory measures against Germany. The response is set to impact German broadcasters and media accredited in Russia. </p>
			<p>In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said: &ldquo;This move deprives us of any choice but to embark on retaliatory measures against German media accredited in Russia, as well as against internet intermediaries that have voluntarily and groundlessly deleted accounts of the TV channel from their platforms.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Tensions between the west and Russia are at the highest point in years, with Russia readying to invade Ukraine under the pretence of defending itself from NATO aggression.<br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/02/03/vevo-launches-on-google-tv-and-android/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Music video network Vevo is bringing the Vevo app to Google TV and other Android TV OS devices.</p>
			<p>Vevo&rsquo;s TV app will be available on Android TV OS devices across the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Mexico, and Brazil, significantly boosting Vevo&rsquo;s global TV footprint.</p>
			<p>Given the popularity of Android TV OS in the Smart TV market, this partnership greatly expands free, on-demand access to Vevo&rsquo;s extensive catalogue of premium music videos, including official releases, live performances, and original Vevo-produced content.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Vevo&rsquo;s mission is to maximise the commercial and promotional value of the music video, an art form that marries sight, sound, and motion and is a key pillar of entertainment,&rdquo; explained Kevin McGurn, president, sales &amp; distribution, Vevo. &ldquo;So, as consumer viewership trends of music videos continue to shift towards Internet-enabled, connected TVs (CTV) in today&rsquo;s world, we continue to expand our distribution to meet consumers in those environments they are actively frequenting. Google is a critical international distribution channel for Vevo, bringing a huge global audience to our content, as we lead the charge in returning music video programming to TV screens at scale.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Music videos are not only insanely popular, but they are powerful and highly-engaging content to advertise against due to the deep emotional connections that they forge with the viewer. They can feel deeply personal, yet have mass appeal. Vevo&rsquo;s app uniquely provides advertisers with the opportunity to appear alongside some of the most cherished and iconic music videos. With support for Android TV OS, brands can access even more inventory and more eyeballs, especially hard-to-reach consumers, such as cord-cutters, cord-nevers, and younger demographics, which do not watch traditional broadcast television,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
			<p>Vevo recently updated its TV app to combine linear programming with search and discovery functions, with the interface reflecting a live TV experience. Videos auto-play upon entering the app, and the more viewers visit, the more personalised the auto-play content recommendations become over time. Vevo&rsquo;s enhanced app is available on Google TV and other Android TV OS devices.<br>

			<p><b><i>Mitsubishi Electric announced for Team AUSSATs Australian Satellite Defence Tender<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.miragenews.com/mitsubishi-electric-announced-for-team-aussats-717683/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Optus announce Mitsubishi Electric has joined Raytheon Australia and Thales Australia for the JP9102 Australia Defence Communication System proposal</p>
			<p>Optus, Australias largest and most experienced satellite owner and operator with over 35 years of experience, have announced Mitsubishi Electric satellites for Team AUSSATs JP9102 Australia Defence Communication System proposal.</p>
			<p>Mitsubishi Electric will manufacture Australias next generation of Defence satellites as part of Team AUSSATs proposal, which already encompasses leading Defence partners Raytheon Australia and Thales Australia.</p>
			<p>Optus and Mitsubishi Electric have a longstanding collaboration, including the highly successful Optus C1 satellite, which currently provides critical mission capabilities to the Australian Defence Force.</p>
			<p>Commenting on the announcement by Team AUSSAT, Optus Chief Executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin said, As a leader in the Australian space sector, Optus is thrilled that we can once again work closely with Mitsubishi Electric, further building on our Optus C1 success, and ensuring the highest design, build and launch standards from Team AUSSAT.</p>
			<p>Our JP9102 proposal draws on the best in breed partnerships with Raytheon Australia, Thales Australia and now Mitsubishi Electric to deliver the ADFs future satellite communications requirements while growing critical skills in the local technology and space sector. With our combined track record of performance successes, our best in class collaboration will deliver an unrivalled satcom solution designed in Australia, by Australians, for Australians.</p>
			<p>Mitsubishi Electrics extensive space experience brings a proven history in supplying more than 70 satellites as a prime contractor and providing onboard equipment for more than 500 spacecraft to customers around the world.</p>
			<p>Working together with Optus has been an enduring partnership providing satellite communication services to the ADF since 2003 said Mitsubishi Electric Australias Managing Director, Jeremy Needham</p>
			<p>We are particularly pleased to have the opportunity to extend this relationship at a time when Australia and Japans defence cooperation has never been stronger. Development of closer space and defence industry ties with Japan and the contribution of Mitsubishi Electric will transform the local industry capability and builds on the almost 50 years of experience that Mitsubishi Electric have, working in Australia, delivering projects here and upskilling our people and partners.</p>
			<p>Established in 1974, Mitsubishi Electric Australia has a long history of assembling, testing and supporting products from its facility at Rydalmere in Sydney. Australian content and a network of local suppliers have been a vital part of the companys success and growth in this market. As their defence business expands, Mitsubishi Electric Australia is already engaging with suppliers, such as indigenous employer Willyama Services, which is providing support in relation to the Defence Industry Security Program (DISP).</p>
			<p>Team AUSSATs unique proposition leverages over 12,000 Australians already employed, and its JP9102 offering will create a unique, highly skilled Australian workforce with unrivalled national space experience, capacity and capability for the future.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.space.com/spacex-launches-nrol-87-spy-satellite-lands-rocket<br>
			</p>
			<p>SpaceX sent a U.S. spy satellite to orbit today (Feb. 2) in the second of three planned launches over a four-day stretch.</p>
			<p>A two-stage Falcon 9 rocket topped with the National Reconnaissance Office's (NRO) NROL-87 payload lifted off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California today at 3:27 p.m. EST (2027 GMT; 12:27 p.m. local California time). </p>
			<p>A little over eight minutes later, the Falcon 9's first stage came back to Earth for a pinpoint touchdown at Vandenberg's Landing Zone 4. The upper stage, meanwhile, continued carrying NROL-87 to orbit.</p>
			<p>It's not clear what the spy satellite will do up there; its activities and instruments are classified, like those of most NRO spacecraft. (The NRO operates the United States' fleet of spy satellites.) Indeed, upon the NRO's request, SpaceX ended today's launch webcast just after the first stage touched down.</p>
			<p>The NROL-87 launch came just two days after SpaceX delivered the Italian CSG-2 Earth-observation satellite to orbit from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. And the company plans to launch 49 of its Starlink internet satellites on Thursday (Feb. 3) from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, which is also on Florida's Space Coast.</p>
			<p>Today's launch was SpaceX's fifth of 2022. The mission marked the company's 143rd orbital launch overall and its 105th booster landing. SpaceX commonly reuses Falcon 9 first stages, as well as those of its Falcon Heavy rocket, as a way to reduce launch costs and boost productivity. But the first stage that helped launch NROL-87 had not flown before, its brand-new status indicated by its clean, unblemished coat of white paint.</p>
			<p>NROL-87 was the NRO's first launch of the year and its first with SpaceX under a $316 million National Security Space Launch contract that was signed in 2020, NRO officials said via Twitter on Tuesday (Feb. 1). It was also the first NRO mission to involve a rocket landing.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.satellitetoday.com/ground-systems/2022/02/02/gilat-unveils-next-generation-vsat-skyedge-iv/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Gilat Satellite Networks debuted its next-generation very small aperture terminal (VSAT) on Wednesday, the SkyEdge IV. The VSAT was designed for the evolving satellite connectivity ecosystem, to work across multiple orbits, with software-defined satellites, with use cases like fixed and mobile connections, 5G, and IoT.  </p>
			<p>The company said it has already secured &ldquo;significant&rdquo; orders for the platform.  </p>
			<p>The SkyEdge IV was designed to support cloud software-defined network infrastructure (NMS). The platform is equipped with Elastix-TotalNMS for network management, and includes the Aquarius family of VSATs with more than 2 Gbps total throughput.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Gilat is bringing to market SkyEdge IV, an unprecedented deep-tech software-centric platform that will make the future multibillion-dollar VHTS [very high throughput satellite] market opportunity a reality,&rdquo; said Hagay Katz, Gilat&rsquo;s chief product and marketing officer.</p>
			<p>The SkyEdge IV is backward-compatible with the SkyEdge II-c VSATs, which have seen wide commercial adoption. Orders for the SkyEdge II-c in recent months including deals for mobile network operators in Asia, a satellite service provider in Eurasia, African backhaul provider Africa Mobile Networks, and Intelsat. <br>

			<p><b><i>Fast Studios to launch Women&rsquo;s Sports Network<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/02/02/fast-studios-to-launch-womens-sports-network/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Fast Studios, the LA-based venture studio, has unveiled its plan to build the Women&rsquo;s Sports Network &#151; a free, ad-supported, 24/7 streaming destination where fans will find 100 per cent women&rsquo;s sports content.</p>
			<p>The Women&rsquo;s Sports Network has confirmed participation from several leading organisations including the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA), US Ski and Snowboard and World Surf League (WSL), in addition to collaborative support from the women&rsquo;s sports media brand GoodSport and Empower Onyx, a minority-owned media company that celebrates the journey of Black women and girls through sports, with more launch partners to follow. The channel&rsquo;s strategy is to be as inclusive as possible with rights holders, athletes and content producers to further raise the profile of women&rsquo;s sports.</p>
			<p>Fast Studios&rsquo; Women&rsquo;s Sports Network Advisory Board includes leaders in women&rsquo;s sports, including Carol Stiff, a 30-year veteran of ESPN and Women&rsquo;s Basketball Hall of Fame inductee who has been instrumental in growing the profile of women&rsquo;s sports media throughout her career; and Sophie Goldschmidt, CEO of US Ski &amp; Snowboard who recently served as CEO of the World Surf League (WSL) and previously held leadership positions with the NBA, Women&rsquo;s Tennis Association, European PGA Tour and Adidas.</p>
			<p>To complement the array of programming from its content partners, Women&rsquo;s Sports Network will produce flagship daily and weekly women&rsquo;s sports news, talk and highlights shows from a new, dedicated studio space in LA. Emmy Award-winning media executive Melissa Forman is advising the channel&rsquo;s original programming strategy.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Women&rsquo;s sports programming has been too hard to find on TV for too long. Brands are telling us that they want to support female athletes, and they appreciate how brand-safe and relatable they are,&rdquo; added Stiff.  &ldquo;When we launch, 50 years after Title IX started the ball rolling towards parity for women&rsquo;s sports in America, the Women&rsquo;s Sports Network will fill a void that has been plaguing brands and audiences alike.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;There is a huge, under-served market for women&rsquo;s sports on television. Currently, female athletes receive only 4 per cent of sports media coverage despite making up 40 per cent of all participants in sports,&rdquo; said Goldschmidt. &ldquo;The new Women&rsquo;s Sports Network is primed for success with our initial slate of content partnerships with key sports organisations, deep relationships with brand marketers, and the growing demand for a premiere destination for women&rsquo;s sports.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;For too long, the women&rsquo;s sports industry has been seen through the lens of men&rsquo;s sports, and that has led to a massive underestimation of the commercial opportunity,&rdquo; added Stuart McLean, CEO of Fast Studios. &ldquo;Our significant investment in the Women&rsquo;s Sports Network, the outstanding team of partners we&rsquo;re continuing to grow, and the cultural forces at play all combine to make this the most exciting new venture I&rsquo;ve ever had the privilege to launch. We are so grateful to have so many visionary women embrace this mission and put their energy and expertise behind this new venture.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Women&rsquo;s Sports Network will debut later this year on free, ad-supported streaming platforms.<br>

			<p><b><i>Telstra plows $1.6B into satellite and fibre projects<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.arnnet.com.au/article/694902/telstra-plows-1-6b-into-satellite-fibre-projects/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Building of Australia's largest fibre network will start in late FY22 and take multiple years.</p>
			<p>Telstra is investing $1.6 billion to lay the ground infrastructure for the &quot;largest-scale&quot; satellite deployment in Australia for communications company Viasat, and building the &quot;largest inter-city fibre network&quot; in the country.</p>
			<p>To deliver both projects, Telstra will invest between $1.4 - $1.6 billion outside of its business-as-usual capital expenditure over the next five years, with up to 70 per cent of its total commitment spread across its T25 planning period. </p>
			<p>Telstra CEO Andy Penn, said the two projects recognised the strength of Telstra&rsquo;s network assets and were part of its T25 InfraCo ambition to deliver profitable growth and value by improving access, utilisation and scale of its infrastructure. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;Investing in these two truly nation-building projects will see us continue to have the largest inter-city fibre network in the country, helping to future proof  Australia&rsquo;s digital economy and further improving connectivity in regional Australia,&rdquo; Penn said. </p>
			<p>The Viasat program will see three ViaSat-3 terabit-class satellites deployed as part of a 16-year contract. Each satellite provides more than 1TB of network capacity to deliver data and video streaming speeds of more than 150Mbps. </p>
			<p>Telstra will co-locate Viasat&rsquo;s satellite access node (SAN) equipment at hundreds of sites across Australia and will build and manage high-speed fibre links to each site. </p>
			<p>The network will connect the SAN sites to multiple redundant data centres that will house the core networking equipment to manage increased data traffic. </p>
			<p>Penn said the Viasat build would be the largest-scale satellite deployment in Australian history. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a clear demonstration of the potential opportunities we have when we combine Telstra&rsquo;s Enterprise customer management and service capabilities with InfraCo&rsquo;s existing infrastructure assets and new build capabilities,&rdquo; he said. </p>
			<p>Viasat president of space and commercial networks Dave Ryan added that leveraging Telstra&rsquo;s existing infrastructure for its ground network means it can cost-effectively optimise its satellite assets and significantly lower its risk of deployment and operations for the ViaSat-3 terabit-class satellite system. </p>
			<p>The new major inter-city fibre project will deliver up to 20,000kms of ultra-high capacity, low-latency fibre, enabling transmission rates of up to 650Gbps. Building will start in late FY22 over multiple years. Early trial and test deployments are already underway. </p>
			<p>Telstra said discussions with key anchor customers for the national fibre network are progressing including global hyperscalers, local telco providers and construction partners. </p>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/chinese-satellite-sj-21-grabbed-and-pulled-another-out-of-its-orbit-report-8005281.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>If the Chinese satellite SJ-21 can grab a dead satellite and move it out of orbit, there is likely little stopping it from doing the same thing to an operational one the military of other countries, including India, depend upon.</p>
			<p>According to Chinese state news outlets, SJ-21 was designed to &ldquo;test and verify space debris mitigation technologies.</p>
			<p>A Chinese satellite was recently observed grabbing another satellite and pulling it out of its normal orbit and into a &ldquo;super-graveyard drift orbit.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The maneuver raises questions about the potential applications of these types of satellites designed to maneuver close to other satellites for inspection or manipulation and adds to growing concerns about China's space programme, reports The Drive.</p>
			<p>On January 22, China&rsquo;s Shijian-21 satellite (SJ-21) disappeared from its regular position in orbit and was then observed executing a &ldquo;large maneuver&rdquo; to bring it closely alongside another satellite, a dead BeiDou Navigation System satellite. SJ-21 then pulled the dead satellite out of its normal geosynchronous orbit and placed it a few hundred miles away in what is known as a graveyard orbit.</p>
			<p>A geosynchronous orbit allows satellites to match Earth's rotation. Located at 35,786 kilometers above the equator, this position is a valuable spot for monitoring weather, communications and surveillance. Distant orbits, on the other hand, are designated for defunct satellites at the end of their lives and are intended to reduce the risk of collision with operational assets.</p>
			<p>SJ-21's unusual maneuver was observed by commercial space awareness firm Exoanalytic Solutions. During a webinar hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) this week, Exoanalytic Solutions&rsquo; Brien Flewelling said the SJ-21 satellite &ldquo;appears to be functioning as a space tug.&rdquo; Space Command did not respond to a request for comment, Breaking Defense reports.</p>
			<p>Also, this isn&rsquo;t the first time SJ-21 has made headlines with its questionable behavior. In November 2021, a month after its launch, an unknown object was seen orbiting alongside it. At the time, Space Force designated the unidentified object as a spent apogee kick motor, but it was also reported that it might have been an experimental payload designed to test the satellite's ability to perform remote operations and manipulate other satellites.</p>
			<p>Read more: China's 'space dream': A Long March to the Moon and beyond</p>
			<p>According to The Drive, the United States Air Force&rsquo;s China Aerospace Studies Institute (CASI) published a report on Shijian-21 last year shortly after its unknown companion appeared. The report notes that &ldquo;Even Chinese media, academics, and bloggers agree with Western analysts that remote proximity operation capabilities and robotic arm technologies are dual-use,&rdquo; meaning they have potential military applications in addition to scientific or utility ones.<br>
				The report mentions unverified claims that SJ-21 might have some form of net used to capture space debris, claims which have also appeared on social media.</p>
			<p>Although according to Chinese state news outlets, SJ-21 was designed to &ldquo;test and verify space debris mitigation technologies,&quot; the maneuver has raised concerns among other nations about these types of satellites and their potential for military use.</p>
			<p>If SJ-21 can grab a dead satellite and move it out of orbit, there is likely little stopping it from doing the same thing to an operational one the military of other countries, including India, depend upon.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Kristal Astro has announced that it is shutting down in Brunei after 22 years in operation. Kristal Astro is Brunei&rsquo;s pay TV service which is a joint venture between Kristal Sdn Bhd and Malaysia&rsquo;s Astro Televsion Network System (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of Astro Malaysia Holdings Sdn Bhd.</p>
			<p>According to its official notice, Kristal Astro will permanently cease operations on the 31st March 2022 at 11:59pm. The statement mentions &ldquo;considering the fast changing technology trends causing huge shifts in consumer preferences towards digital media consumption, we have come to a fork in the road that calls for us to make this difficult decision. We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.&rdquo; The service was launched in Brunei on 24th January 2000 and it uses the same satellite-based set-top-box as Astro Malaysia.</p>
			<p>Existing Kristal Astro customers will lose access to the pay TV service starting from 31st March and they will be contacted by Kristal Astro representatives soon. According to the FAQ, the deposit will be returned back to customers and it may be used to cover any unpaid balances. Customers can choose to receive the refund by cheque or direct transfer to their bank account.</p>
			<p>Customers can appoint a representative to act on their behalf but they must issue an authorisation letter along with a signed photocopy of the owner&rsquo;s IC/passport as well as the original IC/passport of the representative. The refund will be processed with a minimum of 30 working days.</p>

				From https://www.space.com/china-long-march-4c-rocket-launches-radar-satellite<br>
			</p>
			<p>On Tuesday (Jan. 25) China launched the first of a pair of radar satellites that will provide important geological data following earthquakes and landslides.</p>
			<p>A Long March 4C lifted off from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert at 6:44 p.m. EST Jan. 25 (2344 GMT, or 07:44 a.m. local time on Jan. 26).</p>
			<p>Insulation tiles, designed to keep the rocket&rsquo;s hypergolic fuel in the optimal temperature range in the cold desert winter, fell away from the launch vehicle as it climbed into the night sky.</p>
			<p>Video: China launches land observation satellite - See rocket shed tiles in slo-mo!</p>
			<p>On board was the L-SAR 01A satellite, equipped with L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which will be used to monitor the geological environment, landslides and earthquakes. It is in a near-polar orbit of 98 degrees with an altitude of about 373 miles (600 kilometers).</p>
			<p>Radar observations from space have the advantage of being able to see through clouds. L-band is a range of radar wavelengths that are useful for penetrating vegetation, such as forests, and making observations of soil and rocks.</p>
			<p>L-SAR 01 is the first of a group of two satellites. L-SAR 01B will launch at the end of February, according to the China National Space Administration. </p>
			<p>The pair of satellites will fly in formation and provide geological insights after seismic events such as earthquakes, volcanic activity and landslides and aid relief efforts. The satellites will also conduct large-scale topographic surveys.</p>
			<p>The satellite&rsquo;s developer, the state-owned Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology (SAST), stated that the L-SAR 01 satellites will contribute to the realization of global goals such as sustainable development.</p>
			<p>China has increased its launch rate in recent years and launched more than any other country last year with 55 launches. That means there is more pressure on the country's launch centers.</p>
			<p>Zhai Wenjiang, head of the ground station of China's Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert, told Chinese media that the launch center has upgraded its information technologies in the past year. </p>
			<p>&quot;We handled space station missions and satellite launch missions simultaneously last year. Faced with a multitude of launch missions and higher requirements, we spared no efforts to tackle key problems, carried out research and development for information technologies,&quot; Zhai told CCTV+.</p>
			<p>The launch was China&rsquo;s second orbital mission of 2022, following the Jan. 17 launch of the classified Shiyan 13 test satellite. It was the seventh launch of the year globally, following five successful U.S. launches.<br>

			</p>
			<p>HELSINKI &#151; China&rsquo;s Shijian-21 space debris mitigation satellite has docked with a defunct Chinese satellite to drastically alter its geostationary orbit, demonstrating capabilities only previously exhibited by the United States.</p>
			<p>Data and tracking from space monitoring firms show that Shijian-21 has been conducting sophisticated rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) with other objects in and around the geostationary orbit belt since its launch in October last year.</p>
			<p>This activity culminated in Shijian-21 docking with the defunct Beidou-2 G2 navigation satellite and towing it above the crowded belt of geostationary orbit some 36,000 kilometers above the equator. </p>
			<p>In late December, Shijian-21 approached the defunct Beidou-2 G2 navigation satellite, matching its orbit and rendezvousing with, and eventually docking with the spacecraft, a video representation from space situational awareness (SSA) company COMSPOC shows. </p>
			<p>Brien Flewelling of ExoAnalytic Solutions, speaking during a webinar hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and the Secure World Foundation, said that Shijian-21 performed a large burn Jan.22, taking the Beidou-2 G2 satellite 3,000 kilometers above the GEO belt. </p>
			<p>The docking and subsequent engine burn &#151; which was unusually large, taking it beyond the usual &ldquo;graveyard&rdquo; orbit of 300 kilometers above GEO &#151; has effectively moved it out of harm&rsquo;s way.</p>
			<p>Shijian-21 undocked from Beidou-2 G2 on Jan. 26, leaving the defunct satellite in a disposal orbit. Shijian-21 has sincedreturned to GEO, according to newly-released tracking data from U.S. Space Force&rsquo;s 18th Space Control Squadron (SPCS).</p>
			<p>Beidou-2 G2 failed in orbit following its 2009 launch, has been drifting since 2010 and may have partially fragmented at some point.</p>
			<p>Satellites in geostationary orbit match Earth&rsquo;s rotation and thus appear to be fixed over a point on Earth below, making the GEO belt valuable orbital real estate for monitoring weather, communications and surveillance.</p>
			<p>European and American entities are also working on On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (OSAM) capabilities. Space Logistics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, has launched two Mission Extension Vehicles (MEV-1 and MEV-2) and has released footage of rendezvous with target satellites. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;In regards to how one perceives this, it could go either way,&rdquo; says Victoria Samson, Washington Office director at the Secure World Foundation. &ldquo;You could look at China working to develop the capability to remove inactive satellites on orbit as a way in which it is being a responsible space actor and cleaning up debris that it caused. Or you could use the lens that a lot of the US-based China watchers use and say that this could indicate that China is developing an on-orbit offensive capability.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>China describes Shijian-21 as a space debris mitigation satellite. Still, no details of the satellite nor its planned objectives were released by its developer, the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), following its successful launch. The classified nature of the mission suggests it may have at least some military stakeholders or objectives.</p>
			<p>The launch, however, followed the unveiling of a servicing satellite model by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology (SAST) at an airshow a month earlier, described as a space fuel tanker. A model of the spacecraft featured robotic arms which could be used for attaching to another spacecraft. </p>
			<p>On Nov. 1, SPCS cataloged a new object alongside Shijian-21 with the international designator 2021-094C. The object was used for early RPO and inspection tests before Shijian-21 targeted the Beidou satellite, COMSPOC tracking shows.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;One thing that I find helpful here is that the existence of commercial SSA providers has allowed us this level of transparency and the ability to even discuss this capability by the Chinese,&rdquo; says Samson.</p>
			<p>While debris removal and on-orbit servicing to prolong the lives of satellites is becoming a reality, the same activity could be used for military means to disable or otherwise interfere with a satellite. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;I do like the idea of a precedent where countries feel obligated to tow their dead satellites and spent upper stages from the active GEO belt. I just wish China had done this activity with more transparency,&rdquo; says Brian Weeden, director of program planning for the Secure World Foundation. </p>
			<p>Weeden notes that China itself lumped together the MEV-1 with two explicitly military systems, the X-37B and CCS, in its response to United Nations General Assembly resolution 75/36 on threats to space capabilities.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Deliberately blending all these activities together is not helpful, particularly if China itself wants to be doing similar debris removal and satellite servicing activities and have them not immediately judged as suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>USA 270, Chinese Shiyan-12 encounter</p>
			<p>At the same time as orbital servicing and space tug tests, countries are also engaging in increasing counterspace activities. While China is able to conduct precise operations all the way up at GEO with satellites while receiving active signals, the country also has advanced levels of SSA, as evidenced by activity detected during a close encounter of American and Chinese satellites. </p>
			<p>COMSPOC notes that this month USA 270, a U.S. satellite, neared a pair of new Chinese technology test satellites, Shiyan-12 (01) and (02), as it drifted East just below the GEO belt during its operations. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;As you can see, as that [USA 270] satellite gets close, and does a maneuver in the vicinity of these two Chinese satellites, within a matter of two days, the Chinese satellites are on the move,&rdquo; says Jim Cooper, lead for SSA solutions with COMSPOC. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;China has clearly been monitoring this satellite as it approaches; they&rsquo;ve seen what the U.S. has done to maneuver, in a way that potentially could impact their satellites. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;They processed that; they understood it. And they effectively planned and executed a mitigation strategy around that U.S. satellite,&rdquo; Cooper says, seeing both of these satellites leave the area in synchronicity to get away from that U.S. satellite.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re showing here is counterspace technology. So, they&rsquo;re kind of employing a tactic, technique [and] procedure, or TTP, as it&rsquo;s known by the U.S. Department of Defense, and are showing that they&rsquo;ve got the exquisite, timely and responsive SSA to understand events that are unfolding.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>The closest approach between the U.S. and one of the Chinese satellites was around 73 kilometers, according to COMSPOC. Not close enough to threaten a potential collision, but enough for one party to decide if it wanted to leave the vicinity to avoid potential intelligence gathering or other activities by the other.</p>
			<p>Such close approaches are not forbidden by existing space legislation but indicate a context of growing counterspace activity among major space powers.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s happening more frequently,&rdquo; says Cooper. &ldquo;So this is the kind of thing that, going back three years, four years ago, did not happen.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Over the past several years, we are starting to see these types of scenarios play out more where other countries are approaching and trying to do things around other countries&rsquo; satellites. And then we&rsquo;re seeing those other countries&rsquo; satellites react to that situation and do something about it.&rdquo;<br>

			</p>
			<p>Network connections have been restored for ICT service provider WanTok Tonga which now enables users of this mobile app to contact their family and friends in the devastated island kingdom.</p>
			<p>The mobile and banking solutions provider &#150; headquartered in Port Vila, Vanuatu &#150; was able to restore network connectivity on Monday evening.</p>
			<p>So now users can call and text their loved ones in Tonga through the Wantok Mobile App.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are so relieved to have restored connectivity to Tonga, so family and friends can get in touch with their loved ones back home to check in on them,&rdquo; WanTok Tonga Country Manager Dennis Fuapau said in a statement issued from its headquarters yesterday.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been tough for those abroad waiting to hear from their family here in Tonga,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>Mr Fuapau added: &ldquo;To get to this point, there has been incredible support from partners like Spark NZ, Intelsat, the MEIDECC Office, Digicel and TCC, WanTok Pacific and the WanTok Team in Vanuatu. We are so thankful and grateful for their help.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He said the WanTok Tonga Team had also &ldquo;gone above and beyond&rdquo; to ensure connectivity could be established.</p>
			<p>Mr Fuapau has urged those using the services to keep contacts short so that more people are able to check in with family in Tonga.</p>
			<p>He says at present, connectivity is via satellite and bandwidth is limited until the undersea cable was restored.</p>
			<p>The WanTok Mobile App can be downloaded from Google Play or App Store, and it can be used to call and SMS all mobile networks in Tonga.<br>

			<p><b><i>Tonga licenses Kacific for satellite services <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/01/26/tonga-licenses-kacific-for-satellite-services/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Last week, Tonga was dragging its feet in regard to a 15-year licensing agreement reached with Kacific back in 2019. Now, amidst the catastrophic results of the volcano and tsunami, the Tonga government has relented and granted Kacific permission to operate.</p>
			<p>Kacific Broadband Satellites has now been cleared by the Tongan telecommunications regulator to provide services to several telecom operators and service providers within Tonga, making fast high-quality broadband available throughout the Kingdom. The regulator lifted a ban on the use of Kacific&rsquo;s services which Kacific says it understands was imposed due to arbitration proceedings between Kacific and the Tongan government and being heard in a Singapore arbitration court.</p>
			<p>Singapore-based Kacific is now able to provide over 1GBPS of satellite capacity to Tonga, as required. It has been offering this capacity since January 21st, and people are already using the service.</p>
			<p>Bandwidth from Kacific1 can be shared among the telecom operators and service providers, enabling immediate relief to emergency services. The bandwidth can later be redirected and used for a wide range of activities: supporting mobile networks, connecting communities in remote outer islands or providing high-quality internet connectivity to businesses and agencies, says Kacific.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re extremely pleased that we have now been able to resolve the impasse in providing connectivity,&rsquo; says Kacific CEO, Christian Patouraux. &ldquo;We have many friends and partners in Tonga who are aware that we understand and deeply sympathise with the difficulties they have been facing. Their efforts have helped us secure the approvals we needed to provide this essential service.&rdquo;<br>

			<p>JIUQUAN, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- China launched a Long March-4C rocket to place a new satellite in space Wednesday.</p>
			<p>The rocket blasted off at 7:44 a.m. (Beijing Time) at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China and soon sent the L-SAR 01A satellite into preset orbit.</p>
			<p>The satellite, equipped with L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), will be used to monitor the geological environment, landslides and earthquakes.</p>
			<p>The mission marked the 407th flight of the Long March carrier rockets, said the launch center.</p>
			<p>China's L-SAR 01 is a satellite group composed of two satellites (L-SAR 01A and L-SAR 01B), which are designed to be put in an orbit at an altitude of 600 km, according to the China National Space Administration.</p>
			<p>Boasting wide coverage and high spatial resolution, the L-SAR satellite project will help reduce China's dependence on foreign data in fields such as geology, earthquake monitoring and emergency support, said the administration.</p>
			<p>The L-SAR 01B is scheduled to be launched at the end of February. &#x25A0;</p>

			<p><b><i>Disney+ to expand to 42 additional EMEA countries this summer<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2022/01/26/disney-to-expand-to-42-additional-emea-countries-this-summer/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Disney has set out a significant expansion plan for its SVOD service Disney+.</p>
			<p>The company has revealed plans to launch in 42 countries in Europe and MENA this summer, adding to the 18 European markets where it has launched since Disney+&rsquo;s initial rollout in November 2019.</p>
			<p>The full list of new markets for Disney+ includes: Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Bahrain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Iraq,  Israel, Jordan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Malta, Montenegro, Morocco, North Macedonia, Oman,  Palestine Territories, Poland, Qatar, Romania, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Vatican City, and Yemen.</p>
			<p>In addition, Disney+ will launch in 11 new EMEA territories including Faroe Islands, French Polynesia, French Southern Territories, St. Pierre and Miquelon Overseas Collective, &Aring;land Islands, Sint Maarten, Svalbard &amp; Jan Mayen, British Indian Ocean Territory, Gibraltar, Pitcairn Islands, and St Helena.</p>
			<p>Disney did not reveal specific dates for these launches, offering that the streamer will launch in the summer. </p>
			<p>This 42-country launch represents the most significant expansion announcement made by Disney to date, and comes at a time when streaming leader and major rival Netflix is struggling to hit its subscriber targets.</p>
			<p>Elsewhere, Disney has announced the commission of a new series based on the cult-favourite Percy Jackson book franchise, with this eagerly awaited fantasy series serving as a complement to Disney+&rsquo;s regular staple of Marvel- and Star Wars- based shows.<br>

			<p><b><i>BeIN Sports France hails anti-piracy court ruling<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2022/01/26/beiin-sports-france-hails-anti-piracy-court-ruling/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Pay TV outfit beIN Sports France has claimed a significant victory in its fight against illegal theft of content with a court decision requesting the blocking of fraudulent websites previously identified by the channel.</p>
			<p>As part of the ruling by the Paris Court of Justice and in compliance with France&rsquo;s new Article L. 333-10 of the Sports Code, ISPs have moved to block offending sites and addresses.</p>
			<p>New French media regulator Arcom will now have the power to request ISPs to block any new site that illegally retransmits live. This measure aims to significantly reduce the volume of fraudulent signals.</p>
			<p>beIN Sports France is currently broadcasting the extensively pirated TotalEnergy Africa Cup of Nations.</p>
			<p>The Paris ruling follows a similar ruling in Spain earlier this month where Telef&oacute;nica&rsquo;s streaming service Movistar+ and LaLiga secured a Spanish court judgement that they say will oblige internet service providers to take immediate action to block pirate streaming sites.</p>
			<p>Caroline Guenneteau</p>
			<p>As a result of the ruling, LaLiga and Movistar+ will have the right to request the blocking of new domains each week within a given time period without the need to secure an additional specific court ruling. The pair said that this would enable them to act with the speed required to fight agile and dynamic pirate websites.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;beIN Sports welcomes the speed of the procedure and the diligence with which the blocking measures were put in place. This first ever court decision is the culmination of years of work and fight against piracy led by beIN Media Group and beIN Sports France, in order to protect the intellectual property of broadcasters and rights holders, and to preserve the sports ecosystem. It is a concrete sign of the entry into force of the new legal mechanism aimed at simplifying and accelerating the blocking and inaccessibility of fraudulent sites and/or addresses broadcasting illegal content via streaming or IPTV,&rdquo; said Caroline Guenneteau, deputy general secretary of beIN Media Group.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This major step in the history of the fight against piracy marks a symbolic turning point and gives a strong signal to all the players concerned. The objective from now on will be to determine, in consultation with all the stakeholders and Arcom, the modalities that will allow us to optimise, in the coming weeks, the timeframe for the application of blocking measures for identified sites and possible mirror sites.&rdquo;<br>

			<p>Some  bad news , it looks like Freeview on Optus D1/Optus 11 is pretty much a dead option for the future if the news (news section item) is correct and they don't spend the money to upgrade it to HD. Hopefully TVNZ and Discovery will issue a response about what their future plans are.<br>
			</p>
			<p>However of course its possible with the new deal. It would just need some common sense. This is what I would do, <br>
			</p>
			<p>The current setup  <br>
			</p>
			<p>Transponder 12L&nbsp;(12456 H Sr 22500 Fec 3/4 DVB-S &quot;TVNZ&quot; )<br>
				Transponder 12U (12483 H Sr 22500 Fec 3/4 DVB-S &quot;Kordia&quot; )<br>
			</p>
			<p>Would need to change to DVB-S2 (matching to Skys 12519 H Sr 22500 Fec 3/4) and the change from MPG2 to H264 and DVB-S to DVB-S2 would easily give the needed bandwidth<br>
			</p>
			<p>The new 12L would look as follows<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Edge TV (SD) <br>
				HGTV New Zealand (SD)  <br>
				Firstlight (SD)<br>
				Three  (HD)<br>
				Bravo New Zealand (SD) <br>
				Parliament TV (SD)<br>

			</p>
			<p>RNZ National<br>
				RNZ Concert<br>
				Niu FM<br>
				George FM<br>
				Base FM<br>
			</p>
			<p>The new 12U would look as follows<br>
			</p>
			<p>TVNZ Duke  (HD)<br>
				Maori TV  (HD)<br>
				TVNZ 1 Auckland  (HD)<br>
				TVNZ 2 (HD) <br>
				TVNZ 1 Auckland +1 (SD)  <br>
				TVNZ 2 +1  (SD) <br>
				TVNZ 1 Hamilton (SD) <br>
				TVNZ 1 Wellington (SD) <br>
			</p>
			<p>They could consider ditching the regional feeds completely<br>
			</p>
			<p>As for Prime they use Skys transponder and they are already DVB-S2 they would just need switch to H264 from their current MPG2<br>
			</p>
			<p>Their T.P could look as follows<br>
			</p>
			<p>Breeze TV (SD) <br>
				TVNZ Duke +1 (HD) <br>
				Prime Plus 1 (HD) <br>
				Bravo New Zealand +1 (SD)  <br>

			<p><b><i>NBN Co sheds 1200 satellite customers since December<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.itnews.com.au/news/nbn-co-sheds-1200-satellite-customers-since-december-575010<br>
			</p>
			<div align="left">
				<p>Operator says change is mostly 'seasonal'.</p>
				<p>NBN Co lost over 1200 active satellite customers between the start of December and early January, and 1772 customers since its active user base peaked at 112,600 in early September 2021.</p>
				<p>The downward trend is captured in the company&rsquo;s weekly progress reports, which also show that the company is approaching an active satellite user base level that is par with the first quarter of 2021 - about a year ago.</p>
				<p>An NBN Co spokesperson told iTnews that the &ldquo;small decline in Sky Muster active premises is largely seasonal&rdquo; and that the end of Covid-related lockdowns also played a part in this year&rsquo;s numbers.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Historically, we see declines in incremental active premises growth in the Christmas and school holiday period,&rdquo; the spokesperson said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;This is typically followed by an increase as people start returning to work and school in mid-to-late January.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;This is again the case, with a trending up in the last couple of weeks that we expect will be reflected in our future weekly progress reports.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;The end of Covid lockdowns has also had an impact. We saw an increase in take up of the Sky Muster services as stay at home orders were put in place.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Now that these have ended, there has been a small decline in demand as people began returning to school and workplaces.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Previous &ldquo;seasonal&rdquo; declines have been much smaller in size - equivalent to a fraction of a percent of the active user base.</p>
				<p>Over the 2020-21 new year period, for example, NBN Co experienced a brief reduction of 79 active satellite subscribers over a fortnight, before continuing to grow.</p>
				<p>In the 2019-20 year end, the company saw a reduction of 453 subscribers.</p>
				<p>The arrival of competitors such as Starlink may also be a contributing factor to this year's reduction.</p>
				<p>While not yet available in all of Australia, Starlink&rsquo;s early customers report speeds typically in the hundreds of megabits per second.</p>
				<p>NBN Co said in November that it viewed low earth orbit (LEO) satellite operators like Starlink as competitors.</p>
				<p>NBN Co&rsquo;s spokesperson acknowledged the change in the competitive landscape but said the company continued to improve its Sky Muster services.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;NBN Co operates in a commercial environment and we are always working to evolve and invest in the network,&rdquo; the spokesperson said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;We are continually striving to enhance our Sky Muster satellite service product offering and to increase user utility and experience.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;One of the reasons that the NBN was established was to deliver virtually ubiquitous access to reliable, secure, high-speed broadband as quickly as possible and at least cost to taxpayers.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Our priority is to offer the best possible commercially sustainable service that delivers secure, reliable broadband to customers wherever they live and work.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>The company is presently consulting with retail service providers on ways to further improve the Sky Muster Plus product, which unmeters traffic for certain types of web-based applications.</p>
				<p>It is also unclear if any reduction in active Sky Muster users would be a cause for concern, given the satellite network is an unprofitable part of the NBN business, regardless of how many users it has.</p>
				<p>The upgrade path for the satellite portion of the network remains unclear, although the company has previously flagged a number of possible options, including buying capacity from a LEO operator.<br>

			<p><b><i>Freeview satellite customers face another 10 years of SD viewing<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/127587844/freeview-satellite-customers-face-another-10-years-of-sd-viewing<br>
			</p>
			<p>Freeview says the move to HD would be a matter for broadcasters.</p>
			<p>Television viewers who receive free-to-air television from Freeview using a satellite dish will have to continue to make do with standard definition broadcasts, after an opportunity was not taken to upgrade the service to HD.</p>
			<p>State-owned enterprise Kordia announced on Tuesday that it had renewed its satellite agreement with Australian company Optus, ensuring Freeview would be able to continue broadcasting free-to-air channels via satellite for another 10 years.</p>
			<p>Kordia will initially continue to use Optus&rsquo; D1 satellite to broadcast Freeview, before switching to its new Optus 11 satellite in 2024.</p>
			<p>But Kordia said the new deal would not see Freeview get any extra transponder capacity on either satellite and Freeview&rsquo;s service would remain &ldquo;as is&rdquo; in standard definition.</p>
			<p>Former Kordia chief executive Scott Bartlett, who passed away from brain cancer in 2020, said in 2019 that he would be &quot;astounded&quot; if the satellite broadcasts didn't at least go HD when the deal was re-signed, suggesting the question was more whether the service would be upgraded to 4K.</p>
			<p>Freeview is available in HD to the 86 per cent of New Zealanders who can receive its terrestrial service via UHF aerials, and via broadband.</p>
			<p>Sky TV satellite customers are also able to receive TVNZ1, TVNZ2, Three and Prime in HD, as Sky leases more transponder capacity than Freeview on Optus D1.</p>
			<p>Sky said in 2020 that deal would allow it to upgrade at least some of its satellite channels to 4K or 8K formats at any point over the life of its contract with Optus.</p>
			<p>Freeview acting general manager Leon Mead said it was still keen to explore opportunities to upgrade its satellite service to HD, but indicated it came down to the priorities of free-to-air broadcasters.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It is going to come down the broadcasters. The technology exists to do it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>Television channel Three owner Discovery declined to comment. TVNZ has also been approached for comment.</p>
			<p>Kordia head of media Dean Brain said he was disappointed the move to HD had not happened.</p>
			<p>Each channel in HD would require 2&frac12; times the capacity on the satellite of an SD channel, he said.</p>
			<p>Dean said he understood one issue for the broadcasters in deciding whether to contract for the extra satellite capacity was that technology was &ldquo;not moving in the right direction for them&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;There is a concern that there are a lot of Freeview boxes out there that may not have the ability to do it, so people would have to buy new technology.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I think that for them is more of a concern than the actual cost of it.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Kacific satellite delivering 1Gbps to Tonga after dispute &lsquo;resolved&rsquo;<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.capacitymedia.com/articles/3830612/kacific-satellite-delivering-1gbps-to-tonga-after-dispute-resolved<br>
			</p>
			<p>The government of Tonga has temporarily suspended its dispute with satellite company Kacific so that it can provide 1Gbps to the volcano-hit islands.</p>
			<p>Now Singapore-based Kacific says it has restored broadband services to the country, whose subsea cables were broken when the Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha&rsquo;apai volcano erupted on 15 January.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re extremely pleased that we have now been able to resolve the impasse in providing connectivity,&rdquo; said Kacific CEO, Christian Patouraux (pictured).</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We have many friends and partners in Tonga who are aware that we understand and deeply sympathise with the difficulties they have been facing. Their efforts have helped us secure the approvals we needed to provide this essential service.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Capacity reported last week that a US$5.7m dispute between the government of Tonga and satellite company Kacific was delaying moves to provide internet and phone services until the islands&rsquo; subsea cables are restored.</p>
			<p>The government had still not paid Kacific for a 15-year deal, signed three years ago, to provide satellite back-up in just such an eventuality. Kacific said it was &ldquo;standing by&rdquo; to connect the islands and its 105,000 people.</p>
			<p>Since then both Intelsat and SES have reported that they are providing services to Tonga, in association with companies such as Optus, Spark and Telstra, based in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s not yet clear how the Kacific-Tonga dispute has been resolved, though it was Kacific that informed Capacity that it has been able to restore services.</p>
			<p>Someone close to the industry in the region said they were &ldquo;unlikely to be able to provide further information about aspects of this&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>But it seems that Kacific has now been cleared by the Tongan telecommunications regulator to provide services to several telecom operators and service providers within Tonga. Kacific described the move as &ldquo;a breakthrough&rdquo; that took place &ldquo;when the regulator lifted a ban on the use of Kacific&rsquo;s services&rdquo;, that had been imposed &ldquo;due to arbitration proceedings between Kacific and the Tongan government&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>People are already using the 1Gbps service, said the company, via its Kacific1 satellite, with the bandwidth &ldquo;shared among the telecom operators and service providers, enabling immediate relief to emergency services&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Later, the bandwidth can be &ldquo;used for a wide range of activities: supporting mobile networks, connecting communities in remote outer islands or providing high-quality internet connectivity to businesses and agencies&rdquo;.<br>

			<p>Intelsat and Gilat Satellite Networks are expanding their strategic partnership in commercial aviation. Intelsat will use Gilat&rsquo;s SkyEdge II-c system to expand commercial and business aviation services in Asia.</p>
			<p>Intelsat Senior Vice President of Commercial Aviation, Dave Bijur said in the Monday announcement that this collaboration will bring significant revenue growth in in-flight connectivity (IFC) for Intelsat. </p>
			<p>Intelsat has been improving its position in IFC after acquiring Gogo&rsquo;s Commercial Aviation business in 2020. Intelsat recently ordered two new satellites from Thales Alenia Space that will cover Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia for mobility services, including aviation, and cellular backhaul. </p>
			<p>Gilat&rsquo;s SkyEdge II-c VSAT network platform supports multiple applications including in-flight connectivity (IFC), consumer broadband, and cellular backhaul. It is accompanied by the network management system, TotalNMS, which allows for full configuration, control and monitoring of all system elements and remote terminals. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;This network expansion is a testament to the strength of Gilat technology for IFC. The expanded network will address the increased demand for internet connectivity in the commercial and business aviation market on a global scale and, with the current recovery of global aviation, the timing couldn&rsquo;t be better,&rdquo; commented Amir Yafe, vice president of Mobility and Global Accounts at Gilat. </p>
			<p>Gilat has secured a number of orders for the SkyEdge II-c in recent months including deals for mobile network operators in Asia, a satellite service provider in Eurasia, and African backhaul provider Africa Mobile Networks.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/01/24/oneweb-readies-for-australia-launch/<br>
			</p>
			<p>OneWeb has linked with two Australian telecommunications organisations to offer its satellite broadband service.</p>
			<p>The deals will see Vocus and Field Solutions Group (FSG), resell OneWeb&rsquo;s wholesale and retail Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite connectivity services to consumers, governments and enterprises in Australia.</p>
			<p>Vocus was announced as OneWeb&rsquo;s first distribution partner in Australia in December 2021 and says it hopes to launch connectivity to its first commercial clients by mid-2022. While Vocus already has one of the most extensive fiber networks in rural regions in Western Australia and the Northern Territories, the deal with OneWeb will greatly enhance its ability to provide connectivity services to the most remote sites using Vocus fibre as its core backbone and OneWeb LEO in other areas.</p>
			<p>FSG, OneWeb&rsquo;s second Australian distribution partner, is a rural connectivity specialist which started by offering fixed wireless access and National Broadband Network (NBN) services to rural communities across Australia.</p>
			<p>The Australian news comes closely after OneWeb and its Bharti/Hughes colleagues and investors signed similar deals covering India.</p>
			<p>Bharti is a 42.2 percent owner of OneWeb with Eutelsat owning 22.9 percent. The UK government holds a significant stake while SoftBank, Hughes Network Systems and Hanwha Systems are also shareholders<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.intelsat.com/newsroom/intelsat-and-partners-bring-emergency-connectivity-to-tonga/<br>
			</p>
			<p>McLean, Va. &#150; Intelsat, operator of the world&rsquo;s largest integrated satellite and terrestrial network, in cooperation with Telstra and Spark deployed emergency communications services to support humanitarian aid to Tonga and the archipelago for Digicel Tonga and Tonga Communications Corporation.</p>
			<p>The undersea volcano, Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha&rsquo;apai, erupted on Jan. 15, 40 miles north of Tonga&rsquo;s capital, Nuku&rsquo;alofa. The volcanic explosion and subsequent tsunami knocked out the undersea internet cables, disconnecting the region of 100,000 as residents sought higher ground with the onslaught of rising water and dangerously high waves.</p>
			<p>Intelsat is providing space-based broadband connectivity on Horizons 3e and Intelsat 18, while partners, Telstra and Spark, are providing the ground infrastructure, including VSAT hubs at their teleports, uplink, internet access and remote kits.</p>
			<p>The services provided are now fully provisioned expanding broadband and voice services.</p>
			<p>Additionally, Intelsat is providing services in conjunction with Optus to the New Zealand Defence Force, who will provide humanitarian support in Tonga.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Communications infrastructure is essential to assisting the residents, coordinating medical staff and providing supplies, clean food and water and basic human needs,&rdquo; said Intelsat CEO Stephen Spengler. &ldquo;Our hearts go out to the residents of Tonga and all impacted by this devastation, and we&rsquo;re working with our partners to play a role in supporting the community in their time of need.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Intelsat&rsquo;s swift response is a testament to its communications infrastructure over the Pacific Islands, operational efficiencies, and longstanding commitment to serving the region. It is the quintessential demonstration of satellite solutions&rsquo; near-instantaneous communications activation in areas where disasters have crippled terrestrial networks.</p>
			<p>In 2019, Tonga lost internet access for nearly two weeks when a fiber-optic cable was severed. Intelsat played a significant role in restoring the island&rsquo;s restoration connectivity by providing satellite capacity on Horizons 3e and Intelsat18 at that time.</p>

			<p><b><i>PT&amp;T goes nationwide with VSAT<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/01/24/2155896/ptt-goes-nationwide-vsat<br>
			</p>
			<p>MANILA, Philippines &#151; PT&amp;T Corp. is expanding its presence nationwide with the introduction of broadband satellite internet services in partnership with a Singapore-based broadband satellite operator.</p>
			<p>PT&amp;T said it has teamed up with Kacific Broadband Satellites Ltd. to launch a very small aperture terminal or VSAT product.</p>
			<p>The partnership allows the company to offer high-speed satellite internet at a more economical cost than other VSAT technologies.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This further demonstrates our commitment to enable Filipinos everywhere to enrich their lives and connect communities,&rdquo; PT&amp;T senior vice president for sales Ella Mae Ortega said.</p>
			<p>While PT&amp;T is aiming to expand its fiber presence nationwide to help cope with the growing demand and reach more Filipinos, the company said it also recognizes the importance of VSAT to provide fast and reliable internet to the unserved and underserved businesses and sectors that cannot be reached by any wired infrastructure.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted existing inequalities and the widening of the digital divide. As the new normal calls for people to follow social distancing and lockdown protocols, the need for reliable internet that is efficient and sustainable has never been timelier and more important, especially in the remote areas,&rdquo; Ortega said.</p>
			<p>PT&amp;T&rsquo;s broadband satellite internet services are powered by Kacific&rsquo;s high-throughput Ka-band satellite Kacific1, which spans Asia- Pacific.</p>
			<p>The satellite&rsquo;s beams are received by VSATs, which are small, roof-mounted dishes that transmit and receive data, voice, and video signals over a satellite communication network.</p>
			<p>Ka-band technology, according to PT&amp;T, is designed specifically to provide reliable, high-speed broadband internet to rural and remote populations through concentrated spot beams and easy-to-install onsite antennas that are cheaper than larger dishes of other VSAT technologies.</p>
			<p>This technology can serve various industries, as well as residential customers, with a focus on underserved rural and suburban areas, PT&amp;T said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to partner with PT&amp;T in the Philippines, harnessing our existing services and infrastructure to fulfil the growing demand for connectivity. Demand for work-from-home arrangements, e-learning, as well as telehealth services, have all escalated during the COVID-19 pandemic,&rdquo; Kacific chief commercial officer Brandon Seir said.</p>
			<p>Since the launch of the Kacific1 satellite in December 2019, Kacific&rsquo;s operations have scaled rapidly across Asia- Pacific.</p>
			<p>Kacific currently helps address a market of more than 100 million people in 25 countries around the Pacific and Southeast Asia who are unconnected or under-connected to the internet.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;With PT&amp;T&rsquo;s established expertise in the telecommunications industry, the partnership will further strengthen our position as a provider who can seamlessly connect rural enterprise, government and residential customers. We will follow a common goal to deliver affordable internet connectivity nationwide and join the rally in driving digital transformation in the country,&rdquo; Seir said.</p>
			<p>PT&amp;T officially exited from a court-assisted corporate rehabilitation in late 2018, and has since pursued plans to expand and transform into a digital services provider.</p>
			<p>Its business activities are currently categorized into two major segments--connectivity and IT services.</p>
			<p>The company has a network reach of 22,800 fiber kilometers in high-growth areas, covering almost 40 percent of the total Philippine population.</p>
			<p>It holds a 25-year national legislative franchise which allows the company to establish, maintain, and operate both wired and wireless telecommunications systems for domestic and international communication.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/01/24/pakistan-clamps-down-on-starlink-pre-orders/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Pakistan is echoing India in its decision to ban Elon Musk&rsquo;s Starlink from soliciting pre-orders to its broadband-by-satellite system.</p>
			<p>Pakistan&rsquo;s Telecommunication Authority (PTA) announced on January 19th that Starlink had neither applied for, nor obtained, any licence from the PTA to provide Internet services to the country.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The directions came in the wake of reports that Starlink, through its website, is asking intended subscribers to pay a deposit of $99 (refundable) as pre-order for equipment/services,&rdquo; PTA said. &ldquo;PTA has already taken up the matter with Starlink to stop taking pre-order bookings from intended consumers with immediate effect as the Company has not been granted any license for provision of internet services in Pakistan.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Starlink says it has more than 750,000 pre-orders for its system.</p>
			<p>Would-be subscribers in India are now told that Starlink is unavailable pending the issuing of a licence. Starlink has been returning Indian deposits. It is likely that similar advice would be issued to Pakistan-based potential users.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220121005054/en/Spire-and-Dragonfly-Aerospace-Announce-Partnership-to-Support-Australian-Office-of-National-Intelligence<br>
			</p>
			<p>Spire&rsquo;s LEMUR satellite will explore the on-board application of advanced machine learning capabilities</p>
			<p>VIENNA, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Spire Global, Inc. (NYSE: SPIR) (&ldquo;the Company&rdquo; or &ldquo;Spire&rdquo;), a leading provider of space-based data, analytics and space services, today announced a partnership with Dragonfly Aerospace to support the Australian Government&rsquo;s Office of National Intelligence (ONI) with a second satellite as a part of its ongoing National Intelligence Community Satellite (NICSAT) program. The follow-up program, NICSAT2, will see Spire designing, building, and launching the company&rsquo;s Low Earth Multi-Use Receiver (LEMUR), a 6U satellite platform, with the capability of on-board computing and processing of machine learning and artificial intelligence across multi-modal data. Dragonfly Aerospace will provide a high-performance Gecko camera using its proprietary space-proven electronics and ruggedized optics for an easy-to-integrate imaging solution for the satellite.</p>
			<p>    &ldquo;With our continued work on NICSAT2, Spire and Dragonfly Aerospace reaffirm the importance of public-private partnerships for dual-use space technologies.&rdquo;<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Australian National Intelligence Community (NIC) launched the NICSAT program to experiment with commercial satellite technologies, including the on-board application of advanced machine learning capabilities on small satellites, like those manufactured by Spire. In keeping with its predecessor, NICSAT2 will be managed by ONI and focused on the application and utility of miniaturized satellite systems, especially in regard to machine learning. Both programs are unclassified science and technology programs, focused on innovative engineering and research that aim to utilize commercial satellites to improve data collection and analysis.</p>
			<p>With the large influx of data sent to Earth, corporations, governments, and other organizations increasingly need advanced systems and processes to efficiently understand the data received. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted processing within satellites allows operators to unburden ground stations and other infrastructure and focus resources on analyzing mission-critical information in space. ONI recognizes the potential application of semi-supervised or unsupervised learning methods for in orbit autonomous machine learning to, amongst other things, enable autonomous sensor operations, speed analytics and data processing, reduce downlink requirements, and better enable human analysts.</p>
			<p>Spire previously worked on the NICSAT program&rsquo;s first satellite, Djara, last year. The mission focus of Djara is to conduct experiments with systems that enable the on-orbit collection and analysis of data including commercially available sensors and technologies such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Machine Learning systems on a chip. The satellite went from concept to launch in just six months and to full operation in just nine months. Djara collects and processes data on orbit and then leverages Spire&rsquo;s cloud infrastructure to downlink, further process, and analyze data.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The success of Djara and the NICSAT program show the significant value of small satellites for rapid deployment of leading-edge innovations and on-orbit data analysis,&rdquo; said Theresa Condor, Chief Operating Officer at Spire Global. &ldquo;With our continued work on NICSAT2, Spire and Dragonfly Aerospace reaffirm the importance of public-private partnerships for dual-use space technologies.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Dragonfly Aerospace&rsquo;s Gecko camera will elevate the satellite&rsquo;s imaging capabilities and improve the image quality sent back to the ONI,&rdquo; said Bryan Dean, CEO of Dragonfly Aerospace. &ldquo;Spire&rsquo;s proven success with NICSAT made them an ideal partner to continue to support the Australian government and we look forward to working together.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>NICSAT2 was successfully launched aboard the SpaceX Transporter-3 mission on January 12th, 2022. <br>

			</p>
			<p>DistroTV, the independent, free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) platform, has lauched DistroTV Espa&ntilde;ol.</p>
			<p>The new free-to-stream channel bundle features 20+ Spanish-speaking channels and will be available to Spanish speakers in the US, as well as Spanish speakers in Latin America. This comes on the heels of the streaming platform&rsquo;s push to expand its global audience footprint into both territories.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Our mission is to provide free-to-stream content to our growing and increasingly diverse global audience,&rdquo; said Navdeep Saini, co-founder and CEO of DistroScale, parent company of DistroTV. &ldquo;Given the fact that roughly more than 53 million people speak Spanish in the US, we could not be more excited to extend our free-to-stream content to this important, often under-served audience, as well as in Latin America. 2022 is all about breaking ground, and with that, breaking down content barriers so that the most viewers globally can consume content that is thought-provoking, stimulating, inclusive, and enjoyable.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>DistroTV Espa&ntilde;ol brings both Spanish and English speaking channels to new countries, such as Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Bolivia and Ecuador, and expands upon the streaming platform&rsquo;s current Spanish offerings in the US, Canada, and Europe.</p>

				From https://www.zdnet.com/article/digicel-reconnects-tongan-users-via-satellite-to-rest-of-the-world/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Telco handing out free SIMs to let people reconnect.</p>
			<p>Digicel said on Wednesday night it successfully re-established international communication with its Tongan network thanks to a satellite link.</p>
			<p>&quot;We are extremely pleased to inform the people of the Kingdom of Tonga that Digicel international calls service is back up. We gave this work the highest priority and our technical team has had sleepless nights over the past few days in trying to restore vital communication with the world,&quot; said Digicel regional CEO Shally Jannif.</p>
			<p>Jannif added the telco would be handing out free SIMs from Thursday to allow people to reconnect with overseas family and friends.</p>
			<p>On Tuesday, Digicel said its network in Tongatapu was active, but its network would not be fully restored until the subsea cable linking Tonga to Fiji was restored. The repair ship CS Reliance has been tasked with the job and is en-route from Papua New Guinea.</p>
			<p>&quot;A preliminary technical fault investigation has established that there are two separate undersea cable breaks. The first between TCL cable landing station Sopu, Tongatapu, and FINTEL cable landing station in Suva, Fiji,&quot; Digicel said.</p>
			<p>&quot;The international cable break is approximately 37km offshore from Tonga. The second cable break is on the domestic cable which is near the area of the recent volcanic activity.&quot;</p>
			<p>In 2019 after the Tonga cable suffered a pair of cuts and experienced a 12-day outage, the archipelago signed a 15-year deal with Kacific for satellite connectivity.</p>
			<p>However, that contract has never been activated, and now sits in arbitration in Singapore, after Tonga deregistered the government company making the deal, Tonga Satellite Limited, and Kacific was not paid. A recent Tongan Supreme Court decision ordered the company to be relisted on the company register.</p>
			<p>During the case, the Tongan government claimed the deal was unlawful because the company did not have a business licence, was not carrying out business activity, and therefore had to legal basis to operate. The judgment said any unlawful conduct was not on the part of Kacific, and did not make Kacific's claims in Singapore unenforceable.</p>
			<p>&quot;Kacific is willing and able to restore connectivity since a valid and signed agreement exists to that effect between the Government of Tonga and Kacific.&quot; Kacific CEO Christian Patouraux said in a statement issued on Monday.</p>
			<p>&quot;All we need is to activate that service and perform that contract. We are now awaiting instructions. We have one simple message for the Government of Tonga. We can help. Please get in touch.&quot;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.space.com/china-first-rocket-launch-2022-classified<br>
			</p>
			<p>China executed its first launch of 2022 with a classified mission, the Shiyan 13 test satellite.</p>
			<p>The Long March 2D rocket carrying Shiyan 13 launched from the China National Space Administration's (CNSA) northern Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center Tuesday (Jan. 17) at 10:35 a.m. local time (0235 GMT, or 9:35 p.m. EST on Jan. 16)</p>
			<p>The satellite was sent successfully into its &quot;predetermined orbit,&quot; CNSA said in a statement machine-translated from Chinese. The statement added that given low temperatures of minus 37 degrees Celsius (minus 35 Fahrenheit) at the launch site, the launch team added &quot;product sealing measures&quot; to the rocket to assure a safe launch.</p>
			<p>&quot;The Experiment No. 13 satellite is mainly used to carry out space environment detection and related technology experiments,&quot; CNSA added of the mission, saying it plans &quot;more than 40 space launch missions&quot; for 2022. China performed a record-breaking 55 launches in 2021.</p>
			<p>Tracking information later showed that Shiyan-13 is in a near-polar orbit of 99 degrees, ranging between 221 miles and 805 miles (357 km and 1,297 km) above Earth, SpaceNews reported.</p>
			<p>&quot;Shiyan are understood to be a series of test satellites, which first launched in 2004,&quot; SpaceNews added. &quot;China currently has more than ten Shiyan satellites in sun-synchronous and geosynchronous orbits.&quot;</p>
			<p>No other information about Shiyan 13's use or payload has been provided in Chinese state media, although the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the main contractor for China's space program, did note that the rocket used a new 6-foot (2 meters) satellite separation device due to unique requirements of the mission.<br>

			</p>
			<p>China launched a Long March 2D carrier rocket on Monday morning, kicking off the country's space program for 2022.</p>
			<p>The rocket blasted off at 10:35 am at the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in northern China's Shanxi province and soon placed the Shiyan 13 experimental satellite in its preset orbit, China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp said in a statement.</p>
			<p>This was China's first rocket launch of the year and the 406th mission of the Long March rocket family.</p>
			<p>The State-owned space contractor said the mission marked the beginning of its schedule of space missions in 2022, which is expected to include more than 40 launch activities.</p>
			<p>Last year, CASC carried out 48 launch missions with its Long March rockets, which are the nation's pillar space transporters. All the missions were successful, making Long March the world's busiest launch vehicle family last year.</p>
			<p>China conducted a total of 55 orbital launches in 2021, more than any other country. The United States ranked second, with 51 launches during that period.</p>
			<p>Developed by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology, another subsidiary of the company, the Long March 2D has a liftoff weight of 300 metric tons and is capable of transporting multiple satellites to different orbits. It has a carrying capacity of 1.2 tons to typical sun-synchronous orbit with an altitude of 700 kilometers, a space often occupied by weather or remote-sensing satellites.<br>

			</p>
			<p>HGC Global Communications, am ICT service provider and network operator, and Kacific Broadband Satellites Group, a broadband satellite operator that provides high-speed broadband access to Asia Pacific, have collaborated to boost critical connectivity across emerging markets in the Philippines.</p>
			<p>Working together, the two providers say they will offer faster, safer, and more reliable critical infrastructure benefiting the Philippines&rsquo; enterprise users as well as an array of industries including mining, government, banks, financial institutions, schools, health clinics, telemedicine, and remote healthcare which may enter the market for the first time.</p>
			<p>Kacific&rsquo;s geostationary Ka-band satellite, Kacific1, was launched in December 2019 to provide high-speed, reliable broadband connectivity to the underserved rural and suburban communities. HGC has been selected as a partner of choice to host Kacific&rsquo;s IT infrastructure and critical business applications speeding up deployments and upgrades, as well as improving network latency and accelerating times to market-leading standards and upping security systems. HGC will provide the international IP routes to Kacific that subsequently will use this to give internet access across remote, internet deprived areas through Satellite technology where there is a lack of fibre.</p>
			<p>By utilising HGC&rsquo;s ultra-low latency Eyeball-as-a-Service (EaaS) Solution, Kacific will be able to reduce latency times and further deploy innovation breakthroughs on the ground with a new line of high-performance and cost-effective broadband terminals. HGC EaaS has been created to take into consideration regional routing and IP related services, bringing on route diversity that achieves ultra-low-latency times of less than 10 milliseconds and a more robust bandwidth but also offers disaster redundancy preventing profit-hitting downtime.</p>
			<p>Ravindran Mahalingam, HGC&rsquo;s Senior Vice President, International Business, said: &ldquo;The Philippines is undergoing a tremendous shift as its economy converts to digital, and the need for critical digital infrastructure has never been greater than right now. From enterprises to OTTs providing virtual banking, streaming services and more, this is a turning point in the faciliating business&rsquo; digitalisation.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Cliff Tam, HGC&rsquo;s  Senior Vice President, Global Data Strategy of International Business, said: &ldquo;This project is not only remarkable from a technical standpoint from Earth to space and back, but it also has a tremendous philanthropist side to it because we are helping to connect the unconnected across swathes of Southeast Asia that are full of talent but that until now lacked the digital tools to shine. We look forward to continuing working with Kacific as well as all the enterprise/OTT users and other verticals to help them take the first step towards modernsing their operations.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Cyril Annarella, Chief Operations Officer at Kacific, said: &ldquo;Our focus has always been to work in partnership with major international carriers and with strong local partners to complement our satellite assets and advance the global broadband infrastructure. HGC is highly regarded in Asia and the global markets, and is a well-known pioneer in the telecommunication arena. The skills and expertise HGC brings to this project allows us to continuously deliver a world class service to our markets and make a rapid and lasting difference to the people of Southeast Asia.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/SpaceX_launches_2000th_Starlink_satellite_from_Florida_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>SpaceX successfully launched 49 Starlink satellites from Florida on Tuesday evening, bringing the total number of Starlinks launched to over 2,000.</p>
			<p>The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center just after 9 p.m. after it was originally scheduled for 7:04 p.m. EST but was delayed within 15 minutes of the original launch time. Only 1,741 of the broadband Internet communications satellites were still in orbit before the launch, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter.</p>
			<p>That means about 252 of the spacecraft have already deorbited and burned up in the atmosphere, according to calculations by Harvard University astronomer Jonathan McDowell. The first-stage rocket booster on Tuesday's launch has been used nine times before, six of which were also Starlink missions, according to SpaceX.</p>
			<p>SpaceX successfully recovered the booster after launch on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean, making it the second such booster to be flown and recovered 10 times.</p>
			<p>The Starlink network is designed to provide high-speed Internet access to customers in remote areas, but also is available in many major cities.</p>
			<p>But SpaceX eventually wants to deploy thousands more satellites, which has raised concerns about space debris and interruptions to astronomy observations. The satellites can cause streaks of light across images of planets, stars and other space objects.</p>
			<p>SpaceX has made adjustments to make the satellites less visible, including visors that shield the spacecraft from sunlight, but astronomers are still concerned, McDowell said.</p>
			<p>The visors &quot;did make some improvement to the astronomy situation; what isn't clear yet is how bright the new generation&quot; of Starlink satellites are, he said. &quot;Hopefully further observations will tell us that.&quot;</p>
			<p>A new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters on Friday by the American Astronomical Society reported a growing impact of Starlink on astronomy.</p>
			<p>Certain types of observations made at the Palomar Observatory in California had 5,301 streaks from Starlink satellites in them, from November 2019 to September, according to the paper.</p>
			<p>&quot;We find that the number of affected images is increasing with time as SpaceX deploys more satellites,&quot; the authors of the paper said.</p>
			<p>However, they wrote that the science operations that were analyzed &quot;are not yet strongly affected&quot; and that the visors were effective in reducing brightness of the satellites in images.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
			</p>
			<p><b><i>Musk: &ldquo;1469 Starlinks are working&rdquo; <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/01/18/musk-1469-starlinks-are-working/<br>
			</p>
			<p>There are 1469 SpaceX Starlink satellite working correctly, according to Elon Musk. He tweeted that another 272 are moving toward their operational orbits. However, SpaceX has launched a total of 1993, according to Musk, which suggests that 252 satellites are not working or somehow didn&rsquo;t make it to orbit.</p>
			<p>Another 49 craft are scheduled to be launched on January 18th.</p>
			<p>Jonathan McDowell, an acknowledged expert on Musk&rsquo;s launch activity, said that one particular batch of 60 craft launched almost a year ago (officially V1.0-L22) in March 2021 had seen 12 satellites lowered and held at 350 kms altitude and thus suggesting a 20 percent failure rate. He summarises the situation as being perhaps &ldquo;a bad batch?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Musk added that the fleet would soon be activating the inter-satellite laser links on recently launched craft.</p>
			<p>The addition of laser links is important and means that satellites equipped with the technology can by-pass Earth-based gateways and maintain extremely high-speed traffic to and from users. Laser linkages also mean a smoother operation.</p>
			<p>The latest Starlink launches all include satellite equipped with suitable inter-satellite laser links.</p>
			<p>Starlink has said that it now has more than 145,000 customers in 25 countries but a shortage of silicon chip-sets has slowed down the supply of new equipment to would-be consumers.<br>

			<p><b><i>Palomar survey instrument analyzes impact of Starlink satellites<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Palomar_survey_instrument_analyzes_impact_of_Starlink_satellites_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>Since 2019, SpaceX has been launching an increasing number of internet satellites into orbit around Earth. The satellite constellation, called Starlink, now includes nearly 1,800 members orbiting at altitudes of about 550 kilometers. Astronomers have expressed concerns that that these objects, which can appear as streaks in telescope images, could hamper their scientific observations.</p>
			<p>To quantify these effects, a team of researchers studied archival images captured by the National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), an instrument that operates from Caltech's Palomar Observatory near San Diego. ZTF scans the entire night sky every two days, cataloguing cosmic objects that explode, blink, or otherwise change over time.</p>
			<p>This includes everything from supernovae to near-Earth asteroids. The Zwicky team members say they decided to specifically study the effects of Starlink satellites because they currently represent the largest low-Earth orbit, or LEO, constellation, and they have well-characterized orbits.</p>
			<p>The findings, reported in the January 17 issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters, shows 5,301 satellite streaks appear in archival images taken between November 2019 and September 2021. The streaks are most apparent in so-called twilight observations, those taken at dawn or dusk, which are important for finding near-Earth asteroids that appear close to the sun in the sky. ZTF has discovered several asteroids of this nature, including 2020 AV2, the first asteroid spotted with an orbit that fits entirely within the orbit of Venus.</p>
			<p>&quot;In 2019, 0.5 percent of twilight images were affected, and now almost 20 percent are affected,&quot; says Przemek Mroz, study lead author and a former Caltech postdoctoral scholar who is now at the University of Warsaw in Poland.</p>
			<p>In the future, the scientists expect that nearly all of the ZTF images taken during twilight will contain at least one streak, especially after the Starlink constellation reaches 10,000 satellites, a goal SpaceX hopes to reach by 2027.</p>
			<p>&quot;We don't expect Starlink satellites to affect non-twilight images, but if the satellite constellation of other companies goes into higher orbits, this could cause problems for non-twilight observations,&quot; Mroz says.</p>
			<p>Yet despite the increase in image streaks, the new report notes that ZTF science operations have not been strongly affected. Study co-author Tom Prince, the Ira S. Bowen Professor of Physics, Emeritus, at Caltech, says the paper shows a single streak affects less than one-tenth of a percent of the pixels in a ZTF image.</p>
			<p>&quot;There is a small chance that we would miss an asteroid or another event hidden behind a satellite streak, but compared to the impact of weather, such as a cloudy sky, these are rather small effects for ZTF.&quot;</p>
			<p>Prince says that software can be developed to help mitigate potential problems; for example, software could predict the locations of the Starlink satellites and thus help astronomers avoid scheduling an observation when one might be in the field of view. Software can also assess whether a passing satellite may have affected an astronomical observation, which would allow astronomers to mask or otherwise reduce the negative effects of the streaks.</p>
			<p>The new study also looked at the effectiveness of visors on the Starlink satellites, which SpaceX added beginning in 2020 to block sunlight from reaching the spacecraft. According to the ZTF observations, the visors reduce the satellite brightness by a factor of about five. That dims the satellites down to an apparent brightness level of 6.8 magnitude (the brightest stars are first magnitude, and the faintest stars we can see with our eyes are about sixth magnitude).</p>
			<p>This is still not dim enough to meet standards outlined by the Satellite Constellations 1 (SATCON1) workshop in 2020, a gathering sponsored by the NOIRLab (National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory) and the AAS (American Astronomical Society) to bring together astronomers, policymakers, and other experts to discuss the impact of large satellite constellations on astronomy and society. The group called for all LEO satellites to be at seventh magnitude or fainter.</p>
			<p>The study authors also note their study is specific to ZTF. Like ZTF, the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory, under construction in Chile, will also survey the sky nightly, but due to its more sensitive imager, astronomers predict that it may be more negatively affected by satellite streaks than ZTF.<br>

			<p><b><i>UK Government to abolish licence fee in 2027 and cut BBC funding<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2022/01/17/uk-government-to-abolish-licence-fee-in-2027-and-cut-bbc-funding/<br>
			</p>
			<p>UK culture secretary Nadine Dorries has announced plans to abolish the licence fee and freeze funding to the BBC.</p>
			<p>Confirming a story from the Mail on Sunday, the secretary tweeted: &ldquo;This licence fee announcement will be the last. The days of the elderly being threatened with prison sentences and bailiffs knocking on doors, are over. Time now to discuss and debate new ways of funding, supporting and selling great British content.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The BBC&rsquo;s funding model has long been a target of the ruling conservative party, with a review into non-payment announced as one of the first acts of current prime minister Boris Johnson&rsquo;s premiership.</p>
			<p>The plans, which will formally be revealed this week, will see the licence fee remain at &pound;159 until 2024 before rising slightly each year through to 2027 when it will be fully abandoned. Typically the fee would be adjusted due to inflation, but this will not be the case for at least the next two years.</p>
			<p>The licence fee makes up the majority of the BBC&rsquo;s income, and its freezing effectively serves as a funding cut for the pubcaster which is already having to stretch production budgets in order to remain competitive with big-budget content from US powerhouses like Disney and Netflix.</p>
			<p>Alternative funding models could include a universal levy on broadband subscriptions, or a subscription akin to the operation of SVODs.</p>
			<p>Dorries has shown little sympathy to this plight, with the Mail quoting an ally of the secretary as saying: &ldquo;There will be a lot of anguished noises about how it will hit popular programmes, but they can learn to cut waste like any other business. This will be the last BBC licence fee negotiation ever. Work will start next week on a mid-term review to replace the charter with a new funding formula. It&rsquo;s over for the BBC as they know it.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Reacting to the news, a BBC source cited by The Guardian said: &ldquo;There has been similar speculation before. There are very good reasons for investing in what the BBC can do for the British public, and the creative industries and the UK around the world. Anything less than inflation would put unacceptable pressure on the BBC finances after years of cuts.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Critics have argued that the announcement from Dorries &#150; a staunch defender of the embattled prime minister &#150; has been made to distract from a litany of scandals and calls for Johnson&rsquo;s resignation.</p>
			<p>Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey has echoed this sentiment, saying: &ldquo;Slashing the funding of a beloved national treasure just because you don&rsquo;t like the headlines on the 6 o&rsquo;clock news is no way for a responsible government in a democracy to behave.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>New space tracking ground station for WA<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spatialsource.com.au/new-space-tracking-ground-station-for-wa/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) has announced that it will soon activate a new ground station in Western Australia, capable of generating highly sophisticated space situational awareness (SSA) data for its future customers and partners.</p>
			<p>The station is to be located at the Western Australia Space Centre, 400 kilometres north-east of Perth.</p>
			<p>The new station is a part of SSC&rsquo;s program to contribute to both safer and more sustainable use of near-Earth space as number of objects keeps increasing at a rapid pace.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are working diligently to deliver data and develop services to help satellite owners operate their assets as safely and securely as possible,&rdquo; said Jacob Ask, SSC Program Manager.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The current number of satellites in space will increase considerably in the future. As the near-Earth space becomes more and more crowded, the need for more precise data will keep growing.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Development of the station began in mid-2020. It features telescopes which will be remotely controlled from the SSC head office in Solna in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
			<p>The telescopes and cameras will be used for detecting and tracking satellites and space debris, collecting valuable information for the management of space traffic in orbit.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;After the installation we will engage heavily in joint observation campaigns with our partners, data fusion, data sharing activities and more. We look forward to contribute to a safer environment in space for the benefit of the development of life on Earth,&rdquo; said Ask.</p>
			<p>The new station is expected to be in operation by mid-2022.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/SpaceX_launches_105_satellites_from_Florida_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>SpaceX successfully launched 105 satellites from Florida on Thursday morning as part of its rideshare program, which it uses to release satellites for dozens of customers in a single mission.</p>
			<p>The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off into blue sky on the Transporter-3 mission as planned at 10:25 a.m. EST from Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station near Kennedy Space Center.</p>
			<p>&quot;Alright, as you can see Falcon 9 has cleared the tower, lifted off from Cape Canaveral,&quot; SpaceX engineer Kate Tice said during a live broadcast.</p>
			<p>Many of the spacecraft on board were no bigger than a shoebox as satellites, like phones and desktop computers, use more miniaturized components.</p>
			<p>The spacecraft flew together into orbit for about an hour, after which clusters of satellites were released periodically over about 30 minutes. SpaceX confirmed successful deployment of all but two spacecraft and said it would attempt to confirm the final two this afternoon.</p>
			<p>The launch is the third in SpaceX's Transporter rideshare program that began in January 2021.</p>
			<p>&quot;SpaceX is targeting at least three dedicated rideshare flights to sun synchronous orbit per year,&quot; Tice said. &quot;And we also offer opportunities for a ride to orbit on our Starlink missions which launch every couple of weeks.&quot;</p>
			<p>The first-stage booster flew for the tenth time and returned to a landing pad about 10 miles away from the launch site within nine minutes of liftoff. SpaceX expected that booster to create a sonic boom heard throughout the region.</p>
			<p>One company on board, Madrid-based FOSSA Systems, specializes in tiny satellites for so-called &quot;Internet of Things&quot; (IoT) communication. For example, such a service might connect devices like keychains to the Internet, so customers can find their keys.</p>
			<p>FOSSA posted about the launch Wednesday on Twitter: &quot;The countdown for the deployment of our first 6 FOSSASAT-2E IoT has started! Tomorrow, January 13, the launch of our first 6 picosatellites will take place with our partners... also demonstrating our PocketPod deployer and launches to LEO for PocketQubes.&quot;</p>
			<p>The company's deployer could be used to distribute other types of satellites in the future, according to FOSSA.</p>
			<p>Additional customers Thursday included San Francisco-based Planet, which saw 44 of its small SuperDove spacecraft launched for Earth observation, and the Ukrainian government, which also launched an Earth observation satellite.<br>

				From https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2022/01/13/satellite-technology-to-boost-communication-systems-during-disasters-says-d/2034755<br>
			</p>
			<p>KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 13 &#151; The Ministry of Communications and Multimedia (KKMM) is planning to use satellite technology to improve communication systems in the face of disasters, said its Deputy Minister Datuk Zahidi Zainul Abidin.</p>
			<p>He said this improvement was to prevent telecommunication network disruptions during disasters, such as the situation experienced during the massive floods that hit the country last month.</p>
			<p>He said the use of satellite technology, including 5G network satellites, could help to manage natural disaster situations such as sending early warnings to the public.</p>
			<p>He said during flooding, communications were disrupted as calls could not be made due to power failures affecting telecommunication towers.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The solution is, we need (to use) satellite...the government will discuss with countries that have (satellite technology) including 5G satellites. This is KKMM's plan,&quot; he said, adding the cost of using satellite technology was lower and the time to implement it was also shorter.</p>
			<p>He told reporters this after attending the Umno Supreme Council meeting at Menara Dato Onn, here last night. &#151; Bernama<br>

			</p>
			<p>Three years ago, the orbital cluster embraced 88 such satellites</p>
			<p>MOSCOW, January 13. /TASS/. The Russian orbital cluster of socio-economic, research, and dual-purpose satellites has grown to over 100 space vehicles over three years, Head of the State Space Corporation Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin said in a presentation released on Thursday.</p>
			<p>As the materials suggest, the orbital constellation of socio-economic, research, and dual-purpose satellites comprised 102 space vehicles as of January 1, 2022. Three years ago, the orbital cluster embraced 88 such satellites, the presentation says.</p>
			<p>Specifically, the Russian orbital cluster comprises 25 navigational, 42 communications, broadcasting and retransmission, and two fundamental space research satellites. Also, the orbital constellation is made up of Earth&rsquo;s remote sensing and manned space program satellites (as part of the International Space Station), according to the presentation.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.nationalfisherman.com/boats-gear/arctic-payload-satellite-comms-are-primed-for-northern-climes<br>
			</p>
			<p>The GX5 is geostationary, staying above the same terrestrial region at all times &#151; like all Inmarsat satellites. But that will change with he company&rsquo;s launch of the GX10s and a constellation of LEO satellites.<br>
				Inmarsat is primed to meet demand for seamless satellite coverage in the far northern latitudes</p>
			<p>Satellite communications usage is increasing steadily across marine industries including the commercial fishing industry. &ldquo;We have seen usage increase 70 percent in the last year, and that doesn&rsquo;t show and signs of slowing down,&rdquo; says Eric Griffin, vice president of Offshore Energy and Fishing, at the Maritime Division of Inmarsat. &ldquo;If anything, it&rsquo;s going to be increasing.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>To meet the projected demand, Inmarsat launched a new satellite in December 2021, with a companion due in 2022. &ldquo;We just launched a satellite before Christmas,&rdquo; says Jonathan Sinnatt, director of communications at Inmarsat. &ldquo;The I-6 F-1, and another going up later this year. Each of those will have more capacity than all out previous satellites combined. &ldquo;Then in 2023 we have the GX7 GX8 and GX9, going up, along with our GX10a and 10b.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Inmarsat&rsquo;s GX10a and 10b payloads will be aboard two American made, Northrup Grumman satellites being launched by Space Norway. Unlike Inmarsat&rsquo;s constellation of geostationary satellites, the GX10 payloads will be in highly elliptical orbit (HEO) above the Arctic.<br>
				The current and projected network of geostationary satellites, as well as the GX10a and GX10b in highly elliptical orbit.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Our geostationary satellites give global coverage,&rdquo; says Sinnatt. &ldquo;But as you get closer to the poles, the angle becomes more acute and the coverage is not as good. The GX10 payloads will be on two satellites in a highly elliptical orbit, which will take them high over the North Pole and then down very fast around the South Pole. With two of them you will always have coverage over the Arctic.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Sinnatt points out that while the GX10 payloads will not be on Inmarsat satellites, they will still connect seamlessly to the Global Express Network. &ldquo;So, from a customer&rsquo;s point of view, you could be in the middle of the Atlantic and then sail north to the Arctic and not see any difference in service,&rdquo; he says.</p>
			<p>According to the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center, Arctic ice cover has been shrinking steadily for decades, resulting in a dramatic drop in the last 40 years from historical averages over the past centuries.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Based on the linear trend, since 1979, December has seen a loss of 1.88 million square kilometers (726,000 square miles). This is equivalent to about three times the size of Texas,&rdquo; says the organization&rsquo;s website.</p>
			<p>One group of researchers from Alaska and Norway predicts that while cod and pollock are unlikely to expand into the Arctic, several species, including Bering flounder and snow crab, have a high potential to move into the northernmost ocean.</p>
			<p>According to Inmarsat&rsquo;s Eric Griffin, the company is actively selling its expanding services to Alaska fishermen. &ldquo;And not just the factory trawlers,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We are talking to crabbers as well, including Jake Anderson of &lsquo;Deadliest Catch,&rsquo; and we&rsquo;re talking to multinationals like Clearwater.&rdquo;<br>
				Based in Houston, Eric Griffin is Inmarsat&rsquo;s fisheries man, responding to the needs of a fleet that will need coverage at high latitudes, and the bandwidth for crew and increasingly digitalized operations.</p>
			<p>Its imminent Arctic coverage is just part of Inmarsat&rsquo;s investment in creating a seamless global coverage system called Orchestra, which will include land-based 5G coverage and a new constellation of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;All of this is backward compatible,&rdquo; says Jonathan Sinnatt. &ldquo;So if you invested in our system in 2016, you don&rsquo;t have to buy new hardware.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Sinnatt points out that customer demand is guiding the company&rsquo;s investment strategy.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The arctic is opening up,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we went in with Space Norway &#151; so that when the demand hits, the capacity is already there to meet it.&rdquo; That demand is not just for access in remote areas, Sinnatt notes, it is demand for crew connectivity, engines diagnostics and increasing internet of things requirements that are part of a digitalization of operations in all marine industries.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Operational efficiency is of vital importance and a big reason to bring Global Express aboard,&rdquo; says Sinnatt.</p>
			<p>According to Griffin, Inmarsat is offering more than satellite service, but also a path to technological advancement. &ldquo;Customers can leverage our systems in order to grow,&rdquo; he says.<br>

			<p><b><i>Starlink takes on NBN to improve Australian farming<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://independentaustralia.net/business/business-display/starlink-takes-on-nbn-to-improve-australian-farming,15925<br>
			</p>
			<p>Elon Musk's Starlink satellites will provide an upgraded level of connectivity to Australia's farms (Image by Dan Jensen)</p>
			<p>With the NBN rollout failing to provide adequate connectivity to rural Australia, satellite broadband is about to make a difference. Paul Budde reports.</p>
			<p>LAST YEAR, I reported on the possibility that LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite-based systems might be a gamechanger for the delivery of high-speed data services, including internet access, to people in regional and remote Australia.</p>
			<p>What has become clear with the rollout of the NBN is that the quality of data connections in metropolitan cities in many cases has improved, but that the rest of Australia doesn&rsquo;t have a similar experience. They depend on fixed-wireless access or the NBN satellites, the quality of these services is in most cases significantly worse than elsewhere.</p>
			<p>I also reported on the sophisticated farming communities that are spread out across the country. They are among the most efficient and effective farmers to be found anywhere in the world. These professionals and farming businesses heavily depend on digital technologies. They need to connect to animals, crops, databases, trading systems, weather and environmental sensors &#151; so the list goes on. They are clearly left behind in relation to connectivity.</p>
			<p>Government failing in regional telecommunications</p>
			<p>The Federal Government has dropped the ball when it comes to NBN and mobile communications in regional Australia.</p>
			<p>Combining these two issues, new satellite-based communication systems and a sophisticated farming community, Connected Farms Pty Ltd, an Australian licenced telecommunications carrier, has engaged Starlink, an Elon Musk SpaceX company, for a commercial pilot of Starlink&rsquo;s mobile backhaul services.</p>
			<p>Many farms and orchards are in areas where there is no cost effective traditional backhaul, to support mobile connectivity. This pilot with Starlink means that the company can offer affordable mobile coverage to more farmers in regional Australia.</p>
			<p>The pilot will cover a range of existing and new customers of the company in regional Australia and New Zealand, providing mobile connectivity through their FarmHub installations across different farm types and geographic locations. Connected farms will be amongst the first carriers worldwide to commercially use Starlink&rsquo;s mobile backhaul services and will install equipment in early 2022. </p>
			<p>A successful pilot will lead to significant numbers of Connected Farms&rsquo; FarmHub installations having their backhaul delivered using Starlink&rsquo;s mobile backhaul services.</p>
			<p>The farm hubs can be configurated for narrowband and broadband applications. They support Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure to capture data from sensors that transmit smaller amounts of data, such as soil probes, water infrastructure monitoring, farm management devices and lower-level robotic functions. </p>
			<p>Labor&rsquo;s NBN plan to reach 8 million households</p>
			<p>It seems Labor has bitten the bullet and decided that to have an overall better quality NBN, more money is needed to upgrade the Fibre-to-the-Node (FttN) to full-fibre.</p>
			<p>True high speed mobile broadband (private LTE) can be provided for connectivity solution across the farm, fence to fence. This enables all levels of agtech and autonomous smart farming applications across farm operations. In addition to operational farm needs, it can also provide connectivity to the farmhouse, farm office and outlying sheds on the property. This solution also enables voice and mobile data uses as well as data intensive and more intensive precision farming functions.</p>
			<p>For farms in an area that lacks connectivity, a Connected Farms Precinct can offer farming collectives the opportunity to achieve wide area mobile broadband coverage over their combined land areas. With all the above-mentioned functionalities. </p>
			<p>What has been lacking in regional Australia are genuinely high speeds and low latency. LEO constellations such as SpaceX&rsquo;s Starlink system can combine the best of both options &#151; delivering extremely low latency and ultra-high bandwidth connectivity at a competitive price point. </p>
			<p>The new satellite system promises to improve on that. It is still early days for Starlink and it still needs to launch many more satellites in order to provide a consistent quality of service across the various regions &#151; as a matter of fact, across the world.</p>
			<p>The services offered by Connected Farms will be like Starlink&rsquo;s residential service, however the Starlink mobile backhaul service has been specifically developed for use in mobile type networks, so the connectivity can be used where it is often most needed over the farmland rather than just at the farmhouse or the office. </p>
			<p>LEO satellites are key to providing cost effective backhaul for remote and regional communities, for farms and other regional precincts. I agree with the company that it is important to use proper commercial grade solutions like Starlink&rsquo;s mobile backhaul rather than ad hoc adaptation of residential service offerings that do not have the same network support or service support levels.<br>

				From https://www.crn.com.au/news/vocus-fsg-sign-as-aussie-distributors-of-oneweb-low-earth-orbit-satellite-services-574570<br>
			</p>
			<p>Australian telco firms Vocus and Field Solutions Holdings (FSG) have secured distribution deals with global satellite internet broadband company OneWeb for its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite services.</p>
			<p>UK-headquartered OneWeb plans to launch a network of some 650 LEO satellites to power its broadband internet services globally, particularly in rural and remote areas. The company has since sent out 394 satellites in orbit as of December 2021.</p>
			<p>Vocus was OneWeb&rsquo;s first distribution partner in Australia, announced on 20 December 2021, followed by FSG announced earlier this week.</p>
			<p>Vocus said the satellite services would augment its own GEO satellite and microwave connectivity offerings, aiming to cover various industries across Australia, including government, mining, oil and gas, utilities, construction and community services.</p>
			<p>OneWeb chief executive Neil Masterson said the Vocus partnership was &ldquo;a truly historic moment&rdquo; for OneWeb.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is the culmination of months of positive momentum with over 50% of our constellation in the sky, increased investment from our global partners, and the rapid onboarding of new customers. We are incredibly excited to start delivering high-speed, low-latency connectivity, first in the Arctic region, and soon across Australia and the Asia Pacific,&rdquo; Masterson said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Thanks to the Vocus team who have joined us on this journey and are instrumental to making OneWeb&rsquo;s mission a success.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>FSG said the deal would bolster its regional and rural connectivity offerings, targeting government, enterprise, agribusiness, mining and resources customers. The company is also set to start trials in Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
			<p>OneWeb regional director for Asia-Pacific David Thorn said of FSG&rsquo;s partnership, &ldquo;OneWeb&rsquo;s enterprise-grade network has a unique capability to serve hard-to-reach businesses and communities. Our work with FSG will focus on how satellite technology can support improved capacity and coverage in remote, rural, and challenging geographic locations.&rdquo;</p>

			</p>
			<p>The Home of Rugby, Stan Sport, has secured the rights to more world-class international Rugby, representing a continued expansion to Stan Sport&rsquo;s Rugby offering that will deliver fans the biggest and best matches all year long.</p>
			<p>Following a ground-breaking launch of Rugby in 2021, Stan Sport has kicked-off 2022 with news that it has secured even more Test rugby with exclusive multi-year rights to the world&rsquo;s oldest international tournament, the Guinness Six Nations Rugby Championship &#150; bringing every match ad-free, live and on-demand only on Stan Sport.</p>
			<p>The opening round of the Guinness Six Nations Rugby Championship will launch on Sunday 6 February 2022, kicking off fifteen matches played over five rounds contested between Ireland, Wales, Scotland, England, France, and Italy throughout February and March 2022. Stan Sport will also be the exclusive home of the Women&rsquo;s Six Nations Rugby Championship and the Men&rsquo;s Under 20s tournament.</p>
			<p>The Six Nations Championships will kick off a massive year of international rugby on Stan Sport in 2022 with series between Australia v England, New Zealand v Ireland, South Africa v Wales and Argentina v Scotland taking place mid-year, followed by the highly anticipated Bledisloe Cup, The Rugby Championship and the end of season Autumn Nations Series including the Wallabies, All Blacks and Springboks Spring Tours &#150; with every match streaming live, ad-free and on demand on Stan Sport.</p>
			<p>Stan Director of Sport Ben Kimber said:<br>
				&ldquo;This is a huge addition to Stan Sport, enhancing our rugby line-up with the crown jewel of the northern hemisphere game. The Six Nations Championships deliver an epic competition each and every year, and as a bonus this season we&rsquo;ll get a great look at Eddie Jones&rsquo; England team in action before they arrive to face the Wallabies on Stan Sport in July.&rdquo;<br>
				Stan Sport is the home of Rugby with exclusive rights to the Guinness Six Nations.<br>

			<p><b><i>Stan launches pay-per-view Event offering<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/stan-launches-pay-per-view-event-offering-20220113-p59nvy<br>
			</p>
			<p>Stan is pushing further into the territory traditionally held by rival Foxtel with the launch of Stan Event, a pay-per-view offering designed to increase the streaming platform&rsquo;s subscriber base.</p>
			<p>Stan will kick off its new offering on March 23 with the boxing heavyweight clash Turf War as former All Black and NRL star Sonny Bill Williams takes on ex-Sydney Swans AFL star Barry Hall.</p>
			<p>Sonny Bill Williams will take on Barry Hall in Stan&rsquo;s first pay-per-view event. Stan</p>
			<p>Stan&rsquo;s push into pay-per-view events will be a blow to Foxtel&rsquo;s Main Event channel, which has positioned itself as Australia&rsquo;s only pay-per-view channel to date and has relied largely on events such as boxing to lure audiences.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This announcement highlights another major milestone for Stan, with Turf War set to be one of Australia&rsquo;s biggest sporting spectacles in 2022,&rdquo; said Stan acting chief executive Martin Kugeler.</p>
			<p>Any Stan customer will be able to purchase Turf War for $50. Foxtel&rsquo;s Main event is charging $54.95 for its upcoming UFC fight in which Francis Ngannou will defend his crown against Ciryl Gane, which can be viewed either through Foxtel or its sport streaming player Kayo.</p>
			<p>Williams and Hall will battle it out for the Turf War honours over 10 three-minute rounds. The pay-per-view event will also be available to stream in venues throughout Australia through the Stan Sport Venues offering.</p>
			<p>Stan launched Stan Sport as a $10 add-on in February last year. Parent company Nine Entertainment (the owner of this masthead) noted at the company&rsquo;s full-year financial results in August that it had attracted 250,000 active subscribers, with Stan overall sitting at 2.4 million active subscribers.</p>
			<p>Market &lsquo;misunderstanding&rsquo;</p>
			<p>Stan Event is designed to bring in new subscribers and increase the platform&rsquo;s average revenue per user (ARPU), which is often used as a metric of success because it is an indicator of the profitability of a product based on the amount of money generated from each of its subscribers.</p>
			<p>In August, Nine was criticised for failing to sell the investor market on the revenue benefits of sinking more money into Stan Sport, with Nine&rsquo;s share price dropping 10 per cent despite delivering a $184 million full-year net profit.</p>
			<p>At the company&rsquo;s AGM in November, Nine chairman Peter Costello conceded the company had failed to hit the mark on selling its investment in Stan Sport and acknowledged that there was a misunderstanding in the market that Stan was not going to be as profitable.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Your profit will fall in the short term, but your revenues will build in the longer term. We got a bit misunderstood on that,&rdquo; Mr Costello told reporters after the AGM.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You can look at these things either way and say we were misunderstood or we didn&rsquo;t explain it properly, but I think the market understands now where we were going.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Stan Sport now boasts rights to the UEFA Champions League, rugby union, the tennis and some motorsport.<br>
				Optus has dug deep into its pockets to retain the English Premier League as sports rights holders look set to be in the power seat as sports streaming comes of age.</p>
			<p>The new broadcast deal will give Nine three additional matches across the season, resulting in more NRL on free-to-air TV, plus new digital rights to allow for matches to be streamed on 9Now.</p>
			<p>Australia&rsquo;s sports streaming sector is becoming increasingly competitive, with Viacom-CBS-owned Paramount+ snapping up rights for various soccer competitions, Optus Sport spending big money on the English Premier League and Foxtel&rsquo;s Kayo focused on success as the group eyes a run at the ASX.</p>
			<p>Stan&rsquo;s Mr Kugeler is fast approaching his one-year anniversary in the acting CEO role, having been elevated to the position when former boss Mike Sneesby became CEO of Nine in March last year.</p>
			<p>Mr Sneesby has repeatedly declined to outline a time frame for a permanent replacement.<br>

They will join two Airbus constructed software-defined satellites, Intelsat 42 (IS-42) and Intelsat 43 (IS-43).</p>
			<p>Intelsat 41 and Intelsat 44 will be based on the Thales Alenia Space&rsquo;s Space Inspire product line allowing seamless telecommunications mission and services reconfiguration, instant in-orbit adjustment to broadband connectivity demand, and superior video broadcasting performance while maximising the effective use of the satellite resources.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Intelsat&rsquo;s standards-based, open-architecture network design facilitates the incorporation of the best technology at any given time, further bolstering network resiliency,&rdquo; said Stephen Spengler, CEO of Intelsat. &ldquo;With the addition of Intelsat 41 and Intelsat 44, in partnership with Thales Alenia Space, Intelsat will blanket the earth with software-defined satellites, progressing the world&rsquo;s first global 5G software-defined network, designed to unify the global telecoms ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The contract enables the continued advancement of Intelsat&rsquo;s planned global software-defined satellite-based network, adding high-speed dynamically-allocated connectivity across Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia for commercial and government mobility services and cellular backhaul.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Our relationship with Intelsat has been so meaningful knowing that our attractive Space Inspire software-defined solution will contribute to the realisation of Intelsat&rsquo;s global 5G software-defined unified network, said Herv&eacute; Derrey, CEO of Thales Alenia Space. &ldquo;We are proud that our advanced satellite technology will play a significant role in Intelsat&rsquo;s vision to reimagine the global telecoms ecosystem.&rdquo;<br>

			</p>
			<p>Hong Kong&rsquo;s PPLive Sports TV streaming service has been ordered to pay the English Premier League (EPL) at least $212 million (&euro;186.5m) by a London High Court judge.</p>
			<p>PPLive signed a deal with the the EPL to show both live and delayed football matches and game highlights throughout China. The deal was set to run for three seasons starting in 2019-220. However, EPL bosses terminated the agreement in September 2020 and said they were owed two instalments from PPLive &#150; who failed to honour payments amid the global outbreak of coronavirus.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In many commercial contracts events may transpire other than as anticipated by one, or even both, contracting parties,&rdquo; said Justice Peter Fraser. &ldquo;That does not mean that the court will rewrite the parties&rsquo; bargain and impose different terms upon them to suit those later events. That is not the function of the law of contract.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The judge ruled that the EPL would receive $210 million plus $2.67 million costs.</p>

			<p><b><i>Inmarsat launches its first hybrid L- and Ka-band communications satellite<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.worldoil.com/news/2022/1/11/inmarsat-launches-its-first-hybrid-l-and-ka-band-communications-satellite<br>
			</p>
			<p>Inmarsat, a leader in global, mobile satellite communications confirmed the successful launch of its first Inmarsat-6 satellite, I-6 F1, by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) from the JAXA Tanegashima Space Center in Japan.</p>
			<p>The Inmarsat-6s (I-6) are Inmarsat&rsquo;s first ever hybrid L- and Ka-band satellites, incorporating increased capacity and new technological advances for ELERA&rsquo;s transformational L-band services alongside additional Global Xpress (GX) high-speed broadband capacity. Adding to an existing global fleet of 14 geostationary satellites they extend Inmarsat&rsquo;s commitment to mission critical services while enabling a new generation of pioneering technologies to connect and sustain the world. This launch is the first of seven planned for Inmarsat by 2024 in the company&rsquo;s fully-funded technology roadmap.</p>
			<p>Launch success was confirmed by MHI at 15:59 UK time on 22 December following satellite separation from the H-IIA launch vehicle, with successful signal acquisition soon afterwards.</p>
			<p>The most sophisticated commercial communications satellite ever launched, I-6 F1 is comparable in size to a London double-decker bus, with a deployed solar arrays &lsquo;wingspan&rsquo; similar to a Boeing 767 and a 9 meter wide L-band reflector that will be deployed over the coming days. The satellite will then be raised to geostationary orbit (GEO) approximately 36,000km (~22,500 miles) above the Earth via its all-electric propulsion system and then undergo a thorough and extensive testing programme. I-6 F1 will enter service in 2023. Ground stations in Western Australia will support I-6 F1.</p>
			<p>Rajeev Suri, CEO of Inmarsat, said &ldquo;This launch marks Inmarsat&rsquo;s newest technological leap forward as we maintain our strong commercial momentum and sector leadership. It gives me great pleasure and pride to confirm the successful launch of I-6 F1. This satellite extends our world leading mobile satellite communications services for our customers and partners, especially in the Indo Pacific region. My warmest thanks and congratulations go to the Inmarsat team that delivered flawlessly on this project as well as our launch provider Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and our satellite manufacturing partner Airbus Defence and Space.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The I-6 satellites demonstrate Inmarsat&rsquo;s ongoing investment and commitment to its global leadership in L-band satellite services to 2040 and beyond for the benefit of mobility customers worldwide.</p>
			<p>These new capabilities from the I-6s mean greater capacity and coverage, greater speeds and a greater portfolio of innovative connectivity solutions for ELERA and Global Xpress (GX) networks. The I-6 satellites, like all Inmarsat ELERA and GX spacecraft, are backward-compatible with existing terminals, ensuring that current and future customers will continue to benefit from new advances.</p>
			<p>The I-6s also substantially increase the effective capacity of the network available to ELERA customers with double the beams, 50% more spectrum per beam and double the power of the I-4s, matching customer demand as and where it is needed. They also add further depth in Inmarsat&rsquo;s global coverage for even greater assurance to customers of the redundancy and resilience of Inmarsat&rsquo;s world-leading L-band network.</p>
			<p>The GX6 payloads hosted on the I-6s add targeted high capacity to Inmarsat&rsquo;s high-speed GX network, ensuring it continues to support the growing need of commercial and government customers for data, particularly in congested regions or hotspots where it is needed most.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Gilmour_Space_fires_up_for_2022_with_Australias_largest_rocket_engine_test_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>&quot;With timely assessments and approvals from relevant authorities, we hope to be able to launch Australia's first sovereign-made rocket from Queensland sometime in the latter half of 2022.&quot;  </p>
			<p>Rocket engineers at Gilmour Space Technologies have greeted the new year with a successful 110-kilonewton test fire of the most powerful rocket engine ever developed in Australia.</p>
			<p>The 75-second test was a major milestone for Gilmour Space, which is developing Australian Made rockets that will, over the next five years, be capable of launching 300- to 4,000-kilogram satellites and payloads into low earth and other orbits.</p>
			<p>&quot;What you see here is the main engine that will power the first and second stages of our three-stage Eris rocket to space,&quot; explained company CEO, Adam Gilmour.</p>
			<p>&quot;It was a successful test. We achieved our expected full thrust of 110 kilonewtons (or 25,000 pounds-force) over the 75 seconds, and our team will be moving on to the final engine qualification campaign next month.&quot;</p>
			<p>Strategically, the test was also a demonstration of Australia's first sovereign launch capability. &quot;It is no small thing to say that we've developed Australia's largest rocket engine; and that it could have significant flow-on benefits for the commercial, civil and defence space sectors,&quot; he added.</p>
			<p>On where and when Eris will be launched, Mr Gilmour said the company was currently seeking approvals from state and federal government agencies to green light a small orbital spaceport at the Abbot Point State Development Area in Bowen, North Queensland.</p>
			<p>&quot;With timely assessments and approvals from relevant authorities, we hope to be able to launch Australia's first sovereign-made rocket from Queensland sometime in the latter half of 2022.&quot;<br>

			<p><b><i>More satellites from O3b in 2022<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/01/11/more-satellites-from-o3b-in-2022/<br>
			</p>
			<p>SES is just a few weeks away from launching its next &#150; and significantly more powerful &#150; batch of O3b satellites. SES is anticipating the launch of three new satellites in Q1 to join the existing O3b fleet of Medium Earth orbiting (MEO) craft.</p>
			<p>The second batch of another three will launch in Q2. These six, now called mPOWER satellites, will significantly increase the size, power and flexibility of the existing O3b constellation which already comprises 20 satellites and serving customers in some 50 countries. Another trio (mPOWER 7-8-9) of satellites will launch.</p>
			<p>Boeing is building the new versions and SpaceX is contracted to launch the two initial batches from Cape Canaveral on its Falcon 9 rockets. Boeing&rsquo;s order is for a total of 11 mPOWER craft of which 9 will launch this year, and the first six coming into service.</p>
			<p>These additions to the O3b fleet are massively powerful satellites. O3b mPOWER delivers flexible service models by dynamically controlling power levels, throughput, and frequency allocation to reliably meet robust service level agreements. This results in up to 5000 different beams of extremely flexible capacity and offering what SES describes as &ldquo;fibre-equivalent&rdquo; network bandwidth.</p>
			<p>The capacity on the fleet is one of the key appeals of the service and why it has been contracted by Microsoft for its Azure Network Cloud Services. Microsoft says it plans to leverage the MEO high-performance connectivity services to showcase its Azure Orbital solutions that integrate satellite connectivity with Azure services. Microsoft will use SES&rsquo;s current MEO craft to provide connectivity now before migrating to O3b mPOWER in 2022.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Microsoft deploying our ground-breaking O3b mPOWER system is yet another step in our collaboration to bring high-performance, low latency Azure cloud services to customers around the globe,&rdquo; said JP Hemingway, CEO/SES Networks. &ldquo;O3b mPOWER will introduce new levels of cloud-scale satellite connectivity, intelligent automation and managed services that extend the reach and unleash the capabilities of cloud players like never before.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The O3b fleet serves some 96 percent of the planet&rsquo;s global population and operates between the 50 degrees North and 50 degrees South latitudes. They offer extremely appealing low latency of some 150 millieconds.</p>
			<p>SES will unveil its full-year results in February and will update the market on plans for mPOWER&rsquo;s launch and its forecasts for 2022&rsquo;s revenue prospects. The market is expecting further growth from the mPOWER fleet even though these six initial additional craft will not come into full operation much before Q4 this year.<br>

			<p><b><i>Breakup of China&rsquo;s Yunhai-1 (02) satellite linked to space debris collision<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacenews.com/breakup-of-chinas-yunhai-1-02-satellite-linked-to-space-debris-collision/<br>
			</p>
			<p>HELSINKI &#151; U.S. space tracking has linked the breakup of Chinese satellite Yunhai-1 (02) to a collision with a small piece of debris from a Russian satellite launch, according to NASA.</p>
			<p>The Yunhai-1 (02) satellite was developed by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology and launched in September 2019 into a Sun-synchronous orbit with an altitude of around 783 kilometers. It suffered a breakup event on March 18, 2021, creating a number of pieces of debris.</p>
			<p>The 18th Space Control Squadron (18 SPCS) of the U.S. Space Force has identified the breakup of the Yunhai 1-02 meteorological spacecraft (2019-063A) last year to be an accidental collision with a small, mission-related debris object (1996-051Q) associated with the Zenit-2 launch vehicle for the deployment of the Russian Cosmos 2333 military signals intelligence satellite in 1996, according to the December 2021 edition of Orbital Debris Quarterly News, a publication of NASA&rsquo;s Orbital Debris Program Office.</p>
			<p>Darren McKnight, senior technical fellow at LeoLabs and member of the International Academy of Astronautics&rsquo; Space Debris Committee, told SpaceNews that there is &ldquo;moderate confidence that it was a collision,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;the event was likely caused by a piece of debris in the 1-10 centimeter size range.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The breakup of Yunhai-1 (02) is the fifth confirmed accidental collision between two cataloged objects, according to the report. A total of 37 fragments from the collision have been cataloged by the 18 SPCS and as of 1 October 2021, with four of these having reentered the atmosphere.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I think what&rsquo;s notable is that we were actually able to figure out that the breakup was caused by a collision with another object,&rdquo; says Brian Weeden, director of program planning for the Secure World Foundation. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fairly easy to do when the results are catastrophic, as in the case with the [2009] Iridium-Cosmos collision, but there are a lot more smaller scale events that result in minor satellite anomalies and/or release of only a few pieces of debris that are much harder to figure out.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The largest such event was the 2009 collision between the defunct Russian military spacecraft Kosmos-2251 and the operational Iridium 33 communications satellite. That event generated almost 2,000 pieces of trackable debris.</p>
			<p>Suspected collisions can be caused by pieces of debris only a few centimeters in size that are very difficult to consistently or reliably track or maintain in the satellite catalog. Very small debris pieces are sometimes referred to as lethal non-trackable debris. </p>
			<p>In the case of Yunhai-1 (02), it appears 18 SPCS was able to track the impactor to some degree but, given its small size and the challenges of tracking it consistently, did not maintain it in the satellite catalog. </p>
			<p>Remarkably, despite what would have been a high-velocity, high-energy impact, there is evidence from amateur observations that Yunhai-1 (02) is still operational to some degree.</p>
			<p>The Yunhai-1 series of satellites are mainly used for &ldquo;detecting the atmospheric and marine environment and space environment, as well as disaster control and other scientific experiments&rdquo;, according to CASC, SAST&rsquo;s parent company and China&rsquo;s main space contractor. </p>
			<p>No further details have been provided and neither CASC nor SAST have commented on the event or the apparent continuing function of the satellite.<br>

			<p><b><i>Why Elon Musk's SpaceX Starlink satellites look so weird<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/why-elon-musks-spacex-starlink-satellites-look-so-weird/DTUY6ZSZCA5KXU5BUWVBIW2BFQ/<br>
			</p>
			<p>They've already had bewildered Kiwis reaching for their phone cameras &#150; and are a sight we can expect to see more of overhead. So what are Starlink satellites? Jamie Morton explains.</p>
			<p>First off, what are they, exactly?</p>
			<p>If you happen to see a peculiar-looking, chain-like object zipping across the sky at dusk or dawn, it's likely part of Elon Musk's grand vision of offering fibre-speed internet from above.</p>
			<p>That's Starlink &#150; a constellation of more than 1,700 satellites operated by the tech billionaire's SpaceX, and which deliver internet access to remote spots as they communicate with ground-based transceivers from low Earth orbit.</p>
			<p>The reason they first appear as a chain is because that's really what they are: stacks of dozens of flat-panel satellites, weighing just over a quarter of a tonne each.</p>
			<p>With the help of krypton-fuelled ion thrusters, the satellites disperse and climb into their operating orbit, at an altitude of around 550km.</p>
			<p>Most satellite internet services today come from single geostationary satellites that orbit the planet much higher, at about 35,000km.</p>
			<p>Starlink began offering its public beta service to New Zealand customers last year, with monthly packages of unlimited data selling at $159 &#150; but only after installing the dish and other hardware, costing an extra $799.</p>
			<p>University of Auckland astronomer Professor Richard Easther said the satellites were easily distinguishable from the International Space Station, which could also be regularly spotted over New Zealand.</p>
			<p>&quot;While the ISS essentially appears as one bright light, the newly-launched Starlink satellites look like a whole bunch of stars, moving in unison with each other, in a line across the sky.&quot;</p>
			<p>Once they moved higher up and joined orbit, they became harder to spot.</p>
			<p>How often can we see them overhead?</p>
			<p>Kiwis keen to spot the satellites have only to log on to one of several websites that track them.</p>
			<p>According to findstarlink.com, Aucklanders will be able to spot them moving southwest to northeast for six minutes at 5.37am tomorrow morning, or moving west to north for five minutes from 5.19am on Thursday.</p>
			<p>The frequency of these passes, along with their odd appearance, has already caught the attention of many curious Kiwis.</p>
			<p>One morning in May last year, Albany man Simon Russell was letting his cats out when he saw the satellites darting across the sky.</p>
			<p>&quot;It just looked too uniform to be something alien ... it looked like a satellite formation but then I've never heard of a string of 40 or 50 satellites all in a row.&quot;</p>
			<p>Nelson-based space scientist Dr Duncan Steel agreed the spectacle created by the orbiting chain was what captivated people.</p>
			<p>&quot;I saw one a few nights ago coming over, although anybody throughout New Zealand would have been able to see the chain &#150; it's quite a remarkable thing.&quot;</p>
			<p>How fast the satellites were moving depended on their altitude at the time.</p>
			<p>&quot;But typically, things moving in low-Earth orbit are moving at about seven and a half kilometres a second, or about 27,000km/h.&quot;</p>
			<p>Will we see more of them?</p>
			<p>Steel said Kiwis could expect to see a lot more of the satellites if SpaceX went ahead with plans to expand its constellation.</p>
			<p>Eventually, Musk wants to launch as many as 42,000 Starlink satellites &#150; that's 25 times as many currently in orbit &#150; with SpaceX initially focused on sending up around 4,400 into the first five orbital shells.</p>
			<p>The latest launch of 49 satellites &#150; via SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket &#150; took place only days ago.<br>

			<p>&quot;It seems they're launching them every couple of weeks now,&quot; Steel said.</p>
			<p>And SpaceX wasn't the only player in this new space race: other major companies like OneWeb, founded by former Google innovator Greg Wyler, are also developing networks.</p>
			<p>&quot;It's almost like a land grab at the moment, with a lot of companies trying to get these constellations deployed, so if there's tighter regulation at some point in the future, they'll kind of be the incumbents,&quot; Easther said.</p>
			<p>&quot;And because they've got to deploy a lot of these things, you could imagine getting to the point where, if you're out in the bush and look up around dawn or dusk, you'd see a large number of moving points of light in the sky. That would be really weird.&quot;</p>
			<p>What are the other problems?</p>
			<p>Along with the purely aesthetic issue of more clutter in our skies, astronomers have raised some obvious issues.</p>
			<p>They've suggested that the number of visible satellites might come to outnumber visible stars &#150; and that their brightness, on optical and radio wavelengths, could disrupt scientific observations.</p>
			<p>Some scientists have warned this light pollution &#150; which SpaceX has moved to address - could even affect astronomers searching space for Earth-threatening asteroids.</p>
			<p>There have also been concerns the constellations could mess with future space travel, or worsen the already significant risk posed by space debris.</p>
			<p>&quot;We don't know whether we're actually reaching a tipping point,&quot; Steel said.</p>
			<p>&quot;A lot of the Starlink satellites are in relatively low orbits and aren't expected to remain up there forever - they will re-enter [the atmosphere] and that's a preferable thing to staying up there forever.&quot;</p>
			<p>The problem was, he said, whether the satellites disintegrated into debris.</p>
			<p>Some critics have warned of the risk of satellite collisions, potentially triggering a cascade of more collisions called the Kessler syndrome &#150; and even keeping humans stuck on Earth.</p>
			<p>SpaceX has said most of its satellites are launched at lower altitude, with failed satellites expected to deorbit within five years without propulsion.<br>

			<p><b><i>600 Sky Muster satellite broadband users impacted by extended outage<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.queenslandcountrylife.com.au/story/7572172/sky-muster-outage-delivers-dud-christmas-for-hundreds-of-users/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Nearly 600 remote satellite broadband users went without a service throughout the Christmas period, thanks to an 'incident' that impacted NBN Co's Sky Muster and Sky Muster Plus services.</p>
			<p>An nbn spokesman said on Thursday that the company had successfully restored services to 497 premises of the 573 that had been impacted, and were working as quickly as possible to get the remaining 76 premises affected back online.</p>
			<p>It's understood that the incident, the cause of which nbn isn't commenting on, initially affected 34 per cent or just under 38,000 satellite customers on December 21, but most had their service restored soon after.</p>
			<p>For the rest, about 0.5pc of the total, it has been an extremely frustrating couple of weeks without internet.</p>
			<p>One of those impacted was Winton's Donna Paynter, who had visitors with small children staying for the Christmas period.</p>
			<p>&quot;We have mobile coverage so we at least had a way of communicating, but it was so hot over those days - you just want to be inside, making use of your Christmas presents, or catching up with bookwork,&quot; she said.</p>
			<p>She and husband John returned home on December 23 to discover there was no internet and initially thought the extreme heat may have been the cause.</p>
			<p>&quot;But it was just us - all our neighbours had internet - it was very odd,&quot; she said.</p>
			<p>The outage affected premises seemingly at random across Australia.</p>
			<p>The Better Internet for Regional Rural and Remote Australia group said it was disappointing that it was taking so long to resolve the problem.</p>
			<p>&quot;Some of our members have been without a connection over Christmas and new year and during cyclone and fire season,&quot; a spokesperson said.</p>
			<p>&quot;We understand that no technology is 100pc reliable, however we encourage nbn to ensure processes are put in place that prevent extended outages in the future, particularly when our research shows that over 40pc of nbn Sky Muster users don't have an alternate connection.&quot;</p>
			<p>The increasing level of frustration from customers was reflected in advice being distributed by retail service providers such as Skymesh as the outage stretched on.</p>
			<p>&quot;SkyMesh has been and will continue to place extreme pressure on nbn Co for an outcome for these services and expect further information from nbn Co with urgency today,&quot; one of SkyMesh's advisory notes said.</p>
			<p>&quot;SkyMesh, to date, are yet to receive any solid communication on the root cause of these ongoing issues.</p>
			<p>&quot;We will continue to advocate and work alongside nbn Co at their request to get this outage resolved.&quot;</p>
			<p>Nbn said the outage was likely related to an incident that occurred on December 21.</p>
			<p>It thanked customers for their patience and apologised for the inconvenience people were experiencing.</p>
			<p>Both BIRRR and Ms Paynter paid tribute to SkyMesh for keeping people informed throughout the extended outage.</p>
			<p>&quot;SkyMesh was very communicative, even on Christmas Eve,&quot; Ms Paynter said.</p>
			<p>SkyMesh has since advised that it was intending to give customers a credit for time offline in bulk, meaning they would not need to speak with the company in order to receive it.</p>
			<p>A statement said that many customers had &quot;understandably&quot; called to request a credit for their time offline.</p>
			<p>&quot;We expect this will be completed in the coming weeks as we complete a debrief with nbn at the resolution of the outage,&quot; the statement read.</p>
			<p>Former Maranoa MP Bruce Scott, who lives at Roma in south western Queensland, commented on social media that it was &quot;a timely reminder that for people living in rural and remote areas in a emergency, a clear voice telephone service is essential and could be a life saver as a satellite service can and does fail&quot;.</p>
			<p>The BIRRR spokesperson said any consumers that remained offline should contact their provider.<br>

			<p><b><i>SpaceX successfully completes first launch of 2022 from Florida<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/SpaceX_successfully_completes_first_launch_of_2022_from_Florida_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>SpaceX kicked off a surge in launch activity Thursday with the successful launch of 49 of the company's Starlink communications satellites from Florida, heading south along the state's coastline.</p>
			<p>Five SpaceX missions may launch in the next month on the southern polar trajectory, flying closer to the Florida coast toward Miami than most launches, according to the U.S. Space Force.</p>
			<p>The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off as planned at 4:49 p.m. EST from Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center. Nine minutes after launch, the first-stage booster landed successfully on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
			<p>&quot;Starlink is now live in 25 countries and regions currently servicing over 145,000 users worldwide,&quot; SpaceX engineer Jessie Anderson said during a live broadcast of the launch.</p>
			<p>&quot;We're flying in the south ... trajectory to increase recovery weather availability for both the booster and fairing during the winter months,&quot; Anderson said.</p>
			<p>Officials are asking boaters and aircraft to be especially vigilant to avoid the southern flight paths, which are announced in maritime and aviation notices, U.S. Space Force Lt. Col. Brian Eno, commander of the 1st Range Operations Squad, part of Space Launch Delta 45, said in an interview with UPI.</p>
			<p>Space Launch Delta 45 is responsible for regional launch activities.</p>
			<p>&quot;We really want to make sure that the community understands that this is different, because most rockets launched here travel east over the Atlantic, but we will see a lot more launching south this year, and that means a different set of conditions or awareness and for accommodating air traffic and marine traffic,&quot; Eno said.</p>
			<p>The government requires boaters and aviators to stay away from restricted launch areas, and those areas will be changing for some of the southern launches, he said.</p>
			<p>Thursday's launch restriction zones weren't much different than traditional Cape launch zones, he said. But two launches SpaceX plans in January will see restricted areas extended 26 miles south for boats and 172 miles south for planes.</p>
			<p>SpaceX launched a record number of rockets in 2021, at 31 missions from Florida and California. But the Space Force anticipates 66 launches in 2022 from Florida alone, Eno said.</p>
			<p>&quot;We want to make sure that nothing is taken for granted, that nobody thinks launches only happen a certain way or direction off the Cape, because there is so much more activity,&quot; Eno said.</p>
			<p>Rockets sometimes head south from the Cape because they aim to achieve a polar orbit, over the North and South Poles, rather than an equatorial orbit, Moriba Jah, associate professor of aerospace engineering the University of Texas at Austin, told UPI in a phone interview.</p>
			<p>SpaceX has launched more than 1,800 Starlink satellites in dozens of missions over the past few years, while new space companies like Rocket Lab have emerged. With more satellites in orbit, companies seek new locations for them, Jah said.</p>
			<p>&quot;There is really a new space race, just like with a gold rush, and we're putting more and more of our technological infrastructure in space,&quot; Jah said. &quot;And so you've seen this increase in the launches and number of satellites for sure.&quot;</p>
			<p>Some space companies, like SpaceX's Starlink service, seek to cover most of the globe with their services. To do so, they must travel around the poles in order to take images or beam signals from extreme northern or southern latitudes, he said.</p>
			<p>&quot;Sea and air traffic may suffer as a consequence of these launches because of safety reasons, but efforts are under way to minimize the impact of interruptions,&quot; he said.<br>

			<p><b><i>Inmarsat&rsquo;s First Hybrid Satellite Reaches Major Milestones In Orbit<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://simpleflying.com/inmarsat-first-i-6-begins-eor/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Inmarsat has today announced the deployment of its most advanced commercial communications satellite yet. The I-6 F1 satellite was launched by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) from the JAXA Tanegashima Space Center in Japan on December 22nd, 2021.</p>
			<p>The satellite was successfully acquired, and on Christmas Eve, its apogee thruster firing and solar array deployment were completed. Days later, the nine-meter-wide L-band reflector was also deployed without any issues.</p>
			<p>Now, Inmarsat has begun the next critical stage of the deployment of its first I-6 &#150; Electric Orbit Raising (EOR). The EOR process, which takes the satellite to its final location in geostationary orbit via an all-electric propulsion system, is expected to take around 200 days to complete.</p>
			<p>Rajeev Suri, CEO of Inmarsat, said,</p>
			<p>    &ldquo;This launch marks Inmarsat&rsquo;s newest technological leap forward as we maintain our strong commercial momentum and sector leadership. This satellite extends our world leading mobile satellite communications services for our customers and partners, especially in the Indo Pacific region. I-6 F1 will play a crucial role in Inmarsat&rsquo;s world-leading, dynamic mesh network ORCHESTRA as we plot the course to further connectivity innovation for our customers.</p>
			<p>    &ldquo;My warmest thanks and congratulations go to the Inmarsat team that delivered flawlessly on this project as well as our launch provider Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and our satellite manufacturing partner Airbus Defence and Space.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>One I-6 F1 arrives in its final position, roughly some 22,500 miles (36,000 km) away from Earth, it will enter an extensive testing phase. Supported by ground stations in Perth and Merredin in Western Australia F1 will enter into service in early 2023.</p>
			<p>What will the I-6s be doing?</p>
			<p>The I-6 is the first-ever hybrid L- and Ka-band satellite from Inmarsat, and F1 is number one of seven that are planned for launch by 2024. F2 is already built, and is undergoing ground testing ahead of a launch in early 2023.</p>
			<p>For airlines and other Inmarsat customers, the increased capacity and technological advances delivered by I-6 promise a much-enhanced end-user experience. These new technology satellites are the backbone of the ELERA L-band services, which will make it possible to embrace next-generation technologies like the &lsquo;Internet of Things&rsquo;.<br>
				orchestra</p>
			<p>As well as increasing capacity and resilience, the I-6s will also offer additional high-speed broadband capacity for Inmarsat&rsquo;s renowned Global Xpress (GX) network. As one of the most widely used networks in aviation, GX underpins the connectivity of many of the world&rsquo;s leading international airlines and already boasts a fleet of 14 geostationary satellites.</p>
			<p>The I-6 launch is one of the first steps on the road to Inmarsat&rsquo;s multi-spectrum, multi-orbit network of the future &#150; ORCHESTRA. This eventual network will bring together GEO, highly elliptical orbit (HEO), low Earth orbit (LEO) and terrestrial 5G in a powerful, reliable package.<br>

			<p><b><i>Concern over new NBTC board's willingness to act<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2243319/concern-over-new-nbtc-boards-willingness-to-act<br>
			</p>
			<p>Telecom veterans have expressed concerns about the new National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) board's capability and courage in dealing with various critical tasks ahead, especially the planned auction for the right to use satellite orbital slots.</p>
			<p>The new board is also expected to face an uphill task attracting bidders for spectrum licences for the auction of the 3500-megahertz range, as major mobile operators already shoulder a large financial burden from previous auctions of 4G and 5G spectrum licences.</p>
			<p>Late last month, the Senate voted in favour of five of seven prospective candidates becoming new board members of the NBTC.</p>
			<p>The new board members will start working once they are royally endorsed.</p>
			<p>However, the new board members have drawn flak among industry veterans, who questioned their ability and courage to deal with critical tasks.</p>
			<p>A telecom veteran who requested anonymity said there are several tough tasks pending and they have the risk of faltering under the supervision of the new board.</p>
			<p>One of the key tasks is the country's first auction for the right to use satellite orbital slots. The plan was scrapped in August last year after SET-listed Thaicom through its wholly owned firm, TC Space Connect, was the only contestent.</p>
			<p>The country risks losing some orbital slots for failing to coordinate usage of them under an International Telecommunication Union (ITU) regulation by early 2022.</p>
			<p>Following the scrapping of the auction, the NBTC pledged to adjust the principle and method of the auction to create better conditions. However, the regulator has yet to make progress with the issue or come up with a new auction timeline, the source noted.</p>
			<p>Another telecom source pointed out that it is hard for the NBTC to draw up a new auction timeline as long as Thaicom is still seen as the sole prospective bidder.</p>
			<p>The source said the NBTC must be brave enough to directly allocate some orbital slots to National Telecom (NT) through a regulatory amendment, which would allow NT to make use of the slots for some public benefits.</p>
			<p>&quot;The NBTC board needs to pioneer the move,&quot; the source said.</p>
			<p>The source also pointed out that it is highly unlikely that mobile operators would be interested in joining the planned auction of the 3500MHZ spectrum as the major carriers have already spent so much on 4G and 5G spectrum licences.</p>
			<p>Bandwidth consumption is also now getting saturated with no new breakthrough of applications in mass market, the source said.</p>
			<p>Additionally, True Corporation and Total Access Communication, two major mobile operators, are now moving towards a merger, which would reduce the number of major carriers from three to two.</p>
			<p>&quot;A challenge lies in how to choose the most proper way to allocate the spectrum range to operators in a way that should also create public benefits,&quot; the veteran said.</p>
			<p>The five chosen board members comprise: Air Marshal Thanapant Raicharoen, deputy secretary-general of the NBTC; Pirongrong Ramasoota, a lecturer at Chulalongkorn University's Faculty of Communication Arts; Dr Sarana Boonbaichaiyapruck, a medical specialist and a former member of the defunct National Legislative Assembly; Torpong Selanon, president of the Thailand Association of the Blind; and Suphat Suphachalasai, director of Thammasat University's Institute of Area Studies.<br>

			<p><b><i>Arianespace to launch eight new Galileo satellites<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.gpsworld.com/arianespace-to-launch-eight-new-galileo-satellites/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Arianespace will launch eight additional Galileo satellites, confirmed the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA).</p>
			<p>Arianespace will launch the first two satellites in 2022, leading to the Full Operational Capability of Galileo open service. Then, three successive launches on Ariane 62 in 2023, 2024 and 2025 will finalize the launch of the first generation of Galileo satellites and will increase the constellation resilience.</p>
			<p>These will be the 13th to 16th Galileo missions by Arianespace, which has orbited all satellites in the constellation.</p>
			<p>With this order, EUSPA takes over the role of placing launch services contracts for Galileo from the European Space Agency (ESA), which has acted so far in the name and on behalf of the European Commission and will continue to be the technical authority for these launches.</p>
			<p>The order follows ESA&rsquo;s order for the launch of four satellites in October 2021, and will complete the deployment of first-generation Galileo satellites.</p>
			<p>The launches will take place from the Guiana Space Center, Europe&rsquo;s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. After a Galileo launch in the first half of this year, carrying satellites from a previous order, a second Soyuz launch this year will orbit the first two satellites from this latest order. The next three missions will orbit two satellites each on Ariane 62.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I would like to thank ESA and EUSPA, along with the European Commission, for continuing to entrust us with their satellites,&rdquo; said St&eacute;phane Isra&euml;l, CEO of Arianespace. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very proud to once again be helping the EU deploy its own global navigation satellite system. This additional order to the service of Galileo once again confirms Arianespace&rsquo;s assigned mission of ensuring reliable access to space for Europe.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Each of the eight satellites under this order, built by OHB System AG in Bremen, Germany, will weigh less than 730 kg. They will join the 28 Galileo satellites already deployed to date, as well as the two to be orbited in early 2022 from the Guiana Space Center by Arianespace.<br>

				From https://www.ibc.org/ibc-daily/broad-horizons-for-satellite-communications-with-intelsat/8254.article<br>
			</p>
			<p>Satellite communications provider Intelsat is reporting strong growth in central and Eastern Europe, as the market there for HD expands, along with a number of channels there for some of its primary partners, including namely Slovac Telecom and RCS in Romania.</p>
			<p>Rhys Morgan, RVP Europe and MENA sales, Intelsat, told IBC: &ldquo;The company is also looking into the future, assessing how its activities can work in the cloud. The next generation of software is a defined networking strategy, which will be a combination of a massively increased terrestrial presence and more sophisticated backend. A new constellation of satellites that will learn that will feed into that &#150; software defined, with a tremendous capacity yet very flexible.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The biggest challenge, he said, is the transition from linear delivery.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We have to deploy a lot of space-based infrastructure,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which historically has not been easy to repurpose. With the software defined approach, we can actually change the way the satellites perform quite quickly.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;By increasing flexibility and providing more automation so that all of our services are simpler &#150; a &lsquo;one pane of glass&rsquo; approach, which hasn&rsquo;t been our traditional approach, we&rsquo;re able to move to a more unified and seamless experience.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The company is finishing the first phase of its C-Band clearing in the US, which will free up several hundred MHz of spectrum for mobile network operators, a project which, he said, has involved a lot of human, technical and physical resources.</p>
			<p>It is also recovering from its Chapter 11 financial restructuring, which, said Rhys, &ldquo;means we can do some exciting things related to integrated networks. We are also looking at bringing new partners on board to broaden our service portfolio and beginning to ramp up reinvestment in the business and future proof us and make sure that we&rsquo;re here for our customers, and meeting the challenges that all of our partners are currently grappling with.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Cinedigm to acquire DMR <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/01/07/cinedigm-to-acquire-dmr/<br>
			</p>
			<p>In a move that adds significantly to its scale, enthusiast streaming services specialist Cinedigm has reached an agreement to acquire Digital Media Rights (DMR), a diversified speciality streaming, advertising, and content distribution company with significant expertise in building audiences for global content in North America.</p>
			<p>Founded more than a decade ago by media industry veterans Michael Hong and David Chu, DMR focuses on four key streaming businesses. First, the company is a leading global distributor of feature films and television series for the streaming ecosystem, with more than 7,500 titles under distribution.</p>
			<p>Secondly, DMR has developed and operates 10 channels focused on enthusiast audiences.  Six of these proprietary streaming services are available as free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) channels and/or video-on-demand apps (all apps have ad-supported VoD and premium, subscription VoD options):<br>
				&bull;AsianCrush (asiancrush.com): The one-stop portal to the latest Asian entertainment featuring premium movies and shows.<br>
				&bull;Midnight Pulp (midnightpulp.com): The perfect late-night channel to end all boredom, offering an expertly curated selection of cult programming with a twist of millennial irreverence.<br>
				&bull;RetroCrush (retrocrush.tv): Dedicated to the Golden Age of anime.<br>
				&bull;Cinehouse (www.cinehousetv.com): both a standalone channel with apps available across all major devices, as well as a Linear TV streaming bundle, curating niche, enthusiast channels focused on the best movies and TV shows from around the world. Among the linear FAST channels available in Cinehouse&rsquo;s lineup are 24/7 streams of AsianCrush, RetroCrush, Midnight Pulp and KMTV, with more being announced in 2022.<br>
				&bull;Cocoro (cocoro.tv): The ultimate destination for kid-friendly shows designed to educate and entertain.<br>
				&bull;KMTV (kmtvnow.com): Features all things K-Pop, from music videos of the newest releases to variety show highlights, to all things in between.</p>
			<p>Third, through its DMR Social unit, DMR curates social video channels for most of the above brands, as well as four others, with more in development:<br>
				&bull;C-Crush: A community for fans of the best Chinese TV and movies.<br>
				&bull;Cinehouse Romance: A curated selection of romance-focused movie clips from DMR&rsquo;s library of arthouse and indie films.<br>
				&bull;K-Crush: A community for Korean cinema, TV and pop culture addicts.<br>
				&bull;QTTV: A community for fans of queer cinema.</p>
			<p>Lastly, DMR operates an Ad Network &amp; Marketplace garnering more than 100 million connected TV impressions a month against long-form, premium movies and television shows across their owned-and-operated and selected partner channels with an average ad completion rate of over 95 per cent.</p>
			<p>Upon completion of the deal, Cinedigm will increase its library to more than 46,000 hours of premium film and television content, with an estimated 40+ million monthly viewers, 18.5 million social subscribers, 4 billion views, and 13 billion minutes viewed annually. With the addition of the seven new owned, proprietary channels, the Company will have 15 wholly-owned streaming services, which now comprises more than 50 per cent of its 28 channels in operation.</p>
			<p>With a significant portion of DMR&rsquo;s portfolio focused on premium Asian film and television content, the addition of its wildly popular titles to Cinedigm&rsquo;s content portfolio will help fill the growing consumer demand for Asian-influenced media, such as Japanese anime and Korean dramas, across the entertainment landscape.</p>
			<p>According to Ampere Analysis, more than 25 per cent of all North American consumers now watch foreign content, with Squid Game and Narcos being examples of two breakout hits reflecting the trend. Given DMR&rsquo;s tight programming and demographic alignment with Cinedigm&rsquo;s existing subscription services, the Company plans on leveraging each Company&rsquo;s respective content portfolio to enhance and broaden the Company&rsquo;s existing streaming services.</p>
			<p>Cinedigm also plans to further expand DMR&rsquo;s Advertising Network, which has long-standing customers and direct partnerships with key advertising partners, with the Company&rsquo;s robust programmatic ad sales infrastructure. In conjunction with Cinedigm&rsquo;s continued investment in technology and supply-chain automation via the Company&rsquo;s proprietary Matchpoint platform, the Company believes it will reduce DMR&rsquo;s operating costs and strengthen its revenue growth by leveraging its unique competitive advantage in the streaming business and through its underlying technology. Migrating DMR&rsquo;s entire content library into the Matchpoint platform will allow the Company to efficiently expand the distribution of DMR&rsquo;s film &amp; television content catalogue and easily deliver it at significant scale to Cinedigm&rsquo;s extensive network of OTT platforms and third-party distribution partners at the click of a button.</p>
			<p>Finally, Cinedigm plans to leverage DMR&rsquo;s social media division to grow engagement and followers of Cinedigm&rsquo;s streaming channels on the leading social media platforms. DMR&rsquo;s social media unit brings extensive expertise in curating content to help drive new distribution, revenue and marketing opportunities. DMR Social has a footprint of more than 17 million subscribers and followers on YouTube and Facebook alone, across eight brands that are collectively averaging 284 million video views per month &#151; and more than 8 million hours watched &#151; over the past year. DMR&rsquo;s community-building and content curation techniques and expertise will be applied to Cinedigm&rsquo;s portfolio of channels including Fandor, CONtv and Screambox. The goal is to establish a new ad revenue stream for the Company and help grow Cinedigm&rsquo;s SVOD, AVOD and FAST streaming channels.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;DMR&rsquo;s top-notch management team, high-quality channels and film &amp; TV library perfectly complement our own strengths and our mission of serving enthusiast audiences,&rdquo; commented Chris McGurk, Chairman and CEO at Cinedigm. &ldquo;When you consider the other key additive components from this deal, including the global reach of DMR&rsquo;s expansive social media efforts, we are well-positioned to not only reach a rapidly growing new audience in the short-term but also to expand the scale of a larger Cinedigm umbrella channel strategy in the long run. We expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive, and the leverage of Cinedigm&rsquo;s technological efficiencies and expansive portfolio of assets will spur significant additional growth.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Rarely do you find an acquisition that is as complementary as DMR,&rdquo; said Erick Opeka, President of Cinedigm Networks and Chief Strategy Officer of Cinedigm. &ldquo;This portfolio of channels and content immediately provides increased scale, strengthens the content offering on our flagship services, provides critical growth and marketing capabilities via social, and gives us a new foothold into the direct ad sales and streaming live television businesses. We look forward to starting out the new fiscal year with the people and assets we need to meet the growing needs of our viewers, platforms and advertisers.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The strong synergy between Cinedigm and DMR is readily apparent, and by working together, we can continue to deliver and further scale our top-notch, curated streaming channels to our audiences in a way that builds a true sense of community,&rdquo; said David Chu, Co-Founder and CEO of DMR. &ldquo;The team at DMR is proud to have built an impressive lineup of channels and offer content that can meet the rising demands of audiences around the world, including fans of incredibly popular Korean dramas, Japanese anime, and Chinese TV, as well as arthouse, romance and horror movies. It&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re thrilled to align with this key industry player and are looking forward to a future with even more expansion opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s deal with Cinedigm marks a watershed moment for David and I,&rdquo; added DMR Co-Founder and Chairman Mike Hong. &ldquo;As entrepreneurs, we&rsquo;re incredibly excited to see more than a decade of hard work fuelling the ongoing growth of DMR, now culminating in this acquisition which will provide the foundation to take the company to even more heights.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Big hunk of failed Russian rocket crashes to Earth as space junk<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.space.com/russian-space-junk-angara-a5-rocket-fall<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Persei upper stage's brief stay in orbit is over.</p>
			<p>The space junk population just got a tiny bit smaller.</p>
			<p>The Persei upper stage of a Russian Angara A5 heavy-lift rocket crashed back to Earth in an uncontrolled fashion today (Jan. 5), hitting the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean at 4:08 p.m. EST (2108 GMT). </p>
			<p>&quot;Persei reentry confirmed: 2108 UTC over 121W 14S in the South [Pacific],&quot; astronomer and satellite tracker Jonathan McDowell, who's based at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said via Twitter today. </p>
			<p>That latitude/longitude location corresponds to an empty patch of sea east of French Polynesia.</p>
			<p>The fall ended nine days aloft for Persei, which got stranded with a dummy payload during a test flight that launched on Dec. 27. Persei apparently dug its own grave, failing to restart as planned for a second engine burn that would have sent it from low Earth orbit to a much higher geostationary perch.</p>
			<p>Persei was quite a large piece of space debris. At liftoff, it weighed about 21.5 tons (19.5 metric tons) here on Earth, but most of that was propellant. That fuel was likely vented during the stage's stay in orbit, so the chunk that fell back to Earth probably tipped the scales at around 3.5 tons (3.2 metric tons), according to Anatoly Zak of RussianSpaceWeb.com.</p>
			<p>Most of the rocket body almost certainly burned up in Earth's atmosphere today, according to McDowell, who analyzes publicly available tracking data. So don't expect to find any giant, smoking craters (if any pieces came down over terra firma).</p>
			<p>&quot;Any damage from surviving debris will be minor (it might dent some poor person's roof, but it won't wipe out humanity),&quot; McDowell wrote via Twitter on Tuesday (Jan. 4). </p>
			<p>He was responding in that case to a follower who asked if the Persei crash would resemble the scenario laid out in the 2021 film &quot;Don't Look Up,&quot; which tells the story of two astronomers who try to warn people about a big comet streaking toward Earth. (The film is a satire, and the incoming comet is a metaphor for climate change and humanity's tepid response to its disastrous impacts.)</p>
			<p>In May 2021, in a controversial example of a big space junk fall, the 23-ton core stage of a Chinese Long March 5B booster came down after 10 days in Earth orbit. </p>
			<p>The Long March 5B had successfully lofted the core module for China's new space station on April 28. The rocket's core stage made it all the way to orbit that day, becoming a piece of space junk instead of diving into the ocean shortly after liftoff as first-stage boosters do on most launches. Hence the controversy.</p>
			<p>The Dec. 27 launch was the third test flight for the Angara A5, development of which has been plagued by a series of delays. The first two launches of the heavy lifter, which took place in December 2014 and December 2020, both succeeded in delivering dummy payloads to the desired orbit.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s SpaceX is planning to launch a batch of Starlink satellites this week.</p>
			<p>The launch, subject to the usual weather considerations, is scheduled for 16:49 EST (21.49 GMT), with a backup time available at 18:47 EST (23.47 GMT) on January 6th.</p>
			<p>The SpaceX mission, officially dubbed Starlink 4-5 is looking to place the batch in an orbital plane of 53.2 degrees to the Equator. In order to achieve this orbital position the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will launch from the Kennedy Space Center but aimed southeast and to the North of the Bahama islands.</p>
			<p>It is not known how many Starlink satellites will be on board but usually a SpaceX flight carries between 48-53 craft on each mission. The rocket&rsquo;s booster is planned to land on the drone vessel, &lsquo;A Shortfall of Gravitas&rsquo;, waiting in the Atlantic.</p>
			<p>Jonathan Hofeller, SpaceX&rsquo;s VP/Starlink commercial sales, said last month that the Starlink network is already providing internet service to consumers in more than 20 countries.</p>
			<p>On January 13th, another SpaceX launch is planned. This mission will carry dozens of paying satellite customers on the rocket&rsquo;s Transporter 3 flight with smaller satellites. This flight will see the rocket return to Earth and land at an onshore pad at Cape Canaveral.</p>

			<p>Starlink, a division of Musk's SpaceX aerospace company, has already received over 5,000 pre-orders for its devices in India but is struggling to receive commercial licences without which it cannot offer services in the country.</p>
			<p>&quot;Unfortunately, the timeline for receiving licences to operate is currently unknown, and there are several issues that must be resolved with the licensing framework to allow us to operate Starlink in India,&quot; the company said in the email.</p>
			<p>&quot;The Starlink team is looking forward to making Starlink available in India as soon as possible,&quot; it said.</p>
			<p>Starlink is one of a growing number of companies launching small satellites as part of a low-Earth orbit network to provide low-latency broadband internet services around the world, with a particular focus on remote areas that terrestrial internet infrastructure struggles to reach.</p>
			<p>But the Indian government has advised people against subscribing to Starlink without a licence and ordered the company to refrain from taking bookings and rendering services.</p>
			<p>Starlink is planning to apply for a commercial licence in India by the end of January, its country head Sanjay Bhargava had said in a social media post last month, and a presentation showed that with an April roll out it targeted 200,000 devices in India by December 2022.</p>
			<p>However, in a LinkedIn poston Tuesday Bhargava said he has stepped down as country director and board chairman due to &quot;personal reasons&quot;. According to his profile on the platform, he had taken up the role in October.</p>
			<p>Starlink'srivals include Amazon.com's Kuiper and OneWeb - a collapsed satellite operator rescued by the British government and India's Bharti Group.<br>

			<p><b><i>Next OneWeb launch slips to March <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2022/01/05/next-oneweb-launch-slips-to-march/<br>
			</p>
			<p>A planned January launch of 36 OneWeb broadband satellites has slipped from January to March.</p>
			<p>Russia&rsquo;s space corporation Roscosmos says it has adjusted the launch date to March 5th. The last launch was on December 27th 2021 which went as planned.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In accordance with the 2022 launch schedule approved by the state corporation Roscosmos, the launch of a Soyuz-2.1b carrier rocket with the Fregat booster and 36 OneWeb satellites from the Baikonur cosmodrome is scheduled for March 5, 2022,&rdquo; Roscosmos said in a statement.</p>
			<p>The statement added that the shift in launch date has happened as a result of its customer&rsquo;s request.</p>
			<p>While not directly affecting operations at Baikonur in Kazakhstan, the country is in the middle of significant protests and violent demonstrations over price rises for petrol and diesel fuel.</p>
			<p>The 36 OneWeb spacecraft are now due to arrive at the Baikonur launch site on February 10th. There are a total of 7 launches planned for this year.</p>
			<p>OneWeb&rsquo;s orbital cluster now comprises 394 satellites, and some two-thirds of the planned constellation.<br>

			<p>Hughes will hold a 67 per cent stake in the JV while Airtel will hold a 33 per cent stake.</p>
			<p>airtel, bharti airtel, bharti airtel newsCombined India VSAT operations of both companies to offer a wide range of satellite and hybrid network solutions to business and government customers (Image: Reuters) </p>
			<p>Bharti Airtel has announced the formation of a joint venture with Hughes Communications India Pvt Ltd (HCIPL), an innovator in satellite and networks to offer satellite broadband services in India.</p>
			<p>Hughes will hold a 67 per cent stake in the joint venture, while Airtel will hold a 33 per cent stake. The entity will be known as HCIPL and will combine the Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) business of both companies, allowing them to offer scalable enterprise networking solutions. VSAT is a two-way ground station that transmits and receives data from satellites. It is used to provide satellite-based internet and telecom access to individuals and enterprise customers.</p>
			<p>This development comes at a time when tech billionaire Elon Musk-led Starlink&rsquo;s country director for India, Sanjay Bhargava, announced on January 4 that he has stepped down from his post at the satellite internet venture citing personal reasons.</p>
			<p>Airtel and Hughes Communications&rsquo; agreement was first announced in May 2019, and the company in a press release said that it has received all statutory approvals, including those from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and Department of Telecom (Government of India) and the joint venture has been formed.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to commence this joint venture, further delivering on our commitment to serving the growing demand for always-on, always-available network connectivity for enterprise and government customers,&rdquo; said Partho Banerjee, president, and managing director, HCIPL. &ldquo;Combining the proven capabilities of both Hughes and Airtel, the partnership will bring synergies to the forefront &#150; including multi-orbit solutions &#150; for the benefit of customers across the length and breadth of India.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The JV has a combined base of over 2 lakh VSATs, making it the largest satellite service operator in the country. &ldquo;We, at Airtel, are focused on supporting and accelerating the digital transformation journeys of our customers through an integrated solutions portfolio. With the combined capabilities of Airtel and Hughes, customers will get access to next-generation satellite connectivity backed by proven enterprise-grade security and service support,&rdquo; said Ajay Chitkara, director and chief executive officer, Airtel Business.<br>

			<p><b><i>Tennis Channel picks up WTA rights in four European markets<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2022/01/05/tennis-channel-picks-up-wta-rights-in-four-european-markets/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Tennis Channel has announced a two-year rights deal with the Women&rsquo;s Tennis Association (WTA) for Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands.</p>
			<p>The deal will see the Sinclair Broadcast Group-owned network serve as the primary rights holder for the WTA across the four countries, showing all WTA 1000, WTA 500, and WTA 250 events. In the Netherlands, WTA 1000 events will be first shown on Ziggo TV with the Tennis Channel broadcasting them on delay.</p>
			<p>The deal is the latest announced between the WTA and the Tennis Channel, with the relationship going back to the network&rsquo;s debut in 2003.</p>
			<p>Ken Solomon, Tennis Channel president, said: &ldquo;This is about opening the funnel to what makes tennis great to a far larger audience. This WTA deal will allow us to show in that part of the world the full continuity of the sport and every single [women&rsquo;s] match that has a television camera on it. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to see the sport as it really and fully exists, which hasn&rsquo;t been available up to now outside of the United States. This is a watershed moment. What we are now able to do is leverage a world-class, scalable infrastructure,&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Micky Lawler, WTA president, said: &ldquo;There are no limits to what they can do to tell the story of the game and its players. I remember thinking long before the advance of streaming and direct-to-consumer that it would be great to bring this to additional countries, and now it&rsquo;s come full circle and is happening.&rdquo;<br>

			<p>Last update of the year, and what a year it has been with widespread disruptions due to covid. Certainly sports feeds over C and KU took a big hit with many live sports events being cancelled. I'm part way through my own project which has been disrtupted by Covid, having a brand new house built which hopefully should be completed around March. It was supposed to be ready by October 21st. However this has worked out in my favour as due to the crazy house market here. The house is already worth  several hundred thousand more than what was paid for it!<br>

							<br>
						</i></b>From https://torrentfreak.com/aussie-federal-court-orders-isps-to-block-101-pirate-movie-tv-show-domains-211222/<br>
				</p>
				<p>Australia's Federal Court has ordered dozens of local ISPs to prevent subscribers from accessing more than 100 domains linked to pirate streaming and torrent sites. The movie and TV studio applicants, which include members of the MPA plus Village Roadshow, also tried to broaden their ability to deal with new threats but the Court spotted the move and ruled accordingly.</p>
				<p>australiaIn December 2016 and after substantial work to amend the law, an Australian court ordered the blocking of several pirate sites headed up by the infamous The Pirate Bay.</p>
				<p>Over the five years since, movie companies including Roadshow Films, Disney, Paramount, Columbia, Universal, Warner, and more recently Netflix have returned to court time and again to have hundreds more sites blocked. The aim, as always, is to slow down rampant movie and TV show piracy.<br>
					New Application for Blocking Injunction</p>
				<p>Back in September 2021, these companies along with Television Broadcasts Limited and TVBI Company Limited filed a new application at the Federal Court, seeking the blocking of more than 100 domains under Section 115A of the Copyright Act 1968. The application targeted 48 ISPs operated by Telstra, Optus, Vocus, TPG and Vodafone corporate groups.</p>
				<p>The applicants claimed that the 101 domains relate to 63 &lsquo;pirate&rsquo; sites that either infringe or facilitate the infringement of copyright in large numbers of movies and TV shows owned by them. They further reported that since the sites (full list below) are operated from outside Australia, they are eligible for blocking.<br>
					Court Issues Judgment</p>
				<p>In an extremely thorough judgment handed down this week, Justice Nicholas largely found in favor of the applicants. He acknowledged that the copyright holders had made reasonable efforts to identify the people behind the sites and that none of them had applied to be joined as a party in the proceedings, despite being notified of the legal action.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;The evidence satisfies me that each of the target online locations identified in the applicants&rsquo; proposed orders infringes or facilitates the infringement of the applicants&rsquo; copyright in various well-known cinematograph films,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I am also satisfied that the target online locations have the primary purpose, or the primary effect, of infringing or facilitating an infringement of copyright in large numbers of commercially released cinematograph films.&rdquo;<br>
				</p>
				<p>Dynamic Injunction Applies</p>
				<p>When blocking injunctions are handed down in Australia against specific domains, targeted sites sometimes choose to change the way they operate. This can include changes to domain names and/or IP addresses in the hope that blocks can be evaded.</p>
				<p>To counter this threat, so-called &lsquo;dynamic injunctions&rsquo; allow copyright holders to notify ISPs of the changes and if no objections are received, sites made available through modified means will also be blocked, if the copyright holders have a good faith belief they are the same platforms.</p>
				<p>That is also the case here but in this application, the movie and TV studios also attempted to expand their ability to block sites that aren&rsquo;t necessarily part of the original order.<br>
					Studios Attempt to Block &lsquo;Pirate Brands&rsquo;</p>
				<p>In recent years there has been a trend of pirate sites launching with the same naming conventions as others, in an attempt to attract users who may be familiar with a specific &lsquo;brand&rsquo;. A good example is that of &lsquo;123Movies&rsquo; which can be found repeated across numerous competitors that aren&rsquo;t necessarily connected to the original site.</p>
				<p>An expert for the applicants told the Court that when a &lsquo;branded&rsquo; pirate site is blocked, new websites appear with the same functionality under similar but different domains. A solicitor for the applicants argued that new iterations of &ldquo;online locations&rdquo; can sometimes look substantially similar to the original blocked sites, but with aesthetic or structural differences such as layouts or different categorizations for content.</p>
				<p>It seems that the copyright holders would like functionally similar websites with similar names to be blocked under the original order. However, the Judge wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with the approach. A site with a different domain, IP address and different URL is not the same &ldquo;online location&rdquo; under copyright law, even when its branding is similar to that of a blocked domain.</p>
				<p>Reaching a middle ground, the Judge offered a compromise whereby copyright holders can make further applications in the proceeding to extend existing orders to include new target &ldquo;online locations&rdquo; that appear to be associated with already blocked &ldquo;online locations&rdquo;, providing the former makes available substantially the same content as the latter.</p>
				<p>If there are no objections filed by ISPs or site operators, the Court will consider the application.</p>
				<p>The list of domains to be blocked in the first instance reads as follows:</p>

			<p><b><i>Starlink: 1880 satellites in orbit <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/12/20/starlink-1880-satellites-in-orbit/<br>
			</p>
			<p>December 18th saw two SpaceX launches; the first, from California saw the successful launch of an additional 52 Starlink satellites from the Vandenberg Airforce Base, meaning that Elon Musk&rsquo;s broadband constellation now has some 1880 satellites in orbit, and mostly working.</p>
			<p>The second, from SpaceX&rsquo;s traditional launch site in Florida, saw the successful placing of Turksat 5B into its own electrical orbit raising to a final destination of 42 degrees East. This was the first time two Falcon 9 rockets were launched on the same day.</p>
			<p>The California flight was the 28th Falcon 9 mission for SpaceX so far in 2021, setting a new company record for the largest number of rocket launches in a year. (That record was previously set in 2020, with SpaceX launching 26 Falcon 9 rockets.) The launch used the Falcon 9 booster for the 11th time, another record.</p>
			<p>The Florida-launched booster for Turksat 5B also safely returned to its floating landing barge. Another Falcon 9 will launch on December 21st.</p>
			<p>The actual Starlink total satellites launched is far more (at about 1944) but some were de-orbited or failed while in orbit.</p>
			<p>According to Jonathan McDowell, who works at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics and monitors SpaceX&rsquo;s activities and statistics, some 1944 craft have been launched of which 1729 are working, plus the 52 launched on December 17th. But he cautions that there are some which are &ldquo;out of constellation&rdquo; and others where there appears be some sort of anomaly.</p>
			<p>The end result is a Starlink constellation today of some 1467 which are operational &#150; plus last the latest batch &#150; in orbit.</p>
			<p>The first Starlink was launched back in February 2018. The 1600 number of satellites is widely accepted as being key to enable Musk&rsquo;s team to provide global coverage for consumers. But there&rsquo;s still work to be done. Musk has FCC approval to launch 4408 satellites in its Phase 1, and another 7500 satellites (working in the V-band). Then there&rsquo;s another application (with the Canadian government) to provide up to 30,000 satellite using E-band for additional global coverage.<br>

			<p><b><i>Astro taps Kaltura to power standalone streaming service<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.rapidtvnews.com/2021122161786/astro-taps-kaltura-to-power-standalone-streaming-service.html#axzz7FlNjDqde<br>
			</p>
			<p>Leading Malaysian content and entertainment company Astro has chosen Kaltura TV Platform to power sooka, its standalone streaming service offering that is targeted at digital and mobile-first millennials.</p>
			<p>Astro is Malaysia&rsquo;s leading content and entertainment company, serving 5.7 million homes or 73% of Malaysian TV households. sooka offers its viewers a freemium package with a selection of ad-based content that can be expanded into broader content bundles based on multiple subscription plans. It delivers live sports events like the Premier League, Euro 2020,&#x202F;Olympics 2020, BWF badminton, NBA, and Formula 1 as well as over 4000 hours of Malaysia&rsquo;s favourite Malay and Asian dramas, movies, and variety shows, with an upcoming pipeline of sooka originals and exclusives.</p>
			<p>sooka went live in June 2021 across Malaysia on web, iOS, and Android mobile devices and was ranked as the number one entertainment app on Google Play within two weeks of launch. The service features a hybrid ad-based (AVOD) and subscription-based (SVOD) business model to encourage increased customer acquisition and convergence.</p>
			<p>Astro is also aiming to take advantage of the benefits of delivering TV from the cloud, with a feature rich, flexible, scalable and resilient platform based on Kaltura Cloud TV technology, along with hosting on AWS.</p>
			<p>Astro is said to have selected the Kaltura TV Platform for sooka following a competitive Request for Proposals (RFP). The Kaltura technology also enables Astro to deliver linear channels, live events and on-demand viewing experiences on web and iOS and Android mobile devices. Another reason cited Kaltura&rsquo;s multiple worldwide reference cloud TV deployments with another facet being the flexibility of the Kaltura TV Platform. This allowed Astro to incorporate multiple business models and payment methods such as Google In-App Billing, and Apple In-App Purchase, with Direct Carrier Billing soon to follow.</p>
			<p>Kaltura delivered its productised cloud solution for sooka in under six months, enabling the service to be live in time to stream UEFA EURO 2020. This resulted in a high-impact debut for sooka, which ranked the number one entertainment app on Google Play within two weeks of launch.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We created sooka as a standalone streaming service offering to capture the digital and mobile-first millennials with a unique value proposition in the face of an increasingly crowded OTT space,&rdquo; said Euan Smith, Astro chief executive officer of pay-TV and group COO. &ldquo;The flexibility of Kaltura&rsquo;s TV Platform allows us to quickly adapt to viewer preferences and engagement models and it supports our business model. Kaltura was able to smoothly integrate the solution into our existing ecosystem, and very rapidly meet our tight timeline.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://tvblackbox.com.au/page/2021/12/20/nine-lock-in-new-five-year-nrl-broadcast-deal/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The best rugby league coverage will remain on Nine, LIVE and FREE, in a five-year deal announced today which secures the broadcast rights to the game from 2023 to 2027.</p>
			<p>As well as five more years of NRL coverage, Nine will remain the exclusive home of two of Australia&rsquo;s most watched sporting events, the State of Origin series, and the Telstra Premiership NRL Grand Final, ensuring all fans of the greatest game on television don&rsquo;t miss a moment of the action &#150; all at a cost of $575 million.</p>
			<p>With a rugby league partnership going back three decades, Nine will continue to work in close collaboration with the NRL to expand the game across linear and digital platforms, while delivering the biggest clashes and more magic moments than ever before &#150; led by an all-star commentary team featuring modern greats like Billy Slater, Cameron Smith, and Johnathan Thurston, lending their dedication to the game and analytical expertise.</p>
			<p>The new broadcast deal will give Nine three additional matches across the season, resulting in more NRL on free-to-air TV, plus new digital rights to offer footy fans a premium viewing experience that cannot be matched.</p>
			<p>And after securing the biggest ever live BVOD audience in Australia for the 2021 NRL Grand Final, 9Now will continue to be the premier destination for live streaming and catch-up viewing, as well as delivering over 100 hours of Nine-produced digital content.</p>
			<p>State of Origin will return to its traditional home of Wednesday nights in three blockbuster interstate clashes and Nine will continue to cement its commitment to the women&rsquo;s game with expanded broadcast, digital offerings and reporting of the NRLW competition.</p>
			<p>Nine - the home of Rugby League</p>
			<p>In addition, Nine has also secured the radio and audio streaming rights, under which matches will continue to be broadcast in Sydney and Brisbane through 2GB and 4BC, extending Nine&rsquo;s NRL reach and aligning TV and exclusive radio rights on 4.00pm Sunday games.  Plus, all Broncos versus Dolphins games will stream live in Brisbane.</p>
			<p>The continued growth of Rugby league is guaranteed as Nine works alongside the Australian Rugby League Commission, the National Rugby League, and the clubs to promote the great game and to help deliver the moments and memories that generations of fans will remember forever.</p>
			<p>Peter Costello, Nine Chairman said:<br>
				&ldquo;This is a major deal for our business to bring this exciting sport to the Australian public across our platforms.  The negotiation has been constructive and in the spirit of partnership across our businesses and we thank the NRL for the positive engagement in the process for an outcome that benefits all Australians and fans of the game.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Australian Rugby League Commission Chairman Peter V&rsquo;landys AM said:<br>
				&ldquo;Today is an exciting day for our fans with the free to air broadcast deal of the NRL Telstra Premiership, NRLW and Ampol State of Origin locked in until the end of 2027. This is more than a broadcast deal, it&rsquo;s a partnership to grow rugby league using all of Nine&rsquo;s media platforms &#150; television, radio and print.<br>
				&ldquo;It was a priority for the Commission to secure the long term future of the game. In doing so it was important to ensure that a long term partnership reflected the Commission&rsquo;s desire to grow the game at all levels, to invest in innovation and to ensure we have a partner that can help grow the game from participation to pathway competitions and premierships.<br>
				&ldquo;I want to thank Nine Chairman Peter Costello and Chief Executive Mike Sneesby for their commitment to rugby league and loyalty to our game, the most watched sport in Australia this year.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Mike Sneesby, CEO of Nine, said:<br>
				&ldquo;We are very pleased to extend our 30-year partnership with the NRL for a further five years. This certainty enables both Nine and the NRL to continue to bring the game live and free to all Australians and to develop the game for the clubs and the broader NRL community.   This is an outstanding result as together we build a strong media partnership delivering quality, and free, NRL coverage for all Australians for the next six years.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Brent Williams, Nine&rsquo;s Head of Sport, said:<br>
				&ldquo;For 30 years, Rugby League has played a major role in the history of Wide World of Sports and we&rsquo;re delighted to be extending our association at a time when the sport is entering such an exciting growth period.<br>
				&ldquo;While Nine will continue to be the exclusive home of the game&rsquo;s biggest events, we look forward to partnering with the NRL to help the continuing growth of the Women&rsquo;s game and to develop targeted grassroots initiatives. We&rsquo;re excited to collaborate with the clubs and players of all levels to deliver new broadcast initiatives and digital offerings across our multiple platforms.&rdquo;  <br>

			<p><b><i>Kacific 'goes all-in on AWS' to scale up broadband internet delivery<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From http://www.voxy.co.nz/business/5/397202<br>
			</p>
			<p>Kacific Broadband Satellites today announced that it is going all-in on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to scale up the delivery of its broadband internet for the rural regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Kacific plans to migrate its IT infrastructure and critical business applications to AWS by 2022.</p>
			<p>AWS has enabled Kacific to reduce time-to-market and to enhance network management by approximately 50% and respond more rapidly to customer requests and needs. These gains in productivity and quality of service, achieved by leveraging AWS technologies like compute, storage, and databases, in combination with Kacific&rsquo;s commitment to providing affordable connectivity, have improved healthcare outcomes, educational opportunities, and disaster recovery capabilities for millions of people living in remote areas of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
			<p>By migrating its IT support systems to the world&rsquo;s leading cloud services provider, Kacific is taking a &quot;cloud-first&quot; approach to provide accessible, high-quality, low-cost broadband internet connectivity enabling it to connect subscribers to its rapidly expanding network.</p>
			<p>&quot;Kacific is connecting nations across the Asia Pacific so that people in rural and even the most remote areas have the same access to information and services as the urban population,&quot; said Kacific Chief Executive Officer, Christian Patouraux. &quot;With AWS, we now have added agility to rapidly scale as demand grows.&quot;</p>
			<p>&quot;We are delighted to support Kacific in its mission to leverage space technologies to help governments and organizations deliver better access to services for its citizens, especially in remote communities,&quot; said Peter Moore, Regional Managing Director for Public Sector, Asia Pacific and Japan, AWS. &quot;Internet connectivity is fundamental to improving the lives of people globally. By leveraging AWS technologies, Kacific has scaled its services securely to meet customer demand for internet connectivity, bringing the people of our region together.&quot;</p>
			<p>Responding to Covid</p>
			<p>The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of providing citizens with reliable access to the internet, as countries across Southeast Asia and the Pacific entered lockdowns, and the demand and need for critical government information and services, such as healthcare and education, increased.</p>
			<p>Kacific responded by rapidly introducing new products and services, such as GigWiFi and Community WiFi to shape and deliver appropriate and affordable bandwidth plans to over 1,000 healthcare facilities and education premises to support communities affected by the pandemic.</p>
			<p>Working with the AWS for Aerospace and Satellite team of industry experts and using AWS&rsquo;s suite of cloud services gives Kacific the ability to quickly innovate new ways to serve customers. By using AWS, Kacific is able to ensure its operations support systems (OSS) and business support systems (BSS) are able to deliver services to customers quickly and securely.</p>
			<p>Improving information flows to sales channels</p>
			<p>Since the beginning of the global COVID-19 pandemic, Kacific has adapted its business model, engaging a large number of smaller channel partners with a retail franchise model, as it was no longer able to only rely on the highly leveraged model for the typical satellite bandwidth operators. Specifically, Kacific introduced Gigstarter - a pre-packaged, broadband plan offered on a monthly model that is sold plan by plan, site by site via our partners to the end users. This capability enables Kacific&rsquo;s partners to sell residential and enterprise broadband plans without heavy investments into infrastructure or long-term contracts, and gives them the flexibility and scalability at a lower risk. Gigstarter also utilises a strong distribution channel of local, smaller retailers, to access more isolated communities quickly.</p>
			<p>This pioneering retail franchise model required the flexibility and agility for new responsive sales models. By using AWS, Kacific was able to deliver deeper levels of monitoring and reporting, providing these smaller operators with key network information at more detailed and granular levels than before. This, in turn, helped them address end users&rsquo; inquiries regarding customer operations and service quality. Becoming self-sufficient in monitoring their own networks ultimately helped to improve results for their end users.<br>

			<p><b><i>Rabuka calls for public inquiry into Walesi<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.fijivillage.com/news/Rabuka-calls-for-public-inquiry-into-Walesi-f58r4x/<br>
			</p>
			<p>People&rsquo;s Alliance Leader, Sitiveni Rabuka is now calling for a public inquiry into Walesi as he says the unilateral decision to transition all television operators to one singular digital platform is typical of the arrogance of the dictatorial regime.</p>
			<p>Rabuka says Walesi has not tabled audited financial reports in Parliament since it started in 2016 and yet received millions of dollars in grants apart from FBC.</p>
			<p>He asks who is behind Walesi, who is Robert Khan, was there a tender done for all services related to Walesi, were there instances where any party awarded a contract from Walesi had to subcontract and why and how stable is the digital platform.</p>
			<p>Rabuka says he is hearing stories that people that used to get access to TV no longer have access as they need the Walesi set top boxes and UHF antennas. He says even if the set top boxes are given for free for those earning $30,000 or below, people who are already suffering still have to buy a UHF antenna and get the connections done.</p>
			<p>He asks if Walesi will need to spend more money on transmission systems and towers.</p>
			<p>Rabuka also asks who will pick up the bill as it would ultimately be the taxpayers.</p>
			<p>The People&rsquo;s Alliance Leader says this unilateral decision has meant that at a drop of a hat, a publicly listed company like Fiji TV has to abandon and write off whatever it had invested in their transmission systems and move to the Walesi platform.</p>
			<p>Rabuka says we are going backwards if those who used to have television access no longer have access until they spend money.</p>
			<p>Rabuka says unfortunately, this move can only be looked at one way - an attempt to control television transmission in Fiji in a critical year 2022 and we all know what this means.</p>
			<p>We have sent questions to the Communications Minister Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum and Walesi.</p>
			<p>It is not within our means or expertise to inform viewers of the switchover from analogue to digital television - Walesi CEO</p>
			<p>TV broadcasters able to use Walesi free of charge until the first quarter of 2022</p>
			<p>Walesi Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Maharaj says it is important to note that Walesi is a service provider and not a content producer, therefore it is not within their means or expertise to inform television viewers of the switchover from analogue to digital television.</p>
			<p>In a statement released on the Fijian Government facebook page, Maharaj says, however, the company has conducted extensive free installations as well as an extensive media campaign, especially on our social media, together with awareness roadshows to further accommodate the broadcasters and viewers alike, through this transition.</p>
			<p>He says to allow for a smoother transition, this digital switchover is being done in a phased manner, with the first phase applying to the Navua-Korovou region and the Nadi-Lautoka corridor.</p>
			<p>Maharaj adds the rollout programme is ongoing with the second phase of the rollout due for completion by June 2022 across the nation.</p>
			<p>The Walesi CEO says at the present time, Walesi has 21 digital transmitter sites across Fiji and that is already 300% larger than existing analogue broadcast networks with expansion plans in the pipeline for Kadavu, Rotuma and Lakeba.</p>
			<p>He adds 711 free TV sets and Walesi equipment installations have also been done in rural locations which grant over 120,000 people access to the information age.</p>
			<p>Maharaj further says to date, Walesi has completed a two-year process distributing 189,526 Set-Top Boxes and 2,776 satellite receivers which have been distributed Fiji-wide.</p>
			<p>He adds the Fijian Government has also facilitated the provision of TV sets and Walesi equipment in community halls, Government centres, and schools in over 700 communities.</p>
			<p>Maharaj says additionally, over 600,000 viewers are already accessing television through the Walesi App, with more expected to join in the months to come.</p>
			<p>He has revealed that television broadcasters are able to continue using the Walesi platform free of charge until the first quarter of 2022.</p>
			<p>Maharaj says the access tariff is determined by the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission.</p>
			<p>He adds having FCCC mediate between Walesi and the broadcasters has created an independent process and helps everyone involved to ensure a fair outcome.</p>
			<p>Fiji Television Limited says the shutting down of the analogue transmitters in Suva and Nadi is in accordance with correspondence from the Ministry of Communications and is in line with phase one of the Government&rsquo;s planned switch-over process from analogue to digital television, Walesi. FBC CEO Riyaz Sayed-Khaiyum had said the switch over is good for the people as the picture and sound quality will be better. Mai TV Director Stanley Simpson said there are benefits that will come from this switch-over however they would have appreciated a bit more time to do this and any increase in transmission fees by Walesi will severely impact the television broadcast business in the country.</p>
			<p>Following the switchover, some affected residents have shared their concerns with us.</p>
			<p>A resident of Volivoli, Rakiraki was concerned he could not get a TV signal on the Walesi platform to watch the Dubai 7s.</p>
			<p>Gyanendra Sharma said he has a Walesi set-top box and an antenna but he was not able to watch television.</p>
			<p>He says he had bought an antenna for $75 when Walesi was introduced in Fiji.</p>
			<p>37 year old, Maika Tikoilau from Nasau, Koro, Lomaiviti says villagers have been asked to pay for the Walesi agent&rsquo;s travel fare to Koro Island to fix their TV connectivity problems.</p>
			<p>Tikoilau says many of the villagers have their own Walesi set-top boxes and antennas but they are disappointed that they cannot access the Walesi network.</p>
			<p>He says some of the villagers were planning to travel to Suva to buy a set-top box but they couldn't due to the fear of another lockdown.</p>
			<p>Some residents of Naivikinikini in Lami who do not have access to Walesi set-top boxes connected to their home television set are disappointed as they no longer have access to television channels.</p>
			<p>Frances Qounadovu says this was the talk of the town for them as there was no prior notice given about the switch over.</p>
			<p>She says majority of the homes have the Walesi set-top box but do not have the UHF antenna as it is expensive.</p>
			<p>Qounadovu says this has had a great impact on them.<br>

				<p><b><i>mu Space&rsquo;s Reveal On Tech Day A $4 Million Ultra Fast Internet Satellite<br>
						</i></b><br>
					From https://news.satnews.com/2021/12/16/mu-spaces-reveal-on-tech-day-a-4-million-ultra-fast-internet-satellite/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter</p>
				<p>Aerospace manufacturer and satellite internet service provider mu Space Corp, recently announced plans to manufacture up to 200 of its revolutionary MU-B200 satellites that are capable of providing ultra-fast 5Gbps internet speeds to remote locations. With a price tag of US$4 million, less than half that of similar technology currently on the market, the MU-B200 is part of mu Space Corps&rsquo; plans for rapid expansion in 2022. mu Space Corp is an aerospace manufacturer and satellite internet service provider redefining the aerospace landscape in Southeast Asia.</p>
				<p>The organization recently welcomed invited members of the press to the Tech Day Event at its state-of-the-art facility in Bangkok, Factory 1. The event consisted of futuristic space panels, showcases, tech discussions, a tour of the factory and a first-hand experience within the walls of the leading space organization. On top of inviting the press to witness mu Space&rsquo;s plan for the rocket-powered industry, the event enabled the organization to showcase its products.</p>
				<p>Headlining the event was the announcement of mu Space&rsquo;s latest satellite. The MU-B200 is a 200kg customizable satellite that focuses on delivering high power and accelerates performance. It comes equipped with a 1.2 kW high power system, which is further customizable to the client&rsquo;s needs. The price of the MU-B200 was confirmed as $4 Million, with deliveries to be made within 12 months of order.</p>
				<p>The MU-B200&rsquo;s $4 Million price tag is approximately half that of similar products on the market, which range from around $7 &#150; $10 million dollars. mu Space, through its own vertical integration methods, has managed to lower the price dramatically, while cutting the waiting time and hefty associated costs.</p>
				<p>By producing everything in-house, the company can lower cost prices, control quality each step of the way, and customize products as the process progresses. A vertically integrated strategy isn&rsquo;t solely advantageous to mu Space alone, but also their clients. It allows clients to trust that quality is being monitored closely in every process, on top of giving clients the freedom to customize the components to their specifications.</p>
				<p>One key feature of the MU-B200 is its power system, whose efficient design has reduced cost by up to 25 percent, while achieving capacity that is 3.3 times greater than the market today, and a life cycle that is 2.75 times greater. The power system is also equipped with sensors that are able to track its power consumption and control its usage to the most efficient level possible.</p>
				<p>mu Space Corp plans continuous grow within the space industry, evidenced through the company&rsquo;s rapid expansion of production, facilities, and employees. In October of this year, mu Space unveiled plans for Factory 2, the third and largest facility to date. This expansion not only gave birth to more facilities but also allowed the company to scale their production. mu Space Corp has also continuously added to their team throughout this year and has reached 100 employees with plans to have 300 employees by the end of 2022, swiftly putting the company on the map to become a leader in the global space industry.</p>
				<p>With worldwide launch activity having increased by 39 percent over the last decade and the value of the global satellite industry expected to be valued at $508 billion by 2024 according to the Global Satellite Industry Insights &amp; Forecast Report 2020, mu Space Corp&rsquo;s expansion into the market is a signal that Southeast Asia is accelerating its participation in the satellite industry.</p>
				<p>Speaking about the latest MU-B200 announcement, mu Space CEO and founder James Yenbamroong said, &ldquo;I remember the days when we only had one desk at mu Space. Now, we have over 100 employees with plans for 300 by the end of next year. With the addition of Factory 2, our largest facility to date, our eyes are very much to the sky. The focus of the MU-B200 satellite is to provide high performance and high power to all of Southeast Asia and beyond. The higher the power, the faster the internet connection.&rdquo;<br>

			</p>
			<p>SpaceX launched a communications satellite from Florida overnight Saturday for the Turkish company Turksat.</p>
			<p>Elon Musk's rocket firm launched the Turksat 5B satellite aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station during a two-hour window that opened at 10:58 pm.</p>
			<p>Space Force forecasters had predicted only a 20% chance that weather could postpone the launch.</p>
			<p>&quot;The primary weather concern for launch day is cumulus clouds potentially associated with showers in advance of this front,&quot; according to the forecast.</p>
			<p>Another attempt would be made 24 hours later in event of a delay.</p>
			<p>European firm Airbus Defense and Space built the satellite in England and France, with significant Turkish contributions.</p>
			<p>The spacecraft will provide television and Internet broadcast services over Turkey, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.</p>
			<p>SpaceX launched a similar satellite, Turksat 5A, for the company in January. The two satellites use electric propulsion to control their orbits.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/12/17/roku-plays-down-impact-of-us-import-ban/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Roku faces an import ban on some products in the US after the US International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled that the streaming giant had infringed patents filed by Universal Electronics.</p>
			<p>The ITC has banned the import of certain Roku devices including streaming players, TVs, set-top boxes, remote controllers and components that were found to infringe Universal Electronics&rsquo; patents.</p>
			<p>Roku has said that the ruling, which remains subject to presidential review before it comes into force in January, will not have an impact on its ability to sell its products in the US. It said that the ITC verdict confirmed an earlier court ruling that two out the three patents asserted by United Electronics are invalid and that Roku had implemented design changes that remove any infringement of the one remaining patent.</p>
			<p>Joe Hollinger, VP of litigation and intellectual property, said that &ldquo;Roku has already successfully implemented technical design changes that eliminate any infringement of the one remaining UEI patent&rdquo; and added that, &ldquo;based on the ITC&rsquo;s ruling, we do not anticipate any disruption in Roku&rsquo;s ability to continue to import products&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>However, Universal Electronics&rsquo; general counsel Richard Firehammer said that Roku&rsquo;s need to certify that products it was importing were non-infringing would present an unsustainable burden for the streaming outfit.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Importantly, the Commission made clear that Roku would need to certify to Customs, at Customs&rsquo; discretion, that the products Roku wants to import are not infringing and therefore not excluded from entry. We do not believe Roku can meet this burden, and beginning January 9, 2022, any of Roku&rsquo;s infringing products will be subject to exclusion from importation,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>Firehammer said that Roku was continuing to infringe the relevant patent &ldquo;despite its attempts to &lsquo;design around&rsquo; its infringement with recent software updates&rdquo;.<br>

				Tapping into Elon Musk's low-earth orbit satellites<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/127268352/tapping-into-elon-musks-lowearth-orbit-satellites<br>
			</p>
			<p>Kirk Bray of Georges Road Wines happy to pilot a solar-powered connection to an Elon Musk satellite.</p>
			<p>When Kirk Bray is out tramping and sees a row of lights in the sky above, he knows they are the low-orbit satellites he connects to for weather data.</p>
			<p>Bray&#x200B; recently installed IoSphere&#x200B; solar-powered &ldquo;gateways&rdquo; on his vineyard, Goerges Road Wines, to get weather information transmitted from the satellites to him.</p>
			<p>Canterbury-based tech company IoSphere&#x200B; is testing connections with the low-orbit satellite Swarm&#x200B; network owned by Elon Musk&#x200B;.</p>
			<p>The Waipara vineyard is connected to a SenseCAP Orch compact weather station, which captures air temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and light intensity.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get reliable cellular reception out here in the vineyards, and it&rsquo;s always been too expensive to consider satellite services,&rdquo; Bray said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We have just made do with the weather data coming from the Waipara weather station. But that doesn&rsquo;t really capture what&rsquo;s happening in our micro-climate.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The system is powered by a 20-watt solar panel with battery life enough to broadcast weather data overnight and on overcast days, IoSphere chief executive Hamish Hutton said. The weather data is sent over Swarm&rsquo;s low earth orbit satellite network every hour, and goes to a dashboard inside the platform.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It costs US$1000 to set up the satellite gateway, and a $15 monthly charge for access to the satellite network,&rdquo; Hutton said.</p>
			<p>The launch of Swarm&rsquo;s 120 mini satellites was led by former NASA scientist Dr Sara Spangelo in California. The satellites travel at a speed of 28,000km/h and are 500km overhead.</p>
			<p>Hutton said the satellites were positioned like a network of rubber bands stretching around the earth alongside each other as they orbit.</p>
			<p>IoSphere was the first in the world to connect a solar-powered gateway to SpaceX&rsquo;s Swarm&#x200B;satellites, Hutton said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;These solar gateways to the low orbit satellite network are a game changer because it is about a 50th of the cost of connecting to a large, standard satellite,&rdquo; Hutton&#x200B; said.<br>

			</p>
			<p>China has provided its Fengyun meteorological satellite data to 121 countries and regions, including 85 along the Belt and Road, its meteorological authority said Friday.</p>
			<p>Fengyun satellites are a series of remote-sensing meteorological satellites developed by China. Two new satellites launched this year, Fengyun-3E and Fengyun-4B, have already received orders from global users, according to the China Meteorological Administration.</p>
			<p>The country has also offered technical training to over 1,400 professionals from 92 countries and regions.</p>
			<p>Data services and technical personnel training are free of charge to all users, said Xian Di, a senior official with the administration.</p>
			<p>&quot;Global users will enjoy the same treatment in data access as their Chinese counterparts,&quot; Xian noted.</p>
			<p>China plans to launch five more meteorological satellites during the country's 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025) and upgrade to the third-generation Fengyun satellite observation system by 2035, to better serve users along the Belt and Road in disaster prevention and relief.<br>

				Arianespace confirms new rocket debut in 2022 <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/12/16/arianespace-confirms-new-rocket-debut-in-2022/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Arianespace&rsquo;s much-needed new Ariane 6 rocket will be available for launches in 2022.</p>
			<p>Arianespace&rsquo;s CEO St&eacute;phane Isra&euml;l, speaking at the Euroconsult World Satellite Business Week in Paris, told delegates that the giant rocket would make its full test flight in the second-half of 2022. He was not specific as to when. However, there would be a ground-based so-called &lsquo;hot test&rsquo; in the first half of 2022.</p>
			<p>The problem is that the current iteration of the rocket, the extremely reliable Ariane-5 version, which is needed for European Space Agency scientific and government cargoes as well as commercial satellite launches only has 5 rockets remaining in its production manifest.</p>
			<p>Isra&euml;l said that usage of the existing Ariane-5 versions would last for 2022 or early 2023 and that there would be some overlap between usage of the two versions.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;There will be no delay in Ariane 6 because we are now in the very last mile leading to the launch,&rdquo; he told delegates.</p>
			<p>On December 7th the European Space Agency had indicated that the debut launch of Ariane-6 was not expected until about Q3/2022 which was again a further delay for the vehicle.</p>
			<p>Other comments from panellists reminded delegates that Elon Musk&rsquo;s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, as well as Russia&rsquo;s Proton heavy-lift rocket and the smaller Soyuz rocket were available to clients. However, there were anxieties over Russia&rsquo;s potential involvement in the Ukraine would could lead to political challenges for Russia (or Kazakhstan) launches which would create problems for the market.<br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/12/16/rt-launches-rt-de-channel/<br>
			</p>
			<p>RT DE, the latest 24/7 TV news channel from global news network RT, has gone live. The channel, which brings news and views to the German-speaking world, features a mix of live news, debates, documentaries and original programming.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The degree of resistance and hostility with which RT was met in Germany is unlike anything we encountered in any other country or part of the world. At the same time, the German public turned out to be very welcoming. This is evidenced by the immense popularity of RT DE&rsquo;s online and social media platforms &#150; even without the benefit of a full-fledged broadcast TV channel, until now. Going forward, we will do our best to live up to the expectations of our German-speaking TV audiences as well,&rdquo; said Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of RT.</p>
			<p>RT DE programming will be broadcast all over Europe, aiming at countries with sizeable German-speaking audiences: Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and others.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We have found that audiences in Germany are growing ever more interested in RT, and we are happy that now, instead of just reading our content online, they can watch it on TV. Our viewers also want to know what modern Russia is all about, what it looks like on the inside &#150; and we will deliver that as well,&rdquo; said Dinara Toktosunova, CEO of RT DE Productions.</p>
			<p>RT DE is available across the DACH region via its multi-platform offer of satellite broadcast, online and social media. Viewers can likewise access content via the RT app on Smart TVs and all major mobile app stores, as well as across further platforms arriving soon.</p>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://tvtonight.com.au/2021/12/boost-to-4k-facilities.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>NEP Australia expands its 4K HDR facility for live sports coverage.</p>
			<p>Broadcast facility NEP Australia, has launched its second-generation Andrews Hub, capable of 4K HDR broadcasts for Tier 1 live sports coverage.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In 2017 when we launched the Andrews Hub we went to the moon and back in every centralised IP broadcast each day,&rdquo; said Soames Treffry, President of NEP Australia, New Zealand &amp; Japan. &ldquo;Our second-generation Andrews Hub is a story of continued investment and innovation in how we&rsquo;ve built the largest-scale, 4K, centralised production complex on the planet.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Tier 1 sports broadcasting is in our DNA, and it has driven the development of our own control system, &lsquo;TFC&rsquo;, and our &lsquo;anyone, anywhere&rsquo; philosophy,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;And with the launch of the &lsquo;hybrid grip&rsquo; trailer, we&rsquo;ll be reducing our onsite footprint even further, making our services more sustainable again.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Our team are proud to deliver this broadcast leadership to the world.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Foxtel Group Chief Technology and Operations Officer Les Wigan said: &ldquo;As Australia&rsquo;s largest producer of Tier 1 sports, NEP&rsquo;s commitment to innovation and best-in-class solutions makes them a great long-term partner for our business. Their continued investment supports FOX Sports providing our 2.4 million sports subscribers an outstanding viewing experience across Foxtel and Kayo Sports.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>First opened in 2017, the Andrews Hub is part of NEP&rsquo;s growing network of centralised production centres and a global production ecosystem. With its main facilities located in Sydney and Melbourne, and satellite locations, or &ldquo;spokes&rdquo;, in Adelaide and Brisbane, the Andrews Hub has supported numerous clients in producing shows across continents, often thousands of kilometres away from where the match or live event is taking place &#150; even across the Pacific Ocean.</p>
			<p>Demand for remote production began well before COVID-19 when broadcasters realised the benefits of a more efficient and environmentally sustainable approach in which technical producers and directors, replay operators, graphics teams, and on-air talent could all be in different places from where the action was captured. The pandemic accelerated this adoption of centralised and remote workflows as border closures and domestic and international travel restrictions began to severely limit the ability to move crew and talent from one venue to another.As part of its expansion, NEP will build four new control rooms and upgrade its Network Operations Centres to meet increased demand. Work areas for shading and HDR grading of footage before it goes on air will be added, as well as new &ldquo;mini&rdquo; studios and commentary suites for on-screen, off-tube commentary.</p>
			<p>Other advancements include:</p>
			<p>Expanded state-of-the-art facilities using 100% IP, scalable technology, designed to have the lowest possible impact on the environment.</p>
			<p>The introduction of the &ldquo;hybrid grip,&rdquo; a new, all-in-one-style tender/grip trailer with on-board streaming technology built in and ready to hit the road. The single trailer design will include all automated workflows that have made the Andrews Hub so successful, but in a much smaller footprint. As a single trailer only, travel and logistics to move equipment across such a large country becomes more efficient and minimises the carbon footprint for each project.</p>
			<p>NEP will also deploy a new fully integrated and powerful enterprise resource planning (ERP) package to its broadcast control and orchestration platform, making planning and scheduling more efficient and seamless, and enabling more efficient utilisation of equipment across country borders or in different regions.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.space.com/china-kuaizhou-1a-rocket-launch-failure-december-2021<br>
			</p>
			<p>The cause is under investigation, according to state media reports.</p>
			<p>A Kuaizhou-1A solid rocket by Chinese commercial company Expace failed to make it to orbit Tuesday (Dec. 14), taking two commercial satellites with it during its demise.</p>
			<p>The rocket launched from the China National Space Administration's Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert at 9 p.m. EST (0200 GMT or 10 a.m. local time Wednesday, Dec. 15), according to a SpaceNews report, which cited airspace closure notices in pinpointing the launch time. On board the rocket were two satellites for Geespace, which were expected to test autonomous driving navigation assistance.</p>
			<p>Chinese state media confirmed the failure in a news report. &quot;The rocket flew abnormally and the launch mission failed. The specific reasons are being further analyzed and investigated,&quot; read part of a short article that was machine-translated from Chinese.</p>
			<p>Expace did have launch failures in July 2020 (during its first and so far, only launch of the larger Kuaizhou-11) and September 2020 of its Kuaizhou-1A rocket type. That said, the Kuaizhou-1A was on a streak of three successful launches in three months in September, October and November 2021.</p>
			<p>SpaceNews added that Expace's struggles may present opportunities for other, emerging space companies in China to step into the gap and gain experience with launching boosters, while Expace figures out a recovery plan.</p>
			<p>The launch attempt on Tuesday was the 51st reported for China in 2021, and the third failure. Earlier this year, China reportedly beat its national record of 39 launches in a year, which was achieved in both 2018 and 2020.<br>

			<p><b><i>The FAA&rsquo;s 5G C-band bans, explained<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.morningbrew.com/emerging-tech/stories/2021/12/15/the-faa-s-5g-c-band-bans-explained<br>
			</p>
			<p>C-band spectrum is highly favorable for 5G, but the FAA is worried it may interfere with cockpit systems.</p>
			<p>Drones, automation, AI, and more. The technologies that will shape the future of business, all in one newsletter.</p>
			<p>5G&rsquo;s rollout is entering airplane mode.</p>
			<p>Last Tuesday, the FAA set flight restrictions for its pilots over fears that 5G carried over C-band spectrum has the potential to interfere with some cockpit safety systems. The FAA order prohibits pilots from operating automatic landing systems and other cockpit systems commonly used in poor weather, over concerns C-band spectrum could hamper their effectiveness.</p>
			<p>    The agency said it would notify airports that might face potential disruptions and interference in the future.</p>
			<p>AT&amp;T and Verizon voluntarily put their implementation of 5G C-band spectrum on hold to allow more time for the FAA to study the impact the deployment might have on airplane safety. The original timeline was to activate the new wireless service on December 5, but both companies delayed their rollouts to January 5.</p>
			<p>    The telcos also committed to lowering the power emitted from existing 5G cell towers that use C-band spectrum for six months, another precautionary measure to ease FAA concerns.<br>
				    The FAA also says 5G C-band has the potential to interfere with radar or radio altimeters, which measure the distance between aircraft and the ground.</p>
			<p>Telco giants AT&amp;T and Verizon, which collectively spent almost $70 billion in a C-band bidding war in February, in an attempt to catch up to mid-band leader T-Mobile, said the FAA&rsquo;s claims had no evidence.</p>
			<p>    The FCC, which oversees spectrum auctions and generally regulates radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable transmissions, looked into the issue last year and found no evidence of harmful interference with aircraft.</p>
			<p>Uh, what is C-band anyway?</p>
			<p>C-band is all frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum measured between 4 Ghz and 8 Ghz; but the sweet spot of C-band that Verizon and AT&amp;T are buying up is between 3.7 to 3.98GHz. That is used by satellite transmissions, wifi devices, and weather.</p>
			<p>    It&rsquo;s highly favorable for 5G networks because they need broad, directed channels to enable the fast transmission they&rsquo;ve promised.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The thing about mid-band spectrum is that it is very fast, there&rsquo;s a lot of it, and it covers a lot of geography with just a small number of towers. It&rsquo;s called the &lsquo;Goldilocks spectrum,&rsquo; because it has all of those characteristics,&rdquo; Mike Dano, editorial director of 5G and mobile strategies at Light Reading, told Emerging Tech Brew.</p>
			<p>    Most 5G phones carried by Verizon and AT&amp;T in 2021 should have C-band support, including iPhone 12s and 13s, Samsung Galaxy S21 series, the Google Pixel 5, and the LG Wing.</p>
			<p>Big picture: Despite the delay in the rollout, the FCC has kicked some incumbent operators out of C-band. Satellite operators like Intelsat and SES had until Dec. 5 to vacate the spectrum in order to receive incentives from the FCC. Intelsat and SES are set to receive $4.9 billion and $3.97 billion for their troubles, respectively.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/12/15/trai-extends-timetable-for-satellite-gateways/<br>
			</p>
			<p>India&rsquo;s telecoms regulator TRAI has extended its timetable deadlines for would-be satellite operators to establish &#150; and license &#150; their Earth station gateways.</p>
			<p>December 13th was the original closing date for submissions but this has been extended to December 20th. Counter-comments can now be submitted with a January 3rd closing date.</p>
			<p>TRAI, as part of its request, is also seeking suggestions on the &ldquo;operational scope,&rdquo; and associated &ldquo;financial obligations,&rdquo; of such permit, including licence fees, entry fees, bank guarantees and network operation &amp; control centre (NOCC) charges.</p>
			<p>The gateways route satellite data traffic onward either into the Internet or forward onto a satellite.</p>
			<p>However, Elon Musk&rsquo;s 2nd Generation Starlinks are now being built with inter-satellite connectivity. It is also known that OneWeb is planning a similar approach to its next-generation satellites. They are reported to be filing their submissions into TRAI. Also expected to be pitching their ideas are Canada&rsquo;s Telesat and Jeff Bezos-backed Kuiper, and others.<br>

			<p><b><i>Pluto TV extends partnership with Channel 5 in UK<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/12/15/pluto-tv-extends-partnership-with-channel-5-in-uk/<br>
			</p>
			<p>ViacomCBS&rsquo;s free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) service Pluto TV has extended its partnership with the UK&rsquo;s Channel 5 &#150; a sister service also owned by ViacomCBS &shy;&#150; with three new channels to be added to the streaming service in the UK this month, featuring some of the broadcaster&rsquo;s best-loved talent. </p>
			<p>In addition, existing Channel 5 programming on Pluto TV &#150; originally available via My5 Crime and My5 GPs &#150; has been repackaged into two branded channels.</p>
			<p>In all, the suite of five branded channels will significantly expand Channel 5&rsquo;s presence on Pluto TV.</p>
			<p>Channels brought to Pluto TV by the deal include: Cruising with Jane McDonald, Destination Britain, featuring titles such as Britain by Bike with Larry &amp; George Lamb and Walking Britain&rsquo;s Lost Railways, featuring Rob Bell; Building Britain, with range of programmes spotlighting historic and modern triumphs of engineering, including Britain&rsquo;s Greatest Ships, Britain&rsquo;s Greatest Boats, Britain&rsquo;s Greatest Bridges and George Clarke&rsquo;s Build a New House in the Country; and GPs Behind Closed Doors &#150; formerly My5 GPs.</p>
			<p>Finally, My5 Crime will become 5 Cops on Pluto TV, with titles including Police Interceptors and Traffic Cops.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;These new FAST channels from Channel 5 show the potential of Pluto TV for content partners, who can remix and repackage evergreen content to reach fans new and old&rdquo;, said Dan Fahy, SVP Streaming, ViacomCBS UK.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Pluto TV provides content partners with a sophisticated consumer platform, market wide distribution, a proven monetisation model and significant marketing support &#150; this offer is unrivalled in the UK FAST space.</p>
			<p>The launch of the 5-branded channels follows news that the latest season of Star Trek: Discovery, formerly distributed internationally via Netflix, will debut on Pluto TV viewers in the UK, as well as Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland this winter.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The addition of the new Channel 5 channels to the service strengthens Pluto TV&rsquo;s range of local and international programming in way that is compelling to viewers who enjoy the linear streaming experience, while also consolidating Pluto TV&rsquo;s position as the leading FAST player in the UK.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>With more than 54 million monthly active users, Pluto TV has a rapidly expanding global footprint and is currently available in the U.S., the U.K., Europe and Latin America, where the service has seen strong momentum.<br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/12/15/netflix-cuts-india-sub-price/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Netflix, facing a local battle of competition as far as streaming services are concerned in India, is slashing its subscriber rates. The new rates are effective immediately.</p>
			<p>The new rates show some dramatic savings. For example, for viewing on a mobile or tablet (both extremely commonplace and important in the Indian market) it will cost just 149 Rupees (about &euro;1.75) per month &#150; a reduction from 199 Rupees.</p>
			<p>But the largest difference is in Netflix&rsquo;s conventional &lsquo;Basic&rsquo; offering which is a full service option and was priced at 499 Rupees. This is now down 60 per cent to 199 Rupees.</p>
			<p>Higher up the chain, for subscribers to the top-tier and higher-quality Premium plan, the price drop goes down from 799 Rupees to 649 Rupees.</p>
			<p>Media Partners Asia (MPA) say Netflix will have 5 million subscribers in the country by the end of December, following Disney+Hotstar with 46 million and Amazon Prime Video with 19 million subs.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/freeview-cans-on-demand-service-after-tvnz-powerplay/YAC3JWZVBK54VR2NPK5RWP5AOE/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Freeview, the platform co-owned by TVNZ, Three owner Discovery, M&#x0101;ori TV and RNZ, is axing its on-demand service by &quot;late 2022&quot;.</p>
			<p>While its individual members have their own on-demand services in the booming streaming market, former Freeview CEO Jason Foden argued that Freeview On Demand offered a one-stop shop - including the ability to search for a show across all the free-to-air broadcasters' on-demand content.</p>
			<p>But that selling point was undermined mid-year when TVNZ withdrew from Freeview On Demand to focus on its own streaming effort.</p>
			<p>At the same time, departing CEO Kevin Kenrick reiterated that he was open to a paid option for TVNZ - which could follow the pay-to-avoid ads model adopted by Disney-owned Hulu (which aggregates content from US free-to-air broadcasters, as well as producing original content).</p>
			<p>Soon after, Foden quit Freeview. He was recently named to Sky TV's executive as acting chief digital and innovation officer. He moves on to the pay-TV provider's executive this month in a move that coincides with the departure of Tex Teixeira, a longtime lieutenant of former Sky boss John Fellet.</p>
			<p>Sky confirmed last week that Teixeira - whose departure was first tipped by the Herald in October will leave this month.</p>
			<p>The sunsetting of Freeview On Demand continues a shake-up in the local streaming market.</p>
			<p>Last week, Vodafone said it was axing VodafoneTV, which offered Sky's broadcast channels through a wholesale deal, plus third-party apps including Netflix.</p>
			<p>&quot;It's fair to say VodafoneTV didn't reach the customer numbers or scale that we hoped it would, and has been operating at a loss,&quot; Vodafone comms lead Nicky Preston told the Herald.</p>
			<p>VodafoneTV will be turned off in September.</p>
			<p>In a statement, Freeview said it will work with those broadcasters over the coming months to ensure a smooth transition from Freeview On Demand to its owners' various individual apps.</p>
			<p>Freeview product manager Leon Mead was made acting general manager following Foden's departure.<br>

			<p><b><i>A plea to Vodafone&rsquo;s corporate overlords: please don&rsquo;t kill your little black box<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://thespinoff.co.nz/tv/15-12-2021/a-plea-to-vodafones-corporate-overlords-please-dont-kill-your-little-black-box<br>
			</p>
			<p>The wonderful yet doomed VodafoneTV box</p>
			<p>VodafoneTV&rsquo;s days are numbered, the company has announced. Fans of the set-top box believe it deserves a second chance.</p>
			<p>When Edwin Monk-Fromont heard the news, he wasn&rsquo;t happy. A year ago, he shelled out $179.99 for VodafoneTV, a one-stop set-top box that allows users to combine linear TV viewing with many streaming services in one handy package.</p>
			<p>Monk-Fromont had read this review on The Spinoff, decided it was for him, so went ahead and bought one. He wasn&rsquo;t disappointed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been really useful because we moved into a house with a super old dish. It was hard to get linear TV,&rdquo; says the Waiheke Island resident.</p>
			<p>Now, he could catch up on the news and access all of his apps &#151; like Netflix, Neon or Amazon Prime Video &#151; without switching remotes, and with no subscription fee. He could even connect his Sky TV subscription services to it. &ldquo;I love it so much,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty useful.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>On Friday, all VodafoneTV customers received an email announcing some bad news: VodafoneTV is dying, and in nine months, it will be dead. &ldquo;Due to the changing content landscape, VodafoneTV will close on 30 September 2022,&rdquo; the email read.</p>
			<p>Vodafone spokesperson Nicky Preston told The Spinoff that VodafoneTV had been &ldquo;operating at a loss&rdquo; and didn&rsquo;t reach the scale they&rsquo;d hoped. She blames an evolving streaming era. &ldquo;The content landscape has rapidly changed, especially with a proliferation of internet-connected devices on which to view content, from Smart TVs to tablets and phones,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We would rather invest into areas like customer service, network and ICT to provide customers with great connectivity and digital services, instead of continuing to run VodafoneTV as a loss-making service.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Edwin Monk-Fromont couldn&rsquo;t believe it. &ldquo;Gutted is how I felt,&rdquo; he says. VodafoneTV launched in 2017, and received an upgrade to a faster version in 2019. Everyone who uses it seems to like it. The decision affects about 100,000 users, a significant number. &ldquo;I was surprised that they were giving up on it so soon,&rdquo; Monk-Fromont says.</p>
			<p>Like other users who spoke to The Spinoff, he doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s going to do once the service dies. &ldquo;Our TV doesn&rsquo;t have any apps on it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any other options. I think my wife would be genuinely sad to not have it in our household.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He also said: &ldquo;I hope you write an article saying what to replace VodafoneTV with &#151; I need to know what to use next.&rdquo;<br>
				This box is different. Image: supplied</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s a great question, one I can&rsquo;t answer. I, and the rest of my family, are daily VodafoneTV users too. Like Monk-Fromont, I yelled, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; across the newsroom when I got the same email. I want to know my replacement options too.</p>
			<p>Duncan Greive is another. The Spinoff founder authored a review headlined, &ldquo;The last box you&rsquo;ll ever buy for your telly,&rdquo; and described the service as &ldquo;a small, portable, easily setup and relatively cheap device which merges multiple subscriptions, logins and gives you access to linear. If that sounds useful to you, it&rsquo;s well worth the cost of entry.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>To give us all advice, I turned to an expert. Peter Griffin is a technology journalist with decades of experience covering things like this. Yet even he was shocked by the news. &ldquo;I was very disappointed with the news from Vodafone because it really is a very user-friendly device,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If it was a clunky service, I&rsquo;d not be surprised or annoyed, but it actually works really well &#x2026; For the 100,000 people on VodafoneTV it will be a hassle.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Luckily, Griffin has some options. He knows what&rsquo;s out there. One possibility is that if it&rsquo;s time to upgrade your television, you possibly should. &ldquo;The nearest equivalent at the moment is a smart TV with Freeview built into it,&rdquo; he says. You&rsquo;d just need to make sure a rooftop aerial was connected. &ldquo;That will offer live Freeview, Freeview On Demand and recording of shows, with the streaming apps provided as well.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>If that&rsquo;s not financially viable, a SmartVu dongle costing $149.99 could be a good option for some. It lets users stream Freeview channels and use their apps in a similar way to VodafoneTV. One benefit is being able to travel with it. But Griffin warns the package &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t as comprehensive as Vodafone TV&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Also complicating matters is that in the middle of 2022, Sky TV is set to unveil its new set-top box. Those VodafoneTV customers with Sky packages may want to hedge their bets and see if that might be a better replacement for VodafoneTV, Griffin says.</p>
			<p>Everyone spoken to for this story is a fan of VodafoneTV. No one wants it to end. Even Preston, VodafoneTV&rsquo;s communications spokesperson, is a fan. She also confirmed there was no going back on the decision. &ldquo;Wish it wasn&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; she wrote, via email. &ldquo;But sadly the decision has been made.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>She, Greive, Monk-Fromont and I have got until September to figure out which option might suit our future TV-viewing needs best. Until then, we get to use something that already solves all of our  issues. It&rsquo;s called VodafoneTV. &ldquo;It was a great experience while it lasted,&rdquo; sighs Monk-Fromont. He&rsquo;s so right.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
			</p>
			<p>(Craig's comment, I have one of these in my office room, and use it all the time for linear TV with 3day rewind, it works great, its really the only decent IPTV option for Freeview NZ with high quality HD streams. I really hope they find a way to keep it active)<br>

			<p><b><i>Russian rocket deploys Express comsats into high-altitude orbit<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://spaceflightnow.com/2021/12/14/russian-rocket-deploys-express-communications-satellites-into-high-altitude-orbit/<br>
			</p>
			<p>A Russian rocket stage deployed two television and internet relay satellites into a high-altitude orbit 18 hours after liftoff Monday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan aboard a Proton rocket.</p>
			<p>The Express AMU3 and Express AMU7 satellites rocketed into space from Baikonur at 7:07 a.m. EST (1207 GMT) Monday on top of a Proton launcher, running a day later than planned after troubleshooting of a technical issue on the rocket&rsquo;s Breeze M upper stage.</p>
			<p>The 191-foot-tall (58.2-meter) rocket quickly disappeared into a veil of clouds after a vertical climb away from Pad 39 at the Site 200 launch complex at Baikonur. Six RD-276 engines, burning hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide propellants, powered the Proton off the ground with 2.5 million pounds of thrust.</p>
			<p>The first stage detached two minutes after launch, followed by burns with the Proton&rsquo;s second and third stages. A Breeze M upper stage then separated from the Proton third stage on a suborbital trajectory.</p>
			<p>An initial firing of the Breeze M upper stage placed the rocket and its dual payloads into a parking orbit. Four more firings gradually raised its orbit and moved it closer to the equator from the initial path that took the Breeze M stage between 51 degrees north and south latitude.</p>
			<p>The 4,365-pound (1,980-kilogram) Express AMU7 satellite, situated in the upper position of the dual-payload stack, separated first from the Breeze M upper stage at 12:57 a.m. EST (0557 GMT) Tuesday.</p>
			<p>The Express AMU3 spacecraft, with a launch weight of 4,740 pounds (2,180 kilograms), was released by the Breeze M upper stage at 1:14 a.m. EST (0614 GMT).</p>
			<p>Both satellites carry plasma thrusters to circularize their orbits at geostationary altitude more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator about two months after launch.</p>
			<p>Express AMU7 is heading for a position at 145 degrees east longitude, where it will replace the Express A4 communications satellite launched in 2002. Express AMU3 will settle into a geostationary parking spot at 103 degrees east longitude, replacing Express AM3, which has been in service since 2005.</p>
			<p>Both satellites were built by ISS Reshetnev, a Russian spacecraft manufacturer, and are designed for missions lasting at least 15 years. They carry telecommunications payloads supplied by Thales Alenia Space of France.</p>
			<p>Express AMU3 and AMU7 are outfitted with C-band, Ku-band, and L-band transponders. From its more western position, Express AMU3 will cover Central Russia, Kazakhstan, and other parts of Central Asia. Express AMU7&rsquo;s coverage zone is centered on Siberia and Russia&rsquo;s Far East.</p>
			<p>The launch of Express AMU3 and AMU7 was one of few remaining flights confirmed to launch with Russia&rsquo;s heavy-lift Proton rocket. It marked just the second Proton launch this year, following the liftoff of Russia&rsquo;s Nauka lab module in July heading for the International Space Station.</p>
			<p>The launch Monday was just the fourth Proton launch in nearly two years.</p>
			<p>The Russian Express AMU3 and Express AMU7 communications satellites are designed to operate for the Russian Satellite Communications Co., a government-backed enterprise that manages Russia&rsquo;s civilian telecom satellite fleet.</p>
			<p>The new satellites will provide digital TV and radio broadcast services, high-speed internet connectivity, and other data transmission capacity over Russia and neighboring countries, according to RSCC.<br>

			</p>
			<p>MOSCOW, December 14. /TASS/. The Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems Company has taken over control of the Ekspress-AMU3 and Ekspress-AMU7 telecom satellites that were launched from Baikonur the day before, Roscosmos told reporters.</p>
			<p>&quot;Control of the spacecraft was taken over by the company that produced them, the Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems Company,&quot; Roscosmos&rsquo; press service said.</p>
			<p>A Proton-M booster rocket carrying two telecom satellites, the Ekspress-AMU3 and Ekspress-AMU7, blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome at 3:07 Moscow time on December 13. They separated from the booster on Tuesday morning. The spacecraft will employ their onboard engines to raise their orbit, a process that will take from 56 to 59 days.</p>
			<p>The satellites are designed to be used in fixed and mobile telecoms, digital TV, broadband Internet connection, and data transfer in Russia and the CIS in the C, Ku, and L bands. They were launched for the Russian Satellite Communications Company, known also as RSCC and Kosmicheskaya Svyaz.<br>

			<p><b><i>PH to use space tech for wider internet access<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1162728<br>
			</p>
			<p>MANILA &#150; Internet connectivity, especially in rural areas, has been among the challenges faced by many and education sector is among the most affected, prompting the Philippine legislators to push the passage of Public Schools of the Future in Technology (PSOFT) Act.</p>
			<p>The bill seeks to promote the use of technology to deliver quality education, and ensure adequate investment in digital and technological infrastructure for public schools.</p>
			<p>The Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA) has a role to achieve this and will put a spotlight on the space segment of telecommunications and internet infrastructure.</p>
			<p>&quot;Given the rapid advances in space technologies seen globally, it is imperative that the country take necessary steps in building a future knowledge workforce that can contribute to a space-enabled economy. PhilSA will (help) engage DepEd (Department of Education) in developing, enhancing and strengthening relevant SSTA (space science and technology applications) concepts and practice as one foundational technology to be introduced and sustained in the curriculum,&quot; PhilSA Director General Joel Marciano Jr. told the Philippine News Agency on Tuesday.</p>
			<p>PhilSA is a member of the PSOFT Interagency Task Force (IATF) that will develop the PSOFT Roadmap.</p>
			<p>The proposed measure seeks to consolidate the development plans, programs, and projects to be implemented by various departments and agencies of the national government to advance digital technology and innovation in public basic education.</p>
			<p>Among the components of the PSOFT Roadmap is the &ldquo;Universal Access to Internet for Public Schools&rdquo;, which aims that all public basic education schools be provided with internet access to help reduce the digital divide among learners and raise the standards of education for all.</p>
			<p>&quot;In this regard, PhilSA intends to bring to fore relevant space technologies that enable internet connectivity, including solutions and services from new and emerging satellite constellations in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO).</p>
			<p>Earlier, PhilSA launched the INCENTIVISE (Introducing Non-Geostationary Satellite Constellations Test Deployments to Improve Internet Service) project, calling for new Satellite Internet Operators (SIOs) to launch test deployments in selected remote sites.</p>
			<p>Marciano noted that by allowing satellite SIOs to conduct test deployments in the country, government agencies like DepED, the private sector, and the public can experience and assess the performance of satellite broadband internet services for various, such as education, telehealth, disaster response, telecommuting, and e-commerce, among others.</p>
			<p>This initiative is also expected to expand market entry and access to additional internet players that can help bridge the country&rsquo;s digital divide, he added.</p>
			<p>The need to build, use and sustain modern infrastructure for providing accessible quality education is a long-standing one, Marciano said.</p>
			<p>&quot;We emphasize the need and ability to generate and build, and not just to use, relevant technologies, in addressing the effectiveness and sustainability of our socio-economic programs,&rdquo; he added.</p>
			<p>INCENTIVISE project will facilitate the entry and deployment of satellite user terminals and/or gateway equipment, to allow access to LEO and MEO satellites to establish broadband internet connection.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Marciano said PhilSA shall also advise and collaborate with DepEd on the use of space technology and relevant space-enabled services to implement relevant provisions in the Bill. This, he said, possibly includes the generation, processing and use of spaceborne data, satellite images and other geospatial information to support the operations of DepEd in monitoring school buildings or infrastructure.</p>
			<p>Other plans of PhilSA include the regular nationwide baseline assessment of space education in Philippine schools that is expected to underpin collaborative efforts between PhilSA and DepED in infusing SSTA into the curriculum.</p>
			<p>&quot;The subject of space has always fascinated many young people. With the establishment of PhilSA, we intend to work with DepEd in building on this widespread interest in order to increase the number of students in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and to enhance educational outcomes,&quot; Marciano said.</p>
			<p>PhilSA, he said, is offering scholarships to Filipinos to undertake SSTA graduate level studies in universities here and abroad. Expanding opportunities to support educational programs in SSTA at the undergraduate and secondary levels, especially in public schools, is being considered. (PNA)<br>

			<p><b><i>Satellite operators criticize &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; megaconstellation filings<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacenews.com/satellite-operators-criticize-extreme-megaconstellation-filings/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Telesat, which is planning a constellation of a few hundred satellites, is among the operators critical of filings for systems with tens to hundreds of thousands of satellites. Credit: Telesat</p>
			<p>PARIS &#151; Established satellite operators expressed their frustration at the wave of filings for enormous satellite constellations, arguing nations need to step forward and establish rules to curtail such systems.</p>
			<p>The best known of such filings is one by the government of Rwanda with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in September, which proposed two constellations with a combined 327,230 satellites. Rwanda has launched to date a single satellite, a three-unit cubesat called RwaSat-1 in 2019.</p>
			<p>Companies have also made filings for large constellations. Kepler, the Canadian company developing a relatively modest satellite constellation, filed through the German government a proposed system called Aether with nearly 115,000 satellites. The company said Nov. 18 that the figure includes all satellites with an Aether terminal installed, not just the company&rsquo;s own satellites, but the total is far larger than all operational satellites in orbit today.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;My view is, this is what happens when there are no penalties for bad behavior, or behavior not entirely consistent with the way the industry has behaved up to a certain point in time,&rdquo; said Steve Collar, chief executive of SES, during a Dec. 13 panel discussion at Euroconsult&rsquo;s World Satellite Business Week. &ldquo;As a result, we&rsquo;ve got a whole bunch of exuberant filings, most of which won&rsquo;t happen.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;From an economic standpoint, an overcapacity standpoint, these extreme filings do not make any sense,&rdquo; said Michel Azibert, deputy chief executive of Eutelsat. Systems already in active development by companies like Amazon, OneWeb, SpaceX and Telesat, along with high-throughput satellites in geostationary orbit, already provide far more capacity than projected demand, he argued. &ldquo;If you start doubling or tripling the capacity, it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The concern both raised is that some of these proposed constellations do attempt to at least start deployment. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re running the risk of having a totally congested space,&rdquo; Azibert said. &ldquo;The risks of collision are exponential.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He was critical of both the ITU and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, which recently accepted applications for a series of V-band constellations that included a proposal by Astra Space for a 13,600-satellite system. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the ITU being extremely proactive on that. I see the FCC starting something like they are the world&rsquo;s regulator on licensing spectrum in LEO and NGSO in general.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We should not be captured by the hype and say the more constellations the better for mankind, because it&rsquo;s not true. It&rsquo;s the contrary, in my opinion,&rdquo; Azibert said.</p>
			<p>Mark Dankberg, chairman of Viasat, said the issue needs to be taken up at the national level as proposed systems seek landing rights from national regulators. &ldquo;Filings are becoming virtually irrelevant. Even getting a filing through the ITU doesn&rsquo;t really mean anything. What&rsquo;s going to become the big issue is getting landing rights,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the area that we&rsquo;ll start to see reactions where countries realize that granting landing rights to systems that are disproportionately occupying space is just not good for them.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Dan Goldberg, president and chief executive of Telesat, said he shared those concerns even as Telesat develops its Lightspeed constellation. &ldquo;The problem with our industry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is that the ITU doesn&rsquo;t have enforcement powers.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He called for &ldquo;key countries&rdquo; in Europe, Asia and the Americas to work together on this issue. &ldquo;The countries that are ultimately launching these seems to be a logical place for them to come together and introduce some rules that ensure that the risks that we&rsquo;ve been talking about today are addressed and managed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be easy but it&rsquo;s got to be done.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The single biggest problem isn&rsquo;t that the ITU doesn&rsquo;t have enforcement powers. It&rsquo;s that the ITU has zero regulations around orbital congestion,&rdquo; Dankberg said. &ldquo;All they&rsquo;re dealing with is spectrum. Nobody anticipated an environment where there would be so many satellites that the physical congestion of orbits would be a dominant issue.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What happens if all of these constellations try to build? I think we&rsquo;ll have an unsustainable situation very, very quickly,&rdquo; Collar warned. &ldquo;We probably won&rsquo;t realize it until it&rsquo;s too late. Now is the time for the industry to start getting a bit more responsible.&rdquo;<br>

				From https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-12-14/China-sends-new-data-tracking-relay-satellite-into-orbit-15YXUwLnReg/index.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>China sent a new data relay satellite from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province early Tuesday morning.</p>
			<p>The Tianlian II-02 satellite was sent into orbit atop a Long March-3B carrier rocket at 00:09 a.m.</p>
			<p>It was the 401st flight mission of the Long March carrier rocket series. </p>
			<p>Tianlian II is a second generation tracking and data relay satellite developed by the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST). It aims to enhance real-time communication between orbiting satellites and ground control stations.</p>
			<p>Compared to the first launch of the Tianlian II satellite, the current one has improved on the ability to provide multi-user access to communication services and the flexibility to work on orbits at different altitudes. </p>
			<p>The first live-streamed science class from the country's space station also went through Tianlian communication systems. </p>
			<p>The launch of Tianlian II-02 further expanded the capability of China's tracking and data relay satellite system that supports medium- and low-Earth-orbit satellites and crewed spacecraft. China is the second country to have such a system after the United States.</p>
			<p>There are currently seven Chinese data relay satellites in orbit.<br>

			<p><b><i>Report: Decline in turnover of FSS operators <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/12/15/report-decline-in-turnover-of-fss-operators/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Dataxis has published its latest report on the Fixed Satellite Services (FSS) civil communications market. After years of significant growth, the decline in traditional video activity in the most developed countries is being sustained, resulting in a limited but steady decline in the turnover of FSS operators. The outlook for the future is equally becoming more pronounced.</p>
			<p>Among the 45 civil communications satellite operators worldwide, the main players remain SES, Intelsat and Eutelsat. As regards to the operators&rsquo; fleet, a steady decline in new satellite launches can be noted. This naturally impinges on leading satellite platform providers worldwide: while in the course of 2018, 18 satellites were launched, the number decreased to 13 in 2019 and 9 in 2020. This market remains dominated by the Franco-German Airbus Space and the Franco-Italian Thales Alenia Space.</p>
			<p>In the launcher market, the French company Arianespace has maintained a prominent position, although it is facing growing competition from SpaceX. However, since control of space technologies is also a sovereignty issue, several countries, like Turkey with Turkish Aerospace, have developed their own offers to satisfy national demand on top of existing projects from China (CALT) or India (Antrix).</p>
			<p>Dataxis observes that the growth of the FSS market increasingly depends on the development of adapted broadband offers, whether to satisfy retail or backhaul needs. Ka-band capacity is therefore significantly growing for most operators, particularly Eutelsat and Viasat. This approach, however, is being challenged by low or medium-orbit satellite constellation projects, the most emblematic being SpaceX&rsquo;s Starlink. SpaceX&rsquo;s revolution with cheaper and reusable launchers has changed the outlook when it comes to launching several hundred or thousands of satellites swiftly. In addition to Amazon&rsquo;s Kuiper projects, there are initiatives linked to incumbent FSS operators, such as Telesat&rsquo;s Lightspeed, 03B Networks (SES) and Oneweb, in which Eutelsat is also a shareholder.</p>
			<p>It appears likely that historical FSS operators will not be sidelined in the constellation market in the coming years.</p>
			<p>Dataxis has also issued its 2026 forecasts for the global satellite TV markets. It appears fairly obvious that some geographical areas are still very appealing for satellite video, most particularly Africa and MENA, as well as Asia-Pacific.</p>
			<p>As far as one of the growth drivers is concerned, namely broadband, Dataxis reckons that this market will be relatively marginal in Western countries as a replacement or alternative to wireline or mobile offers. Nevertheless, although volumes are limited compared to fiber or 4G/5G, there is still significant growth potential for satellite operators. The capacity available can be filled by a relatively small number of internet subscribers. Additionally, the total number of satellite internet subscribers is relatively small according to Dataxis&rsquo; data and can be further expanded with offers that are more in line with current needs.</p>
			<p>A significant part of the forthcoming growth of civil satellite operators will stem from the maritime and aviation sectors. The need for seamless broadband connectivity now extends to all locations and situations. In the maritime and aviation industries, fixed and mobile operators do not provide adequate solutions, making satellite operators, both FSS and constellation, ideally positioned. The recent acquisition of Inmarsat by Viasat is a striking example of this situation.<br>

			<p><b><i>SES still pursuing Intelsat C-Band share <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/12/13/ses-still-pursuing-intelsat-c-band-share/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Last week, the news emerged that SES had dropped its massive $1.35 billion claim on rival Intelsat for &ldquo;punitive damages&rdquo; over the way Intelsat handled the negotiations with the FCC and the division of FCC &lsquo;incentive&rsquo; payments over the C-Band Alliance.</p>
			<p>The removal of the claim allows Intelsat&rsquo;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy to proceed and cancels a major obstacle within the bankruptcy.</p>
			<p>However, and most Importantly, the removal of the claim does not resolve SES&rsquo;s claims against Intelsat for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duties. Lawyers for SES anticipate that a trial on those claims will be scheduled for early 2022. If SES prevails on its claims, Intelsat will be obligated to make payment to SES in accordance with distributions provisions in the Amended Plan of Reorganization.</p>
			<p>In fact, SES is almost certainly in a stronger position now than it was prior to the cancellation of the $1.35 billion claim in that it can now move its case against three Intelsat businesses: Intelsat SA (which was the original action) and now be widened to include Intelsat License LLC and Intelsat Jackson Holdings.</p>
			<p>The FCC&rsquo;s decision was that its cash would go to Intelsat License which is the formal holder of Intelsat&rsquo;s satellite licences (along with one licence held by [Intelsat] Horizons-3, a joint-venture craft owned by Intelsat and Japan&rsquo;s Sky Perfect JSAT).</p>
			<p>However, at least one legal opinion is that the FCC cash should go to Intelsat SA. But either way, SES can now mount its action against the three key Intelsat businesses in early 2022. SES is seeking an additional $421 million which would make its FCC pay-out match that of Intelsat.</p>
			<p>Perhaps helping matters for SES is that Intelsat has had to make provision for the equalisation pay-out in the current bankruptcy reconstruction under the terms of the agreement with SES. The court, of course, will decide if SES has made a successful argument.</p>
			<p>The formal agreement between SES and Intelsat&rsquo;s lawyers says: &ldquo;Following arm&rsquo;s length discussions by and among the Debtors, SES, and certain of the Debtors&rsquo; other stakeholders, the parties have reached a consensual resolution of the SES Objection&#x2026; By this Settlement Agreement, the Parties, to avoid the cost and uncertainty of litigation, desire to compromise and resolve in the context of the Plan the remaining outstanding issues among the Parties related to the SES Plan Objection.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Russia to launch two Ekspress satellites via Proton-M<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/12/russia-ekspress-proton-m/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Russia&rsquo;s Proton-M rocket will launch a pair of communications satellites Monday, in a rare outing for Russia&rsquo;s heavy-lift launch vehicle. Monday&rsquo;s launch is expected to take place at 12:07 UTC (17:07 local time) from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, with the mission lasting 18 hours from liftoff to final spacecraft separation.</p>
			<p>Proton&rsquo;s payload is made up of Ekspress-AMU3 and AMU7, a pair of communications satellites to be operated by the state-owned Russian Satellite Communications Company (RSCC), also known as the Federal State Unitary Enterprise &ldquo;Space Communications.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Both spacecraft were constructed by ISS Reshetnev, based on the Ekspress-1000N platform, and are bound for geostationary orbit. They have a design life of at least 15 years but are carrying enough propellant to extend this to at least 17 years. While both spacecraft share the same construction, each has a different communications payload suited to its particular mission.</p>
			<p>At 2,150 kilograms, Ekspress AMU3 is the heavier of the two satellites. It carries 39 transponders; 30 of these operate in the Ku band of the electromagnetic spectrum, seven operate in the C-band, and two in the L band. It is also equipped with C- and Ku-band beacons. The AMU3 satellite will be stationed at longitude 103 degrees East, providing coverage over much of Russia as well as Kazakhstan.</p>
			<p>Ekspress AMU7 has a mass of 1,980 kilograms. It also carries 39 transponders; however, only 20 of these are Ku-band, with 18 operating in the C-band and one in the L-band. Only 16 of the C-band transponders are intended for primary operation, with the other two serving as backups, while two C-band beacons and one Ku-band beacon round out the payload.</p>
			<p>From its station at 145 degrees East, it will cover Siberia and far-eastern Russia.</p>
			<p>The satellites are stacked inside Proton&rsquo;s payload fairing, with Ekspress AMU3 in the lower position and AMU7 mounted atop it.</p>
			<p>First flown in 1965, Proton is an integral part of Russia&rsquo;s &#150; and previously the Soviet Union&rsquo;s &#150; fleet of rockets.</p>
			<p>Originally designated UR-500, the rocket that would become Proton was designed by Vladimir Chelomei as part of his Universal Rocket (UR) series. This was intended to give the Soviet Union a range of vehicles with different capabilities &#150; from missiles up to heavy-lift rockets &#150; sharing components and technology across the fleet.</p>
			<p>The UR-500 was conceived as an extremely heavy two-stage ballistic missile, capable of delivering the USSR&rsquo;s largest nuclear weapons to targets around the world. In this role, it never entered service; however, four rockets were used to place heavy N-4 scientific satellites &#150; also known as Proton &#150; into orbit.</p>
			<p>With modifications to the second stage and the addition of a third stage, the rocket was optimized for orbital launches and became the Proton-K. The current Proton-M rocket, introduced in 2001, is a modernized version of the Proton-K but stays true to the original design.</p>
			<p>While the three-stage Proton vehicle can be used on its own to place heavy spacecraft into low Earth orbit &#150; the most recent Proton launch before Monday&rsquo;s having used the three-stage configuration to deploy the Nauka module of the International Space Station in July &#150; it most often flies with an additional upper stage for a four-stage configuration which gives it access to higher orbits.</p>
			<p>For most of its career, Proton was the only Russian or Soviet rocket capable of taking a meaningful payload to geostationary transfer orbit, and it was a popular choice for commercial communications satellite launches from the mid-1990s until the mid-2010s.</p>
			<p>For much of its time in service, Proton was paired with the Blok-D upper stage and its derivatives, such as the Blok-DM series. The Briz-M upper stage, first used in 1999, has largely replaced it, although Proton does still occasionally fly with the latest Blok-DM variant, the DM-03. For Monday&rsquo;s launch, a Briz-M will be used.</p>
			<p>Owing to its heritage in the Soviet missile programs of the 1960s, Proton uses storable unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine propellant and dinitrogen tetroxide oxidizer in all three of its stages.</p>
			<p>This propellant combination ignites on contact, removing the need for complex ignition systems, and allows the rocket to remain fueled for extended periods &#150; a useful quality for a missile that would have to stand watch against unforeseen attacks, but less relevant when it comes to launching satellites.</p>
			<p>These propellants are also extremely toxic and harmful to the environment. Due to this, its advancing age, and reliability concerns, Russia is winding down Proton launches in favor of its replacement, Angara.</p>
			<p>The Angara is a modular rocket that can be used in a lightweight, single-core configuration to place smaller satellites into low Earth orbit or the heavier Angara-A5 configuration to carry larger payloads or reach higher orbits. It is this latter configuration that is expected to replace Proton. To date, the Angara-A5 has flown twice, with a third test launch expected as early as next week.</p>
			<p>Monday&rsquo;s launch is from pad 39 at Site 200 of the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Site 200/39 is the last of the four Proton launch pads at Baikonur to remain operational and is expected to be used for all of the rocket&rsquo;s remaining flights as Russia plans to retire the vehicle by the end of the decade.</p>
			<p>Formerly, a second pad &#150; number 40 &#150; was also used at Site 200, alongside another two-pad complex at Site 81. Unlike other rockets such as Soyuz and Tsyklon, Proton has only ever launched from Baikonur.</p>
			<p>Like most Russian carrier rockets, integration of the Proton is carried out in the horizontal orientation, using facilities at Site 92. Final assembly took place in assembly building 92A/50 before the rocket was rolled to the fueling area for Briz-M propellant loading.</p>
			<p>With this complete, Proton-M was rolled out to the launch pad on Thursday in preparation for a launch which was then scheduled for Sunday.</p>
			<p>A few hours after rollout, the rocket was rolled back to the fueling and preparation site after a potential issue was detected with the Briz-M upper stage. Following inspections on Friday, Proton was returned to the launch pad and the new launch window on Monday was announced.</p>
			<p>Proton-M&rsquo;s first stage consists of a central oxidizer tank with six fuel tanks attached radially. It is powered by six RD-276 engines, one mounted at the base of each fuel tank. Igniting in the final seconds of the countdown, these engines will power Proton through the early stages of flight as it ascends through the dense lower regions of the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. The first stage will burn for just under two minutes before the second stage takes over.</p>
			<p>The second stage has four engines: one RD-0211 and three RD-0210s. These are essentially the same engine except that the RD-0211 contains equipment to help maintain pressure in the second stage propellant tanks.</p>
			<p>The second stage will ignite while the first stage is still firing, a &ldquo;fire-in-the-hole&rdquo; separation technique that keeps propellant settled in the tanks during the transition from first stage thrust to second stage thrust.</p>
			<p>Once the engines are up and burning, the first stage will separate and the second will continue powering the mission forwards.</p>
			<p>Second stage flight will last about three and a half minutes. At the end of the burn, the second and third stages will separate, with the third stage igniting. This stage has an RD-0212 propulsion assembly: the coupling of an RD-0213 main engine with an RD-0214 vernier to provide attitude control.</p>
			<p>The RD-0214 has four combustion chambers which are gimbaled to help steer the rocket while the RD-0213 provides the thrust that will carry Proton towards orbit. The third stage will fire for about four minutes and 15 seconds.</p>
			<p>Although on some missions Proton can insert its third stage and payload directly into a parking orbit, on Monday&rsquo;s launch the third stage is not expected to reach orbit. Instead, it will deliver them to a suborbital trajectory from where Briz-M will take over to complete orbital insertion. The first of five burns using Briz-M&rsquo;s S5.98 engine will set the vehicle up in a parking orbit of 178 by 180 kilometers above Earth sea level.</p>
			<p>Briz-M is capable of making multiple burns in the course of a mission, enabling the complex flights needed to launch to equatorial geostationary orbits from Russia&rsquo;s high-latitude launch sites. The stage consists of a central propulsion module housing the engine, ullage and attitude control thrusters, fuel tanks, and avionics.</p>
			<p>Around this is a detachable torus-shaped additional propellant tank. Propellant from this tank is burned first, and it is jettisoned to save mass once its reserves have been depleted.</p>
			<p>Briz-M&rsquo;s second, third, and fourth burns will come as it crosses the equator at the descending node &#150; in a north-to-south direction &#150; on its first three orbits. These will primarily serve to increase the height of the apogee &#150; the highest point of the orbit. The fifth and final burn will occur when Briz-M reaches apogee during its third orbit. This will raise the perigee &#150; or lowest point &#150; of the orbit and reduce its inclination.</p>
			<p>Seventeen hours and 50 minutes after lifting off from Baikonur, Briz-M will deploy the Ekspress-AMU7 satellite into an 18,714 by 52,872-kilometre orbit at an inclination of 0.26 degrees to the equator. Ekspress-AMU3 will separate 17 minutes later, with the vehicle expected to be in an 18,692 by 52,872 km orbit at 0.29 degrees when this occurs.</p>
			<p>This is a supersynchronous transfer orbit, with an apogee significantly above the satellites&rsquo; operational geostationary orbit at 35,786 kilometers, which helps reduce the fuel the satellites will need to burn to reach their final stations compared to a more typical, lower transfer orbit.</p>
			<p>Ekspress-AMU7 is expected to be on-station, checked out, and ready to enter service within 56 days of launch, while AMU3 is expected to take up to 59 days to complete its commissioning phase.</p>
			<p>Proton&rsquo;s deployment of the two Ekspress satellites marks the 23rd orbital launch of a Russian rocket in 2021 and the second Proton mission of the year. Russia&rsquo;s next launch is currently scheduled for December 23 when the Angara-A5 rocket is due to make a test flight from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome.</p>
			<p>Focus will then return to Baikonur, where Russia&rsquo;s final launch of the year is slated to be made by a Soyuz 2.1b on December 27. The next Proton launch is expected in the first quarter of 2022, with the Elektro-L No.4 weather satellite aboard.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.australiandefence.com.au/news/fleet-space-technologies-to-build-satellite-hyper-factory-in-adelaide<br>
			</p>
			<p>The South Australian Government has announced a new dedicated facility for the rapidly growing space industry &#150; the Australian Space Park. The South Australian Government will invest AU$20million in Australia&rsquo;s first dedicated space manufacturing hub, which will co-locate four space manufacturing companies in a purpose-built facility with a focus on collaboration in the heart of Australia&rsquo;s &lsquo;Space State&rsquo;.</p>
			<p>Following this announcement from the South Australian Government and Fleet Space&rsquo;s recent Series B raise of USD$26.4 million, Fleet Space has announced it will build its new Hyper Factory at the Australian Space Park.</p>
			<p>From the Hyper Factory, Fleet Space&rsquo;s 3D-printed Alpha smallsat constellation will be designed, engineered and manufactured. Alpha, which also integrates beamforming antennas and electronics, will run alongside Fleet Space&rsquo;s existing collaboration with Centuri constellation partner, Tyvak, creating a complimentary constellation that further increases its connectivity speed and reach.</p>
			<p>The Australian Space Park will be the first of its kind in the southern hemisphere. Four companies, Fleet Space Technologies, Q-CTRL, ATSpace and Alauda Aeronautics, will co-locate in the facility with a focus on collaboration and production of small satellites and their payloads, rockets, electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles (eVTOL), and supporting componentry and technical systems.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The creation of the Australian Space Park signals our commitment to the South Australian and Australian space sector by bridging the gap between research and development and prototyping to production at scale,&rdquo; Stephen Marshall, Premier of South Australia said. </p>
			<p>Adelaide Airport has been identified by the industry consortium as an ideal location for the Australian Space Park due to its proximity to traditional aerospace companies and the central business district and innovation precinct, Lot Fourteen, which is home to a growing community of space companies. The State Government is in discussions with Adelaide Airport as a potential location for the Australian Space Park.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The South Australian Government&rsquo;s investment in the Australian Space Park confirms that our home in Adelaide is the true centrepoint of the nation&rsquo;s &lsquo;Space State&rsquo;,&quot; Flavia Tata Nardini, CEO and Co-Founder, Fleet Space Technologies, said. &quot;It also confirms our leaders&rsquo; vision to put the country on the world stage as a global centre of excellence for innovation, design and manufacture of space technology - an ambition that Fleet Space is proud to share.&rdquo;  <br>

			<p><b><i>Rocket Lab launches two BlackSky satellites, wins Synspective contract<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-launches-two-blacksky-satellites-wins-synspective-contract/<br>
			</p>
			<p>WASHINGTON &#151; Rocket Lab launched another pair of BlackSky satellites Dec. 8, a day after the company won a contract from a Japanese firm for three launches of radar imaging satellites.</p>
			<p>A Rocket Lab Electron lifted off from the company&rsquo;s Launch Complex One in New Zealand at 7:02 p.m. Eastern. The rocket deployed its payload of two BlackSky satellites into orbits 430 kilometers high and at inclinations of 42 degrees about an hour later.</p>
			<p>The launch took place just three weeks after another Electron launching from the same site placed two other BlackSky satellites into orbit. The launches are part of a contract, arranged by Spaceflight, that includes a third launch of BlackSky satellites in early 2022.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;These back-to-back missions are a showcase of the benefits of rapid launch in action: quick constellation expansion, streamlined access to space and fast delivery of global insights to BlackSky customers that Rocket Lab is proud to facilitate with dedicated launch on Electron,&rdquo; Peter Beck, chief executive of Rocket Lab, said in a statement after the launch.</p>
			<p>In addition to the Electron launches, BlackSky launched two other satellites on a SpaceX Falcon 9 Dec. 2 as rideshare payloads on a Starlink launch. BlackSky will have 12 satellites in service with this latest launch, which the company says will allow it to provide revisit rates in &ldquo;key markets&rdquo; of six per day.</p>
			<p>This launch was the sixth and final Electron launch of 2021. Rocket Lab had projected a higher launch rate in 2021 but was slowed by both a May launch failure that grounded Electron for two and a half months as well as pandemic restrictions in New Zealand that put launches on hold between that return-to-flight mission in late July and the Nov. 18 BlackSky launch.</p>
			<p>Synspective contract</p>
			<p>The launch took place a day after Rocket Lab announced a contract with Synspective, a Japanese company developing a constellation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites, for three launches in 2022 and 2023.</p>
			<p>Each launch will carry a single StriX SAR satellite, starting with the StriX-&#x03B2; demonstration satellite in early 2022. Rocket Lab launched the company&rsquo;s first satellite, StriX-&#x03B1;, in December 2020.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re honored the Synspective team has once again chosen Electron to grow their StriX constellation,&rdquo; Beck said in a statement. &ldquo;We recognize the importance of dedicated orbits and custom mission parameters for constellations, and we&rsquo;re delighted to deliver a tailored launch and integration service to the Synspective team once again.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>As with StriX-&#x03B1;, Synspective turned to Rocket Lab after delays with another provider. Synspective said in a statement that it had planned to launch StriX-&#x03B2; on a Soyuz rocket through rideshare launch services provider Exolaunch, but a change in the schedule for that launch led it to move the satellite to Electron. In 2020, Synspective moved StriX-&#x03B1; from Arianespace&rsquo;s Vega because of delays after a July 2019 Vega launch failure.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It is a great honor to collaborate with Rocket Lab, which is evolving from a rocket venture pioneer to an experienced launch service provider with the successful StriX-&#x03B1; deployment to orbit,&rdquo; Motoyuki Arai, founder and chief executive of Synspective, said in a statement. &ldquo;We are very grateful for their flexibility in accepting our requests on the satellite&rsquo;s orbit and launch period.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Synspective plans to have six satellites in orbit by 2023, growing its constellation to 30 satellites by the late 2020s.<br>

			<p><b><i>SpaceX links up with Filipino partners<br>
					</i></b><br>
				
				From https://www.bworldonline.com/spacex-links-up-with-filipino-partners/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) is set to roll out its high-speed satellite internet services in the Philippines next year. According to the Speedtest Global Index, our country currently ranks 64th in the world for fixed broadband speed and 72nd in terms of mobile internet speed.</p>
			<p>Bloomberg recently reported that Starlink, a unit of SpaceX, is in talks with two Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE)-listed telecommunication companies to launch its ultra-fast satellite broadband in an archipelago beset by slow speeds and poor connectivity. It identified these two telcos to be Transpacific Broadband Group International, Inc. and Converge ICT Solutions, Inc.</p>
			<p>DFNN, Inc., another PSE-listed firm, was mentioned earlier this year in connection with Starlink&rsquo;s entry into the country. Bilyonaryo.com said DFNN Chairman Ramon C. Garcia, Jr. &ldquo;is serving as SpaceX&rsquo;s go-between with the Senate, which is finalizing its amendments to the Public Service Act.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Starlink uses advanced satellites in a low orbit of 550 kilometers to enable streaming, video calls, online gaming, and other high data rate activities that historically have not been possible with satellite internet. Its potential users can expect to experience download speeds between 100 Mbps and 200 Mbps, with latency as low as 200 milliseconds in most locations.</p>
			<p>Rural communities that have gone unserved by the traditional internet service providers will finally gain access to essential online services and resources through Starlink, including virtual doctor visits and remote learning. Fine examples of Starlink&rsquo;s deployments are the Pikangikum First Nation, an indigenous community in Canada; the Hoh Tribe in Washington, USA; and the Wise County Public Schools in Virginia, USA.</p>
			<p>During disasters, the Starlink team can easily be deployed in a matter of minutes to support emergency responders, especially in areas where connectivity has been unreliable, too expensive, or completely unavailable. Starlink&rsquo;s satellites are also on the leading edge of on-orbit debris mitigation. At end of life, these satellites will utilize their on-board propulstion system to de-orbit over the course of a few months.</p>
			<p>In the unlikely event that the propulsion system becomes inoperable, the satellites will burn up in earth&rsquo;s atmosphere within one to five years &#151; significantly less than the hundreds or thousands of years at higher altitudes.</p>
			<p>Considered as the world&rsquo;s most advanced broadband system, Starlink is presently available in more than 20 countries. Its parent firm, SpaceX, is the only satellite operator with the capability to launch its own satellites as needed.</p>
			<p>If only the Philippine Congress could fast-track the passage of amendments to the Public Service Act of 1936, which would hasten the advent of ultra-fast internet services in our benighted land.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://satelliteprome.com/news/uganda-to-launch-its-first-satellite-in-2022/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The satellite venture will also help improve weather forecasts used by the Uganda Civil Aviation Authority.</p>
			<p>Uganda is preparing to launch its first satellite by August 2022. The satellite, PearlAfricaSat-1, is the latest mission from the Joint Global Multi-Nation Birds Satellite project.</p>
			<p>The project, first announced in 2019, recently took a major step forward with the approval of funding for a ground station near Kampala.</p>
			<p>The station, located at the Mpoma facility where Uganda already has two antennas, will serve as the operations and communications centre for satellites launched by the government and universities. The existing antennas are associated with Intelsat&rsquo;s Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean satellites.</p>
			<p>Uganda has already invested significant resources to develop the technology. The country has committed $2m for technology, research, and development and another $200,000 to improve infrastructure at Mpoma.</p>
			<p>Uganda signed the collaborative research agreement with the Kyushu Institute of Technology (Kyutech), Japan. The agreement involved enrolling and upskilling three graduate engineers to design, build, test, and launch the first satellite for Uganda.</p>
			<p>The core missions for PearlAfricaSat-1 are a multispectral camera payload. The Multispectral Camera mission will provide about 20-metre resolution images for Uganda to facilitate water quality, soil fertility, and land use and cover analysis. The satellite will play a vital role in the oil and gas operation by monitoring the East African crude oil pipeline. This will enable accurate weather forecasts by gathering remote sensor data for predicting landslides and drought. Once the satellite reaches orbit, an Uganda ground station will monitor its health status for a few days before it starts executing its mission.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Roku has settled a dispute with YouTube and will continue to make the YouTube and YouTube TV apps available on its streaming platform.</p>
			<p>Roku had previously rejected what it saw as unacceptable demand from Google for more prominence and more data about usage.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Effective today, we have agreed to a multi-year extension with Google for YouTube and YouTube TV. This agreement represents a positive development for our shared customers, making both YouTube and YouTube TV available for all streamers on the Roku platform,&rdquo; Roku said on Twitter.</p>
			<p>Google had threatened to pull its app from Roku today if an agreement wasn&rsquo;t reached following the months-long dispute.</p>
			<p>The apps were pulled by Roku from their channel store in April.</p>
			<p>Separately, YouTube has published a report commissioned from Oxford Economics highlighting what it describes as the contribution of its creative ecosystem to EU GDP as it attempts to fend off regulatory measures within the European Digital Services Act that it says could have a detrimental effect on the ability of its creators to make money.</p>
			<p>YouTube is particularly exercised by what it describes as proposals that would &ldquo;weaken recommendation systems for online platforms&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>According to YouTube, its &ldquo;creative ecosystem&rdquo; made a contribution to EU GDP of &euro;2.38 billion in 2020 and supported 142,000 full-time equivalent jobs.<br>

			<p><b><i>Rocket Lab to launch three dedicated Electron missions for EO firm Synspective<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Rocket_Lab_to_launch_three_dedicated_Electron_missions_for_EO_firm_Synspective_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab USA has signed a deal with Japanese Earth imaging company Synspective to carry out three dedicated Electron launches.</p>
			<p>The first two missions are scheduled for lift-off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in 2022, with a third to follow in 2023. Each mission will deploy a single StriX satellite, growing Synspective's synthetic aperture radar (SAR) constellation developed to deliver imagery that can detect millimetre-level changes to the Earth's surface from space, independent of weather conditions on Earth and at any time of the day or night.</p>
			<p>These new missions follow on from Rocket Lab's first launch for Synspective in December 2020. The mission, named 'The Owl's Night Begins', saw Rocket Lab's Electron launch vehicle deploy the StriX-a satellite - the first spacecraft in Synspective's planned constellation of more than 30 SAR satellites designed to collate data of metropolitan centers on a daily basis to support urban development planning, construction and infrastructure monitoring, and disaster response.</p>
			<p>During 'The Owl's Night Begins' mission Rocket Lab performed an advanced mid-mission maneuver with its Kick Stage to shield the StriX satellite from the sun to reduce radiation exposure ahead of payload deployment. The Kick Stage will once again perform the maneuver for the new upcoming missions. Flying as a dedicated mission means the StriX satellites will be the only payload on board Electron, giving Synspective control over launch schedule and enabling specific LTANs1 not achievable when flying as one of many satellites on large rideshare missions.</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab founder and Chief Executive, Peter Beck, says: &quot;We're honored the Synspective team has once again chosen Electron to grow their StriX constellation. We recognize the importance of dedicated orbits and custom mission parameters for constellations, and we're delighted to deliver a tailored launch and integration service to the Synspective team once again.&quot;</p>
			<p>Synspective founder and CEO, Dr. Motoyuki Arai, says: &quot;It is a great honor to collaborate with Rocket Lab, which is evolving from a rocket venture pioneer to an experienced launch service provider with the successful Strix-a deployment to orbit. We are very grateful for their flexibility in accepting our requests on the satellite's orbit and launch period.</p>
			<p>Synspective has already begun operating its first satellite and providing solution services, and is now entering a phase of business expansion. StriX-ss, the second satellite following StriX-a, will demonstrate Interferometric SAR (InSAR) technology in orbit and deepen satellite-operation know-how, which are strengths in our business expansion. We will accomplish this mission and steadily achieve results to enhance global efficiency and resilience.&quot;<br>

			<p><b><i>Vodafone to withdraw from television market by axing VodafoneTV<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/127230259/vodafone-to-withdraw-from-television-market-by-axing-vodafonetv<br>
			</p>
			<p>Former Vodafone NZ and Sky TV chief executives Russell Stanners (right) John Fellet launched VodafoneTV amid high expectations in 2017.</p>
			<p>Vodafone will turn off its VodafoneTV service at the end of the September next year, meaning about 100,000 homes will need to find another way to watch television.</p>
			<p>Customers who have bought VodafoneTV boxes costing $179 may get refunds, depending on when they started using the service.</p>
			<p>The move appears to mark the end of Vodafone&rsquo;s once-trumpeted foray into television entertainment.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;For now we would rather invest into areas like customer service, our network and ICT, to provide customers with great connectivity and digital services,&rdquo; spokeswoman Nicky Preston said.</p>
			<p>VodafoneTV lets households on ultrafast broadband watch and record Sky channels and free-to-air TV, and access streaming internet TV services such as Netflix, using a set-top box that Vodafone has been selling for $179.</p>
			<p>Former Vodafone consumer director Matt Williams said in 2017, when Vodafone launched VodafoneTV, that it was a new generation television service that would enable New Zealanders to &ldquo;experience TV like never before&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>But despite positive reviews for its set-top box, Preston acknowledged it had not sold as well as expected.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fair to say VodafoneTV didn&rsquo;t reach the customer numbers or scale that we hoped it would, and has been operating at a loss,&rdquo; she said.</p>
			<p>Preston said about 100,000 customers were using VodafoneTV, which would mean customer numbers would be little changed on 2019 when Vodafone half-owner Infratil said it had a 16 per cent share of the pay-TV market.<br>
			</p>
			<p>VodafoneTV lets customers easily add and remove Sky channels that customers can pay for separately by credit card, and has been a cheaper option for Vodafone broadband customers wanting to access Sky.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Vodafone marketed VodafoneTV as the &ldquo;future of entertainment&rdquo;, but its time will soon be up.</p>
			<p>As the device is fibre-connected it also does not require a satellite dish.</p>
			<p>But despite expectations that the service would be further developed when it launched, it never appeared to be envisaged that VodafoneTV would provide access to content that customers could not instead get directly from Sky, or online using a smart TV or streaming media player.</p>
			<p>Sky plans to launch a new hybrid satellite and internet-connected set-top box mid-next year that will add many of the extras that Vodafone TV currently provides, including support for 4K viewing and integration with streaming services, with the additional benefit of being able to be controlled using voice commands.</p>
			<p>Vodafone commercial director Joe Goddard said retiring VodafoneTV was a difficult decision, but reflected the &ldquo;rapidly changing content landscape&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Vodafone would work closely with Sky to move customers directly on to Sky, or would provide them with advice on &ldquo;alternative solutions such as smart TVs, Chromecast or Freeview,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>The company had given more than nine months notice of the switch-off to help ensure a smooth transition, he said.</p>
			<p>Customers would be contacted by email to &ldquo;provide details specific to their situation&rdquo;, he said.</p>
			<p>Sky TV spokeswoman Chris Major said it was looking forward to welcoming VodafoneTV customers to Sky.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Our strategy is to be the preferred content aggregator in the market, so we will be pleased to have them here,&rdquo; she said.</p>
			<p>Vodafone has been advertising its VodafoneTV boxes on its website up until Thursday, but with a notification they are &ldquo;out of stock&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Preston said customers who had bought the devices might be entitled to a refund &ldquo;depending on when they purchased and activated&rdquo; the service.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;If this is the case, we'll be in touch directly with those people in the next few months,&rdquo; she said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re asking customers to please not go back to the retail store they purchased their VodafoneTV from, as they&rsquo;ll be unable to help &#150; and we&rsquo;ll be handling all parts of this process directly.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Vodafone earlier this year withdrew Tbox set-top boxes that ran off its cable broadband networks in Wellington and Christchurch, moving some of those 6500 customers to Vodafone TV and helping others sign up directly with Sky.</p>
			<p>That means some Vodafone customers will now be facing their second technology switch in less than two years.<br>

			</p>
			<p>The opening day of Intelsat&rsquo;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy exit plan Confirmation Hearing saw Judge Keith Phillips&rsquo; hear explanations from Steven Serajeddini, one of Intelsat&rsquo;s lawyers, that SES would scrap its demand for Intelsat to pay &ldquo;punitive damages&rdquo; to SES of $1.35 billion (&euro;1.19bn).</p>
			<p>The withdrawal of the claim means that Intelsat, as its part of the agreement, would modify how its assets are distributed once a bankruptcy exit is approved by the court.</p>
			<p>Intelsat License LLC, as part of the Intelsat family of businesses, is the official recipient of the FCC&rsquo;s incentive payments for clearing key C-Band frequencies. Intelsat License is already due to receive $1.198 billion for the Phase I clearing exercise.</p>
			<p>SES is seeking half of the &lsquo;extra&rsquo; overall $897 million awarded to Intelsat License. However, SES had struck its C-Band Alliance &ldquo;Consortium Agreement&rdquo; with Intelsat US (and not Intelsat License). Now, with the modifications agreed, the Court can permit SES to argue its case for compensation against three Intelsat-related businesses: Intelsat Jackson Holdings, Intelsat License and Intelsat US.</p>
			<p>The proposal before the court is that $950 million is now up for re-distribution and SES can mount a claim for a portion of this sum.<br>

				Inmarsat modifies satellite for UK&rsquo;s GPS <br>

			</p>
			<p>Inmarsat-3 F5, launched back in 1998, is being reconfigured in orbit from its 54 degrees West location to serve the UK&rsquo;s global positioning system. The UK, because of Brexit, is officially unable to access the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) system.</p>
			<p>The modification will have the result of focusing the satellite&rsquo;s beams to provide more accuracy &#150; of a few centimetres &#150; rather than the few metres available prior to the reconfiguration.</p>
			<p>Inmarsat says the tighter signals will commence by the end of March next year. The work is being funded by the UK&rsquo;s Space Agency.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This new national capability supported by current and future Inmarsat satellites could offer a new option for high-integrity, precision navigation across the country, in its airspace and within surrounding waters,&rdquo; says Inmarsat.</p>
			<p>Inmarsat adds that the project will &ldquo;extend the long life&rdquo; of the satellite, saying the partnership has all the assets needed to activate the system in a &ldquo;very short timeframe&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This work also has the potential to be exported to other nations around the world, benefiting the UK economically as well as technologically,&rdquo; says Nick Shave, VP/strategic programmes for Inmarsat&rsquo;s Global Government division.<br>

				Forecast: 1,700 satellites to be launched annually <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/12/08/forecast-1700-satellites-to-be-launched-annually/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Paris-based analysts Euroconsult say that over the remaining years of this decade to 2030 there will be an average of 1,700 satellites launched each year. The numbers reflect a four-fold increase in numbers (although only a doubling in terms of mass).</p>
			<p>Euroconsult says the race is heating up to rapidly deploy commercial mega constellations for broadband communications and new constellations for real time observation of the Earth. Historical space powers invest in new satellite applications (e.g., Space Security Awareness) and a growing number of countries invest in their first operational satellite system, either for telecommunications, imagery intelligence, or space exploration.</p>
			<p>The new edition of Euroconsult&rsquo;s satellite market forecast assessed individually about 170 constellation projects, of which 110 are from commercial companies. While OneWeb, Starlink, Gwo Wang, Kuiper and Lightspeed will represent 58% of the 17,000 satellites to be launched, they will account for only 10 percent of the satellite manufacturing and launch revenues of the space industry. The report identifies two reasons combining to explain this difference: economies of scale in satellite manufacturing and a strong decrease in launch prices.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Despite a multiplication of commercial constellation projects, only a few place satellite manufacturing contracts, generally with established players. Excluding a few large deals for large constellations and new communication satellites in geostationary orbit (GEO), global competition remains limited for satellite manufacturing. Satellite demand from the governments fuels the competition between local suppliers with still limited opportunities for them to expand internationally (because of national preference in every country where a space industry is established),&rdquo; says Euroconsult.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Despite new business models from new commercial players in space, governments still represent three-quarters of the revenues of the space industry over the decade, i.e., $240 billion. Likewise, incumbent satellite manufacturers continue to dominate the market, with four of them capturing half of the market past decade for a value of $87 billion,&rdquo; the consultants add.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The satellite sector no longer revolves around the axis of New Space entrants challenging established legacy players. Instead, it has now shifted towards speed, and the ability to rapidly provide commercial services from satellite constellations, be it for broadband and/or narrowband communications (e.g. IOT) or for global and real time observation of the Earth. New Space is no longer the driving force in the industry. It&rsquo;s all about Fast Space now,&rdquo; said Maxime Puteaux, Principal Advisor at Euroconsult and Editor of the report.<br>

			<p>India&rsquo;s telecoms regulators recently issued a &lsquo;cease and desist&rsquo; notice to Starlink to stop the SpaceX business from soliciting and taking pre-bookings for the broadband-by-satellite service.</p>

			<p><b><i>Chinese private firm Galactic Energy puts five satellites in orbit with second launch<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacenews.com/chinese-private-firm-galactic-energy-puts-five-satellites-in-orbit-with-second-launch/<br>
			</p>
			<p>HELSINKI &#151; Rocket company Galactic Energy launched its second Ceres-1 rocket late Dec. 6, becoming the first Chinese private firm to reach orbit twice.</p>
			<p>The four-stage Ceres-1 solid rocket lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert at 11:13 p.m. Monday, successfully placing five satellites into a roughly 500-kilometer Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO). </p>
			<p>The launch follows the company&rsquo;s first launch in November 2020, which made Galactic Energy only the second Chinese private rocket firm to reach orbit, following the success of iSpace in July 2019.</p>
			<p>However, iSpace has failed with both of its subsequent orbital launch attempts, both in 2021. Galactic now plans five launches in 2022, the company says.</p>
			<p>Ceres-1 has a diameter of 1.4 meters, a length of about 20 meters with a take-off weight of about 33 tons and has a liquid propellant upper stage. It can carry  300 kilograms of payload into a 500-kilometer SSO.</p>
			<p>Galactic Energy states it has made a number of improvements to Ceres-1 since the first launch, improving the second and third stage engines and introducing carbon fiber composites, boosting thrust-to-weight ratio, payload capacity and overall performance of the launcher. </p>
			<p>Five commercial satellites were aboard Monday&rsquo;s flight. Tianjin University-1 is an infrared remote sensing satellite developed by Changguang Satellite Technology, a Changchun-based remote sensing constellation operator and spinoff from the Chinese Academy of Sciences&rsquo; CIOMP.</p>
			<p>Lize-1 and Baoyun are scientific experiment satellites developed by Changsha-based Spacety. Lize-1 is a test of a new platform and for constellation networking tests, with the involvement of two private companies. </p>
			<p>The roughly 20-kilogram Baoyun carries a GNSS occultation detection payload from Tianjin Yunyao Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., and an intelligent computing platform payload as part of tests for a planned &ldquo;Tiansuan&rdquo; open-source platform constellation for providing LEO broadband and potentially future 6G services, in partnership with Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. The satellite also carries an experiment payload for Beihang University and a Xiaomi consumer camera.</p>
			<p>Golden Bauhinia-5 is a remote sensing satellite developed by Starwiz (Zhongke Xingrui Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd.) for the Hong Kong Aerospace Technology Group Limited (HKATG). The final passenger was the Golden Bauhinia-1 (03) remote sensing satellite developed by Beijing-based ZeroG Lab for HKATG. </p>
			<p>The second Ceres-1 rocket was also sponsored by Ping An Bank, seeing the name appearing on the rocket. </p>
			<p>The successful second launch provides Galactic Energy with the opportunity to establish itself as a reliable launch service provider within China&rsquo;s emerging commercial space sector. Landspace, OneSpace and iSpace have all suffered failures with solid rocket launch attempts.</p>
			<p>The firm has apparently been working on being able to expand on its success so far and ramp up the launch rate.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Galactic Energy is the first domestic private firm to reach a 500-kilometer Sun-synchronous orbit, but it is not an issue of getting into orbit or how high the orbit is which is key to realizing the real industrialization of commercial rockets. It is instead being able to achieve continuous and stable launch of rockets and large-scale rocket production at low cost,&rdquo; Galactic Energy CEO Liu Baiqi said in a post-launch statement.</p>
			<p>The firm is also targeting late 2022 to early 2023 for the first flight of Pallas-1, a reusable kerosene-liquid oxygen launcher. Pallas-1 will be capable of lofting 5,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit or 3,000 kilograms to 700-km SSO.</p>
			<p>Galactic Energy recently assembled the first 50-ton-thrust Cangqiong kerolox engine in preparation for full system testing. Seven Cangqiong engines will power the Pallas-1 first stage, with a single vacuum optimized engine powering the second stage. </p>
			<p>China&rsquo;s private launch firms have yet to make an orbital launch attempt with a liquid propellant rocket. Landspace&rsquo;s methane-liquid oxygen Zhuque-2 could lift off in the first quarter of 2022, according to company CEO Zhang Changwu in a Nov. 18 interview. </p>
			<p>The Hyperbola-2 being developed by iSpace, featuring a reusable first stage, could launch in 2022. However hop tests expected this year have apparently not yet taken place. Space Pioneer and Deep Blue Aerospace are among others also developing reusable liquid propellant launchers.</p>
			<p>The launch was China&rsquo;s 48th of the year and extends the country&rsquo;s new national launch record for a calendar year. The vast majority have been Long March rocket launches performed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp., (CASC), with the exception of the Ceres-1 launch, three Kuaizhou-1A launches and two launch attempts from iSpace.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/12/07/spacex-to-launch-starship-from-florida/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Up until now all of Elon Musk&rsquo;s efforts related to SpaceX&rsquo;s huge Starship rocket have been focussed on its headquarters base in South Texas at the Gulf coastal Boca Chica village, near Brownsville. But Musk&rsquo;s team have now started pouring concrete at Launch Complex 39A at NASA&rsquo;s Kennedy Space Centre part of the Cape Canaveral complex, Florida.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Construction of Starship orbital launch pad at the Cape has begun,&rdquo; Musk said via Twitter. &ldquo;39A is hallowed spaceflight ground &#151; no place more deserving of a Starship launch pad! Will have similar, but improved, ground systems &amp; tower to Starbase.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Musk is sticking to his plan to launch the rocket&rsquo;s first part-orbital test flight soon, perhaps this coming January or February provided he gets Federal Aviation Authority permission to launch.</p>
			<p>Musk has a 20-year lease on Pad 39A from NASA and SpaceX frequently launches its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets from the complex, but the Starship rocket needs new infrastructure.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://news.satnews.com/2021/12/06/ses-phase-1-c-band-transition-aided-by-ussi-global/?mohide=true&amp;mc_cid=b2da34ec39&amp;mc_eid=e80892f101<br>
			</p>
			<p>USSI Global has supported SES in successfully completing all Phase I, accelerated, C-band clearing and relocation activities.</p>
			<p>SES is seeking to clear 280 MHz of the C-band spectrum to help meet the U.S. Federal Communications Commission&rsquo;s (FCC) objective to quickly roll out 5G services across the United States. Phase I required SES to relocate all of its existing services that are received by Incumbent Earth Stations out of the 3700-3820 MHz band. USSI Global made the necessary equipment changes on all associated Incumbent Earth Stations.</p>
			<p>SES selected USSI Global as the primary vendor to help manage and execute the transition of Incumbent Earth Station filtering to mitigate risks of 5G interference. USSI Global served as the lead project management firm and was responsible for outreach, IT systems integration, field support management and status reporting. The initial outreach phase was especially valuable, requiring intensive advance research to gather and ascertain site-specific details of the Incumbent Earth Stations. USSI Global field technicians later provided turnkey systems design, procurement, installation and commissioning of 5G filters and antennas, among other key hardware components.</p>
			<p>To meet the FCC&rsquo;s ambitious Phase I accelerated relocation deadline of December 5, 2021, SES established a goal of clearing greater than 700 Phase I sites by Aug. 31, 2021. USSI Global helped SES successfully meet that goal by supporting approximately 600 Phase 1 Incumbent Earth Station site transitions. The FCC validated SES&rsquo;s Phase I certification on November 24, 2021. By meeting this critical deadline, USSI Global ensured SES was eligible for the first, accelerated, relocation payment.</p>
			<p>USSI Global&rsquo;s more than 35-year history of experience supporting broadcast, network and digital signage services uniquely positions the company as a turnkey service provider for challenging, mandate-driven transitions such as the FCC&rsquo;s C-Band spectrum transition. The company also provides customized post-installation and commissioning managed services, including preventative maintenance and remote monitoring, allowing customers to focus on their business.</p>
			<p>USSI Global has already supported the clearing of more than 100 Phase II sites, and will continue to support SES through the remainder of Phase II clearing and transition activities.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This was an unprecedented endeavor that was conceived prior to the pandemic yet executed during its apex,&rdquo; said Anthony Morelli, COO, USSI Global. &ldquo;USSI Global has an extensive history of developing customized customer solutions to yield effective results no matter what challenges arise. Our dedicated team worked closely and diligently with our partners at SES to adapt to a very challenging environment and achieve our shared goals, with flawless execution overseen by USSI Global&rsquo;s field service leadership.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;USSI Global has extensive experience, which made our partnership for this project a natural fit,&rdquo; said Bronnie Fisher Fiely, Program Management Director, SES. &ldquo;As a core part of their service plan for this project, USSI Global has accomplished a truly superior outreach effort for Phase I and is already hard at work on Phase II.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;As the primary vendor supporting SES, there was a tremendous level of work that had to be completed under tight deadlines,&rdquo; said Dave Christiano, CEO, USSI Global. &ldquo;The USSI Global team&rsquo;s exceptional work went a long way toward ensuring a successful transition for SES, and we are particularly proud of our technicians and field service engineers that implemented the work. We thank SES for trusting USSI Global to get the job done.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/12/06/oneweb-next-launch-on-dec-27/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Russia&rsquo;s Roscomos space agency says that the next batch of OneWeb satellites will launch on December 27th, subject to the usual weather conditions.</p>
			<p>Roscosmos Chief Dmitry Rogozin, talking at the EAEU business forum Space Integration on Decenber 3rd, said: &ldquo;The launch of a Soyuz-2.1b rocket with OneWeb satellites is planned for December 27.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The launch, organised by Arianespace but using a Soyuz rocket, will take place from the Baikonur spaceport in Kazakhstan. It isn&rsquo;t yet known how many satellites the rocket will carry, but the usual manifest is about 34-36 craft.</p>
			<p>Sunil Bharti Mittal, founder &amp; chairman, Bharti Enterprises which is a major shareholder in OneWeb, talking last week said that all the test transmissions to and from the OneWeb fleet have been successful. He commented: &ldquo;Latency is less than 50 milliseconds, and speeds are 100 Mbps or more. So, it&rsquo;s looking like a final solution to connect those people who have been left behind. So I am very excited about this. I call it a telecom network in space.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>OneWeb, he added, is already working on the second version: &ldquo;We have already started to produce a design will have thermal imaging, surveillance, special payloads of the government needs. These will then give you (information about) forest fires, agriculture, issues in the underground rainfall patterns. All these will come in the future generation, which is three, four years away. It&rsquo;s not decades away.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, it has emerged that OneWeb has signed a development agreement with GDC Advanced Technology to create an In-Flight Communications terminal for fitting to aircraft.<br>

			<p><b><i>Two New Satellites Mark Further Enlargement Of Galileo<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From http://spaceref.com/european-space-agency-1/two-new-satellites-mark-further-enlargement-of-galileo.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>Europe's largest satellite constellation has grown even bigger, following the launch of two more Galileo navigation satellites by Soyuz launcher from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana on 5 December.</p>
			<p>Galileo satellites 27-28 add to an existing 26-satellite constellation in orbit, providing the world's most precise satnav positioning to more than 2.3 billion users around the globe.</p>
			<p>ESA Director of Navigation Paul Verhoef comments: &quot;Today's liftoff marks the 11th Galileo launch of operational satellites in ten years: a decade of hard work by Europe's Galileo partners and European industry, over the course of which Galileo was first established as a working system then began Initial Services in 2016. With these satellites we are now increasing the robustness of the constellation so that a higher level of service guarantees can be provided.&quot;</p>
			<p>Soyuz launcher VS-26, operated by Arianespace and commissioned by ESA, lifted off with the pair of 715 kg satellites from French Guiana on 5 December at 01:19 CET. All the Soyuz stages performed as planned, with the Fregat upper stage releasing the satellites into their target orbit close to 23 525 km altitude, around 3 hours and 54 minutes after liftoff.</p>
			<p>The satellites will spend the coming weeks being manoeuvred into their final working orbit at 23 222 km using their onboard thrusters, at the same time as their onboard systems are gradually checked out for operational use - known as the Launch and Early Operations Phase.</p>
			<p>ESA, tasked with designing, developing, procuring, testing, and qualifying the Galileo system and overseeing its technical evolution, recently led an upgrade of Galileo's worldwide ground control segment. This makes it possible for the satellites' LEOP to be run by the Galileo operator, SpaceOpal, from Galileo's own control centre in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, for the first time - rather than requiring an external mission control site. The LEOP operations are being run under the responsibility of the EU Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA).</p>
			<p>&quot;The recent ground control segment update permits mission controllers to oversee more Galileo satellites at the same time,&quot; adds Pascal Claudel, Chief Operating Officer of EUSPA, tasked with managing the Galileo operations and service provision. &quot;This is essential because there are plenty more Galileo launches on the way - Galileo has become a constant world-wide, its continuity and technical excellence established for the long term.&quot;</p>
			<p>The satellites launched today are the first two out of the remaining 12 Galileo first generation satellites, which are an improved version of the existing Full Operational Capability design. Each of these satellites is manufactured and tested by OHB in Germany, with navigation payloads coming from Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd in the UK, incorporating other elements originating from all across Europe.</p>
			<p>Then, in their final stop before heading on to French Guiana for launch, these satellites undergone rigorous testing for spaceflight at ESA's ESTEC Test Centre in the Netherlands, which is the largest satellite test facility in Europe. There are currently six Galileo satellites either currently undergoing testing or stored at the site awaiting transportation to South America.</p>
			<p>All remaining 10 first generation satellites will be launched during the next three years, after which they will be succeeded by the most advanced and powerful, and fully reconfigurable navigation satellites ever built, known as 'Galileo Second Generation'.</p>
			<p>ESA is currently developing these G2G satellites with European industry - sourced from two separate consortia to ensure competitiveness and redundancy - with their first launch scheduled for 2024.</p>
			<p>Matthias Petschke, the responsible Director at the European Commission adds: &quot;Galileo is already delivering metre-scale accuracy everywhere on Earth. The Galileo partners are far from resting on their laurels, however These two satellites will further reinforce Galileo and will - along with other launches to follow - enable novel signals and services, helping to ensure that Galileo retains its first-place status for many years to come.&quot;</p>
			<p>Galileo is currently the world's most precise satellite navigation system, serving more than two billion users around the globe.</p>
			<p>The Full Operational Capability phase of the Galileo programme is managed and funded by the European Union. The European Commission, ESA and EUSPA (the EU Agency for the Space Programme) have signed an agreement by which ESA acts as design authority and system development prime on behalf of the Commission and EUSPA as the exploitation and operation manager of Galileo/EGNOS. &quot;Galileo&quot; is registered as a trademark in the database of the European Union Intellectual Property Office (n&deg; 002742237).</p>
			<p>About the European Space Agency</p>
			<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) provides Europe's gateway to space.</p>
			<p>ESA is an intergovernmental organisation, created in 1975, with the mission to shape the development of Europe's space capability and ensure that investment in space delivers benefits to the citizens of Europe and the world.</p>
			<p>ESA has 22 Member States: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Slovenia, Latvia and Lithuania are Associate Members.</p>
			<p>ESA has established formal cooperation with five Member States of the EU. Canada takes part in some ESA programmes under a Cooperation Agreement.</p>
			<p>By coordinating the financial and intellectual resources of its members, ESA can undertake programmes and activities far beyond the scope of any single European country. It is working in particular with the EU on implementing the Galileo and Copernicus programmes as well as with Eumetsat for the development of meteorological missions.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/12/06/india-dish-tv-denies-bharti-sale/|<br>
			</p>
			<p>India&rsquo;s satellite broadcasting giant Dish TV has firmly denied that it is involved in selling a stake to DTH TV rival Bharti Airtel.</p>
			<p>Local reports had suggested that Bharti was buying a 5.93 per cent stake in Dish TV. Dish, in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange, said it was not aware of any such transaction.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Dish TV India would like to state that there is no information available with the company which is required to be reported under extant SEBI Regulation (Regulation 30), which may have bearing on the stock price of the company. Further, we would also state that the company is not aware of the transaction which has been reported in the above-mentioned news report,&rdquo; said the statement.</p>
			<p>Bharti said it does not comment on media speculation. However, in its formal statement it said: &ldquo;The company (on its own or through its subsidiary companies) evaluates various opportunities of restructurings, alliances/ acquisitions and other similar avenues as per its requirements in the ordinary course of business. As a responsible corporate that follows the highest standards of corporate governance, the Company is fully conscious of its disclosure obligations under SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and is committed to act in consonance with the same.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Perhaps, in other words, it might be said that Bharti was contemplating a move on Dish TV.</p>
			<p>Dish has a 23.45 per cent market share of the Indian DTH market, while Bharti&rsquo;s Airtel Digital has a 25.76 per cent share.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://mumbrella.com.au/90-day-fiance-pop-up-channel-launches-on-foxtel-716568<br>
			</p>
			<p>Discovery ANZ has partnered with Foxtel to announced the launch of a new pop up channel dedicated to reality series 90 Day Fiance.</p>
			<p>The announcement:</p>
			<p>    In celebration of the much-loved TLC series, plus the upcoming brand-new season of the spin-off series 90 Day Fianc&eacute;: Happily Ever After? (Season 6), Discovery ANZ, in collaboration with Foxtel, today announced the launch of a brand-new pop-up channel dedicated to 90 Day Fianc&eacute;.</p>
			<p>    The 90 Day Fianc&eacute; pop-up channel (channel 128) will be live from Monday 27th December and will run until Thursday 6th January, giving Foxtel viewers and 90 Day super-fans the ultimate destination to re-watch every episode of the original 90 Day Fianc&eacute; series &#150; from the very first season through to season eight.</p>
			<p>    90 Day Fianc&eacute; offers a never before seen look into the world of international dating and matrimony. Using a unique 90 Day Fianc&eacute; visa, four people travel to the US to live with their American fianc&eacute;s for the first time. The couples must marry before their visas expire &#150; which is 90 days &#150; or immediately leave the US and return back home. The popular TLC series sees couples have to overcome language barriers, culture shock, the stigma of the &ldquo;Mail Order Bride&rdquo;, skeptical friends and family &#150; all with the 90 day ticking clock starting the moment one of them step foot on US soil.</p>
			<p>    Premiering on Sunday 9th January at 8.30pm AEDT on TLC, after the 90 Day Fianc&eacute; Pop Up Channel, will be the sixth season of 90 Day Fianc&eacute;: Happily Ever After? Having navigated through the K-1 &ldquo;fianc&eacute; visa&rdquo; process, the couples are now married, but they quickly realise that the honeymoon is over as real life sets in. In this brand-new season, we visit some of the more memorable couples to see how they are going after they tied the knot.<br>

			<p><b><i>Walesi UHF Antenna price to be reduced<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.fbcnews.com.fj/news/walesi-uhf-antenna-price-to-be-reduced/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Thousands of Fijians will be able to buy a UHF Walesi Antenna following the Prime Minister&rsquo;s announcement that the price will be dropping.</p>
			<p>Voreqe Bainimarama made this comment while speaking on the Radio Fiji One&rsquo;s Nai Lalakai programme.</p>
			<p>The UHF Walesi Antenna was initially sold at $100 and is currently being sold for $55.</p>
			<p>From the beginning of this month, television broadcasts from Navua to Korovou and from Nadi to Lautoka have switched to the digital platform.</p>
			<p>Viewers need to have a Walesi set-top box for their TV, or a Walesi app on their smart devices to receive services.</p>
			<p>The switch applies to all TV channels in Fiji.</p>
			<p>Bainimarama says to ensure many Fijians receive the Walesi service, free set-top boxes will continue to be given to families whose annual income falls below $30,000 and the cost of UHF Antenna will be reduced further.</p>
			<p>The Prime Minister says to date, Walesi has given out 189,526 set-top boxes and 2, 776 digital satellite receivers.</p>
			<p>He says the government has also assisted several villages with Walesi and free TV in community halls, government stations and schools.</p>
			<p>Bainimarama says the government wants as many Fijians as possible to be able to have access to Television services.<br>

			<p><b><i>TCL: &ldquo;Creating 8K channel pretty easy&rdquo; <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/12/03/tcl-creating-8k-channel-pretty-easy/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The 8K Association followed up the recent announcement of TCL televisions adding The Explorers 8K channel by speaking with Gilles Dassac, CTO at The Explorers, and Aaron Dew, Director of Product Development at TCL North America.</p>
			<p>Dassac says that the natural and human heritage channel now has more than 40 hours of exclusive 8K material available for viewing.</p>
			<p>A stand-out quote from the 8K Association&rsquo;s discussion with Dew was that &ldquo;it was pretty easy to create this 8K streaming service.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We began this effort with The Explorers after we were introduced to them in the 8K Association,&rdquo; said Dew. &ldquo;Once we got to know them, we decided to start a project to use their amazing native 8K content on our 8K TVs, which were still in development at the time. These TVs were planned to use the Roku platform, so we worked with them as well to develop the solution.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The Explorers service was already available on Samsung 8K sets, and for the TCL project, more content was needed, so they have been busy mastering more 8K content that had been shot but not yet finished. Two and a half hours of new content are added per month, and at least as much existing content is re-encoded in AV1 for the new project each month. AV1 was chosen over HEVC for its lower bandwidth and especially its lower decoding processing requirements, more suitable for TV set hardware.</p>
			<p>Dassac pointed out that the advantages AV1 currently has over HEVC also had a downside in requiring about 10x more processing for the original encoding. This expensive overhead is gradually reducing, according to the 8K Association.</p>
			<p>Their internal Open-Source-based encoding workflow is down from the initial four hours, when they started, to just over one hour for each minute of 8K content. As sustainability is a growing issue in the industry, in the short term, it would seem to be greener to encode blockbuster content with AV1 and long-tail content in HEVC. The 8K content is currently encoded at 60Mbps at 30fps with the libaom-av1 multi-pass encoder. Static High Dynamic Range is used for the moment with HDR10, and the Explorers are looking into dynamic metadata solutions for a future upgrade.</p>
			<p>Critical to access the 8K content is internal TV support for decoding of AV1 content.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Support for AV1 decoding was already planned to augment HEVC 8K decoding, so it was important for us to try to bring new 8K content to our customers as well,&rdquo; said Dew. &ldquo;So, to enable access to the 8K content from The Explorers, a channel or app needed to be available in the Roku store for content playback.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The 8K Association says The Explorers already had a channel in the Roku store, but it was not configured to support 8K playback. This task, they say, was the responsibility of Roku, and it mainly involved adding support for the chosen 8K codec for delivery: AV1.</p>
			<p>A recent spat between Roku and Google didn&rsquo;t help matters and is not entirely resolved today.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This clash and other issues resulted in Roku removing the YouTube TV app from its devices. Google then implemented a fix to allow access to YouTube TV via the separate main YouTube app. But the situation remains volatile with Roku&rsquo;s license to the YouTube app set to expire on December 9, 2021,&rdquo; said the 8K Association.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;[But] even if it comes to this, it should not impact the streaming of the 8K Content from The Explorers. Existing Roku customers who already have the YouTube and YouTube TVs apps installed on their TVs or devices should continue to have access, but new access may not be permitted,&rdquo; added the 8K Association.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://7news.com.au/business/fleet-space-to-launch-3d-printed-satellite-c-4805128<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Adelaide-based space start-up's growth strategy released on Friday included the new 3D-printed &quot;Alpha&quot; that it plans to launch next year and an update for its &quot;Centauri&quot; nanosatellites.</p>
			<p>A commercial space race across the Asia-Pacific is launching small satellites from Japan to New Zealand to serve the Internet of Things (IoT) that is made up of billions of devices in homes and businesses.</p>
			<p>&quot;Alpha represents a major step forward and the first time a satellite has been created entirely through 3D-printing,&quot; chief executive and co-founder Flavia Tata Nardini said.</p>
			<p>New techniques for sending wireless signals, known as beamforming, and patented antennas, are expected to unlock high speed connectivity for everything with unlimited data services anywhere, the company said.</p>
			<p>The first Alpha satellites are on track to launch in 2022, with connectivity planned by 2026.</p>
			<p>&quot;This is a clear statement of our intent to become a global leader in space technology, and to support Australia's ambition to lead this critical field,&quot; Ms Tata Nardini said.</p>
			<p>She said their existing Centauri 4 satellite, developed with US aerospace company Tyvak, is among the world's most advanced space communications systems and will be launched by the end of 2022.</p>
			<p>The Alpha is bankrolled by new investment announced last month, including from superannuation fund Hostplus, the South Australian Venture Capital Fund (SAVC) and US venture capital firms In-Q-Tel and Alumni Ventures.</p>
			<p>The world's satellite communications industry is expected to double in the next seven years, driven by cheaper access to orbit, new technologies and more than 14 billion connected devices by 2025.</p>
			<p>The Alpha will be 3D printed at Fleet's manufacturing facility in Adelaide, South Australia.</p>
			<p>Fleet Space has six satellites in orbit as it works towards building a constellation of 140.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://prwire.com.au/pr/100655/mediahub-provides-and-deploys-full-ip-ateme-solution-for-vast-news-service<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Viewer Access Satellite Television service (VAST), is a satellite television platform providing digital television and radio services giving access to a suite of metropolitan-equivalent broadcasting services to remote and rural areas, as well as viewers in terrestrial black spots. Late last year MediaHub was awarded the contract to provide ingest, compilation, playout and distribution of the twenty-one concurrent main and backup news channels, with material ingested from forty record sources across all regional Australian broadcasters. MediaHub, in turn, has now provided a &ldquo;Full-IP&rdquo; Ateme solution for all of Sothern Cross Austereo (SCA) VAST news services throughout Australia<br>
				 <br>
				The federally funded VAST service uses the Optus 10 and Optus D3 satellites and is managed through a joint venture between SCA and Imparja Television.  <br>
				 <br>
				The Full-IP solution provides MediaHub the ability to playout MXF OP1a file-based-only media in a high bitrate SMPTE 2022-6 video-over-IP output format, whilst maintaining first-class video quality alongside audio and caption integrity.<br>
				 <br>
				As part of their rapid transition to becoming a full-IP facility, MediaHub worked closely with Ateme to ensure the initial realisation of this goal using their TITAN and PILOT software range. <br>
				 <br>
				MediaHub CEO, Alan Sweeney, said, &ldquo;Our faith in Ateme and its focused IP centric roadmap has been rewarded with the commissioning of a platform with all the flexibility required as we move into a new era of digital broadcasting with many different delivery points. VAST is the initial deployment in a major project for the balance of our playout platform of over 400 channels. In short, our clients are the ultimate winners.&rdquo;<br>
				 <br>
				Under control of PILOT Media, Ateme&rsquo;s workflow and orchestration system, news content is captured via TITAN Recorder from existing outputs of WIN, Prime, SCA, and Imparja headends. Once captured, the content moves through an automated file-based workflow into the TITAN Playout environment where it is scheduled and played out over SMPTE 2022-6 outputs into the TITAN Live and TITAN Mux headend. <br>
				 <br>
				The PILOT and TITAN platforms are fully virtualised running Docker containers in a Kubernetes environment, enabling MediaHub both future flexibility when considering multi-site redundancy or cloud disaster recovery scenarios, as well as leveraging their expansive common infrastructure platform. <br>
				 <br>
				Beyond an existing strong local support presence, Ateme&rsquo;s distributed 24-by-7 Asia Pacific support team is intimately familiar with the comprehensive TITAN product portfolio. In line with Ateme&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to upholding a customer-centric approach, an extensive training program is underway to gear up the wider support organisation, and to further cement Ateme&rsquo;s technical support presence within MediaHub&rsquo;s operating environment.<br>
				 <br>
				An agile yet formalised approach was implemented to ensure alignment between Ateme&rsquo;s evolving TITAN Playout product roadmap and MediaHub&rsquo;s vision for the future direction of the company.<br>
				 <br>
				Will Munkara-Kerr, Country Manager Australia and New Zealand for ATEME added, &ldquo;MediaHub and the local Ateme team have done an incredible job designing and implementing a cutting-edge solution that maintains the exacting uptime standards required by the critical nature of the service and our industry in general. It&rsquo;s rare to feel a part of such a genuine technological leap forward, and I congratulate MediaHub for their forward-thinking business vision and technical leadership, as well as everyone on our side committed to continuing to realise that vision.&rdquo;  <br>

			<p><b><i>India developing advanced security measures for its satellites<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay?newsID=900148<br>
			</p>
			<p>Chennai, Dec 2 (IANS): India is developing advanced safety and security measures to protect its satellites and neutralise any attack on its satellites orbiting in space, the government has said.</p>
			<p>Answering a question in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, Science and Technology Minister Singh said that the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is developing techniques to protect its satellites against jamming and spoofing, which will be implemented in the future communication and navigation satellites.</p>
			<p>He also said ISRO has implemented fortification measures like strong encryption of commands and authentication protocols in its older in-orbit remote sensing satellites to prevent access to the satellites.</p>
			<p>&quot;To deny information from the satellites (payload and satellite data), measures like directional transmission antenna, transmission of dummy data, switching off information over non-visibility area to Indian stations etc. have been implemented,&quot; he said.</p>
			<p>According to him, more advanced fortification measures like strong encryption of both command and information are planned for the future satellites.</p>
			<p>On the issue of securing Indian satellites from space debris, Singh said the Directorate for Space Situational Awareness &amp; Management at ISRO manages the space assets.</p>
			<p>&quot;The state-of-the-art Space Situational Awareness Control Centre is currently operational at Bengaluru for close approach analysis and assessment of threats to Indian satellites from space debris. It also designs and executes collision avoidance maneuvers whenever critical collision risk is identified,&quot; he said.</p>
			<p>According to him, the ISRO has been following UN guidelines for the mitigation of space debris threats to safeguard Indian space assets.<br>

			<p><b><i>Amagi report: News drives eyeballs &amp; ad dollars on FAST TV <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/12/02/amagi-report-news-drives-eyeballs-ad-dollars-on-fast-tv/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Amagi, a global leader in cloud-based SaaS technology for broadcast and connected TV, has announced the second edition of its quarterly industry report, which reveals that FAST is steadily making inroads into all regions around the world, powered by Connected TV (CTV). The report aggregates data from its proprietary platform, Amagi ANALYTICS on viewership and content monetization trends on top ad-supported platforms across the US &amp; Canada, EMEA, APAC and Latin America.</p>
			<p>While consumers have been shifting to CTV for years, the pandemic led to a significant increase in CTV adoption, giving FAST services a big boost. As of 2021, almost 83 per cent of households in the US have at least one CTV, used by at least one person every month. At the same time, advertisers are shifting their dollars from traditional TV to streaming TV, with marketers estimated to spend over $25 billion on advertising-supported video by 2025.</p>
			<p>Against this background, Amagi&rsquo;s new report unravels the global FAST narrative, also highlighting that news ranks as the top performing genre in the world. The report analyzed QoQ growth of total hours of viewing (HOV) and ad impressions (Q2: April &#150; June 21 vs Q3: July &#150; September 2021) and monthly growth of the two key metrics between April &#150; September 2021, across 1200+ channels on 50+ FAST platforms on Amagi&rsquo;s dynamic ad insertion platform.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;With the undeniable shift to CTV, free ad-supported models have emerged as front-runners in the race for consumer attention and ad revenue,&rdquo; said Srinivasan KA, co-founder, Amagi. &ldquo;For both content owners and advertisers, this means now is the time to monetize premium content through an ad-only business model. The consumer demand is there &#150; and they are telling us they want more FAST platforms and linear channels, rather than on-demand experiences.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Audiences across the world are embracing FAST</p>
			<p>Consumers beyond the US are increasingly savoring free ad-supported linear channels that offer a wide range of content genres. In the US, ad impressions increased by 67 per cent between April and September of this year, and, compared to last quarter, viewership hours were up by 18 per cent. Viewership hours and content monetization on FAST have shown a similar growth trend across EMEA, APAC and Latin America. Clearly, audiences across the world are embracing the new linear viewing experience, as a growing number of content owners deliver their niche content to platforms globally. The steady rise in HOV and ad impressions</p>
			<p>reflects that this market segment is gaining increased stability, serving as a positive signal to content owners and advertisers to invest in this space.</p>
			<p>News stands out as the top performing genre in the world</p>
			<p>Across the world, news continues to be the star performer on FAST channels, accounting for maximum hours of viewing (19 per cent increase from Apr &#150; Sep 2021) as well as ad impressions (33 per cent increase from Apr &#150; Sep 2021). Much of this can be credited to the growing appetite for local storytelling among viewers, especially in the US, where local station groups have found a steady audience stream on FAST. As more and more advertisers cash in on this trend and news content becomes increasingly &lsquo;monetizable&rsquo;, the dominance of the news genre may become a permanent fixture.</p>
			<p>Genre preferences vary by region</p>
			<p>Based on impressions and hours of viewing, the Amagi report reveals different genre preferences across regions. While news is the top genre in the US, EMEA loves the documentary genre. However, in Latin America, movies have garnered maximum viewership while the food genre has attracted maximum ad impressions. Similarly, in the APAC, news is leading with maximum viewership, while music is seeing increased ad conversions. These are interesting trends that can be significant to advertisers in gauging how well they can invest their ad spend on various platforms and genres.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Our report reflects the booming global consumer demand for CTV and free ad-supported models. Clearly, we are seeing growing competition in this universe, in turn leading to a greater demand for data and insights on content and ad performance,&rdquo; added Srinivasan KA, co-founder, Amagi. &ldquo;Through our quarterly industry reports, we hope to offer content owners, streaming platforms and advertisers granular data and sharp insights that help them confidently shape their FAST programming and advertising strategies for sustained success.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>FAST report methodology</p>
			<p>Built on data from the Amagi ANALYTICS platform and dynamic ad insertion platform, Amagi THUNDERSTORM, the FAST report analyzes 1200+ channels across 50+ platforms to explore the growth rate of channels and top performing content genres across four key regions: the US &amp; Canada, EMEA, APAC and Latin America.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Scheduled to launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand during a launch window that opens December 7, 2021 UTC, Electron will lift-off to deploy two BlackSky satellites to low-Earth orbit as part of the company's rapid expansion of its satellite constellation.  </p>
			<p>Rocket Lab USA has revealed its next Electron mission is scheduled to take place during a launch window that opens on December 7, 2021, fewer than three weeks since Rocket Lab's most recent mission on November 18, 2021. These two missions for BlackSky occur 19 days apart and represent Rocket Lab's quickest turnaround in its launch history.</p>
			<p>The &quot;A Data With Destiny&quot; mission for BlackSky managed through global launch services provider Spaceflight Inc., will be Rocket Lab's 23rd Electron launch and sixth mission of 2021. Rocket Lab will not be attempting to recover Electron for this mission.</p>
			<p>Scheduled to launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand during a launch window that opens December 7, 2021 UTC, Electron will lift-off to deploy two BlackSky satellites to low-Earth orbit as part of the company's rapid expansion of its satellite constellation.</p>
			<p>BlackSky combines high-resolution images captured by its constellation of small satellites with its proprietary Spectra AI analytics and insights platform to government customers and industries including transportation, infrastructure, land use, and supply chain management.</p>
			<p>BlackSky expects to achieve a 12 satellite constellation by the end of 2021, with a further pair of satellites scheduled to launch on Electron early in 2022.</p>
			<p>&quot;A Data With Destiny&quot; is the latest in a multi-launch agreement on Electron for BlackSky and Spaceflight that follows the successful dedicated launch of &quot;Love At First Insight&quot; on November 18, 2021 and a successful rideshare mission including BlackSky earlier in the year.</p>
			<p>The &quot;A Data With Destiny&quot; launch is set to bring the total number of satellites launched by Rocket Lab to 109, joining a collection of successfully deployed satellites by Rocket Lab in 2021 from sectors including commercial, civil, and defense that are enabling Internet-of-Things connectivity, providing weather and climate data, and testing next-generation technologies.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Azercosmos has mutually agreed with MEASAT to become the sole operator of the satellite at 46&deg; East orbital slot &#151; Azerspace 1.</p>
			<p>Both parties decided to cement this partnership in place to align with their new, strategic direction in the space market.</p>
			<p>Under the newly signed agreement with MEASAT, Azercosmos will use all of the C-band capacity of Azerspace-1/AFRICASAT-1a to provide satellite services throughout the African region.</p>
			<p>The C-band capacity of Azerspace-1 ensures that Azercosmos will enhance and protect the interests of hundreds of established services and millions of African end-users.</p>
			<p>The company will also ensure the continued seamless distribution of broadcasting, data, video, and audio services to more than 100 million African households as well as the reliable provision of data connectivity in rural areas and emergency situations.</p>
			<p>&quot;Azercosmos is proud to continue its delivery of highly reliable satellites services that enable customers to expand their opportunities in Africa,&quot; said Mark Guthrie, Chief Commercial Officer of Azercosmos.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/11/30/astra-1d-asiasat-3s-go-to-graveyard-orbits/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Research from satellite-watcher Dr. D.S. Kelso at CeresTrak says that the past few days have been busy for the technicians at SES Astra and AsiaSat.</p>
			<p>Kelso says that Astra 1D has been shifted from its geostationary orbit to a higher &lsquo;graveyard&rsquo; orbit as it reached the end of its operational life earlier in November.</p>
			<p>Astra 1D was launched in 1994 and initially served as a back-up for the (then) Astra fleet of 1A, 1B and 1C at 19.2 degrees East.</p>
			<p>Astra 1D has led a rather peripatetic life within the SES manifest and spent time operating at 24.2 degrees East, 31.5 degrees East, 1.8 degrees East, 23.5 degrees East, 52.2 degrees East, 67.5 degrees West and most recently 73 degrees West.</p>
			<p>Overall, it has worked for more some 28 years, despite an initial design life of just 12 years. For the past few years, it has been working in an inclined orbit to save fuel.</p>
			<p>AsiaSat 3S was also moved to a higher &lsquo;graveyard&rsquo; orbit earlier in November.</p>
			<p>AsiaSat 3S was launched in 1999 and operated from 105.5 degrees East until 2014. It was moved to 120 degrees East (until 2015), then 150.5 degrees East for two years and finally at 146 degrees East. It was launched with a design life of 15 years and operated for 23 years.<br>

			<p><b><i>Musk: Bankruptcy &ldquo;genuine risk&rdquo;<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/12/01/musk-bankruptcy-genuine-risk/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Elon Musk has admitted in a memo to staff that problems with his massive Starship places SpaceX into a &ldquo;genuine risk of bankruptcy&rdquo;. SpaceX has let go a number of senior executives, adding that development work on the crucial Raptor engines has created a &ldquo;disaster&rdquo; for the company.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The Raptor production crisis is much worse than it had seemed a few weeks ago. As we have dug into the issues following the exiting of prior senior management, they have unfortunately turned out to be far more severe than was reported. There is no way to sugarcoat this,&rdquo; Musk said in his note to staff.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We face genuine risk of bankruptcy if we cannot achieve a Starship flight rate of at least once every two weeks next year,&rdquo; he said in the memo, which was sent before this past weekend&rsquo;s Thanksgiving holiday, and appealed to staff to abandon Thanksgiving plans and to turn up for work.</p>
			<p>The Starship rocket is needed to launch in extra-large numbers the SpaceX &lsquo;Starlink&rsquo; broadband satellites. A batch of more than 50 will be orbited today (December 1st) using a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
			<p>Tim Farrar, of TMF Associates, responded to the Musk news by putting out a series of stinging Tweets about Elon Musk and his two key projects: the Starlink broadband by satellite scheme and also the SpaceX massive Starship-to-Mars aim.</p>
			<p>Farrar, a highly-regarded industry analyst, tweeted on November 30 that Musk&rsquo;s plan to launch two Starships each week next year &ldquo;is not going to happen&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>He added: &ldquo;And we are probably a year away from having [Starlink Version 2] FCC approval, and it will take well over a year to finish off the 4400 V1 constellation [of Starlink craft].&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The suggestion that &ldquo;Starlink will deliver universal coverage as a matter of course&rdquo; is false. Not only is there a severe lack of capacity (which can&rsquo;t just be addressed by more satellites given the spectrum re-use limits) but any house with tall trees to the north is screwed,&rdquo; he states bluntly.</p>
			<p>Farrar explains: &ldquo;If you are planning to produce &lsquo;several million&rsquo; [Starlink] terminals per year, that implies a steady state subscriber base of ~10M subs from 30,000 Version 2 satellites. Current V1 capacity (with fewer subscribers per sat since Ku-band only and ~1500 usable satellites) likely a few 100,000s. Full V1 CONUS capacity may only be ~500,000 subscribers.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>SpaceX has scheduled tonight (December 1st) to launch another 50+ Starlink satellites into orbit, at 18.20pm Florida time.<br>
				<br>

			<p><b><i>SpaceX readies another 53 Starlinks <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/11/30/spacex-readies-another-53-starlinks/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Barely two weeks since the last Starlink launch (on November 12th) a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is expected to place another (approximately) 53 of its broadband-by-satellite craft into orbit on December 1st.</p>
			<p>With the usual caution of bad weather the launch will take place from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 18.20 pm Florida time.</p>
			<p>The last launch took the number in orbit to some 1844, of which 1699 were working nominally.</p>
			<p>The new craft are understood to be equipped with inter-satellite connectivity by laser, and this extra functionality will enable the satellites to pass internet traffic from satellite to satellite without having to touch the Earth&rsquo;s terrestrial networks.</p>
			<p>Musk has previously said: &ldquo;Inter-satellite laser communications means Starlink can carry data at speed of light in vacuum all around Earth before touching ground. Over time, some amount of communication can simply be from one user terminal to another.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Jail term for pirate software developer <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/11/30/jail-term-for-pirate-software-developer/<br>
			</p>
			<p>In what is understood to be the first conviction of its type in the UK, a man who created and built a software package which enabled illegal access to BT Sport, Sky, Netflix and other subscription television content has been sentenced to two and a half years&rsquo; imprisonment.</p>
			<p>The software package or, &lsquo;build&rsquo; he created was distributed to thousands of users, enabling them to access premium television and film content without payment, and causing potential losses to the legitimate broadcast industry of millions of pounds per year.</p>
			<p>Stephen Millington, from Winsford in the northwest of England, appeared at Chester Crown Court after pleading guilty to multiple fraud and copyright offences, including making and supplying software to enable illegal access to subscription content, distributing infringing film content via a dedicated server he controlled, sharing login credentials for subscription streaming services and illegally accessing content for his own use.</p>
			<p>Millington was the creator of software package &lsquo;stephen-builds&rsquo; which facilitated access to subscription television and film content without payment to the rights&rsquo; holders. He also supplied details of the &lsquo;Supremacy&rsquo; and &lsquo;Supremacy Sports&rsquo; add-ons, which enabled users to access that content via a group he set up and managed on Facebook, in which thousands of members were given instructions and support with use of the add-ons. Millington also created multiple YouTube videos which helped users install the software and add-ons and demonstrated the ability of his &lsquo;build&rsquo; to enable the viewing of subscription television and film content.</p>
			<p>In addition to these offences, Millington shared login details for Netflix, allowing others to access his accounts.</p>
			<p>During sentencing the Judge commented &ldquo;When looking at loss in these types of cases you need to consider not only the companies that create and produce the content but also the loss to those who legitimately pay to subscribe.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;There was sophistication in the way he created the build, clearly planned and it was also clear from the evidence that from his activities, thousands of users were provided with access to illicit content.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The value of the content unlawfully made available is estimated to be in the region of &pound;3.8 million per year, totalling in excess of &pound;10 million during the lifetime of the fraud.</p>
			<p>UK IP protection body FACT worked with BT to identify Millington and referred the case to the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit, who, together with Greater Manchester Police supported the prosecution, which was brought by FACT.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We welcome today&rsquo;s sentencing and hope this sends a clear message,&rdquo; commented Inspector Chris McClellan from the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit. &ldquo;We will continue to work together with our partners to take robust action against those who commit fraud and copyright offences for their own criminal gain.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Enabling illegal access to content is fraud; a crime with serious consequences, as shown in this sentencing,&rdquo; declared FACT Chief Executive Kieron Sharp. &ldquo;It is now clear that the courts will hold those choosing to break the law to account, and will deliver convictions that will have a significant and long-lasting effect on individuals involved.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We thank the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit, Greater Manchester Police and our members BT and Virgin Media for their work and support. FACT will continue to monitor channels used to advertise, market, sell and distribute software, add-ons, devices and streams to take action against suppliers and operators.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Our Anti-Piracy Team regularly carries out investigations against illegal app developers and IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) suppliers,&rdquo; advised Richard Crisp, Corporate Investigations Manager at BT. &ldquo;The development of add-ons that carry unauthorised channels causes a significant loss of revenue for the UK creative industries. BT will continue to work with FACT and wider industry partners to prosecute developers enabling this illegal distribution.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Piracy costs our customers and the creative industries millions of pounds every year,&rdquo; said a Virgin Media O2 spokesperson. &ldquo;We take this criminal behaviour very seriously and support action which prevents the illegal distribution of copyrighted content.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/11/26/oneweb-looks-at-de-orbiting-failed-satellite/<br>
			</p>
			<p>A OneWeb satellite (numbered SL41) orbiting at about 1200 kms, has failed because of a software problem and the satellite operator is looking to de-orbit the craft and is considering how best to remove it from orbit.</p>
			<p>The satellite is the only one of the 358 OneWeb craft to have failed, which is itself an excellent record. It seems the satellite was one of a batch of 34 launched on February 6th last year. The problem occurred, according to OneWeb, with a software issue which occurred as the craft was being raised to its working orbit.</p>
			<p>Chris McLaughlin, OneWeb VP/Chief of government, says that the operator is now looking at how best to handle the de-orbiting. Earlier this year, the company joined an ESA-backed debris removal scheme with Astroscale (participating in ESA&rsquo;s Sunrise project).</p>
			<p>The UK Space Agency is part-funding Astroscale and a Swiss business ClearSpace to the tune of about $1 million to remove two spacecraft from orbit by 2025.</p>
			<p>On November 24th, Astroscale raised some $109 million (in a Series F Funding round), taking its total raised to date to some $300 million. The company says that this will boost its plan to provide in-orbit servicing of satellites by 2030.<br>

			<p><b><i>Indian Government Wants Starlink to Stop Selling Satellite Internet Without a License<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://interestingengineering.com/india-wants-starlink-to-stop-selling-satellite-internet-without-license<br>
			</p>
			<p>The title of the government's release literally reads &quot;Get license before offering Satellite-based services.&quot;</p>
			<p>India&rsquo;s Department of Telecommunications has requested that Starlink stop selling satellite internet services in the country &ldquo;with immediate effect&rdquo; because it does not currently have the licenses to do so. The department also advised the public not to buy Starlink internet.</p>
			<p>&quot;For rendering satellite-based services in India, requisite license(s) from Department of Telecommunications, Government of India are required. It is hereby informed to the public at large that the said company has not obtained any license/authorization for rendering satellite-based internet services that are being booked on their website,&quot; said the government in a statement.</p>
			<p>&quot;Accordingly, the Government has asked the company to comply with the Indian regulatory framework for rendering the satellite-based communication services and refrain from booking/rendering the satellite internet services in India with immediate effect.&quot;</p>
			<p>In July 2021, during a keynote speech, Elon Musk gave at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, the SpaceX CEO announced that, in August, Starlink &quot;should have global connectivity everywhere except the poles&quot;.</p>
			<p>This deadline was at least one month sooner than previously thought. Perhaps that's why Starlink has not had time to get the Indian licenses.</p>
			<p>A company presentation shared by Starlink India director Sanjay Bhargava earlier this month stated that the firm was still &ldquo;in the process of getting approvals to ship Starlinks to India&quot; and added that 100% broadband is an important catalyst for rural development. The presentation also noted that the company was working to identify the 12 districts where Starlinks will be shipped in the 1st phase after the proof of concept.</p>
			<p>The company aims to have 200,000 Starlinks in the country by December 2022. The goal of Starlink internet is to provide a connection to those areas too remote to be connected otherwise. <br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/11/26/t20-world-cup-delivers-record-viewership/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Cricket and sports fans across the world enjoyed unparalleled coverage of the ICC Men&rsquo;s T20 World Cup 2021, when the tournament returned after five years.</p>
			<p>The event, the biggest ever cricket tournament to be staged in the UAE and Oman, broke viewership records in several regions, including garnering a record television reach of 167 million, and a record consumption of 15.9 billion minutes in India on the Star India Network, for the highly-anticipated India-Pakistan clash.</p>
			<p>The encounter is now the most viewed T20I match in history, exceeding the previous high of the India-West Indies semi-final match from the 2016 edition of the ICC event held in India. The overall TV consumption for the full tournament in India was recorded at 112 billion minutes, this despite India&rsquo;s early exit from the tournament. Viewership share amidst younger audiences in India (children below the age of 15) was at a healthy 18.5 per cent at the back of a highly successful marketing campaign &lsquo;Live the Game&rsquo; targeting a younger demographic.</p>
			<p>Digital consumption for the tournament saw an explosive growth on Disney+ Hotstar in India, adding significantly to the overall television viewership in the market.</p>
			<p>In the UK, viewership for the India v Pakistan match grew by 60 per cent on Sky UK whereas the overall viewership for the market went up by 7 per cent. In Pakistan, the event was being broadcast by three players for the first time namely PTV, ARY and Ten Sports, which led to further growth in viewership by 7.3 per cent compared to the 2016 edition of the event.</p>
			<p>In Australia, the viewership increased by 175 per cent on the Fox Network. In the USA, which the ICC recently named as one of the focus markets for the sport, the tournament was the most viewed cricket tournament ever on ESPN+.</p>
			<p>ICC&rsquo;s partnership with Facebook was a driver for the significant increase in video views, with a total of 4.3 billion views across all channels for the tournament, compared to 3.6 billion views which were garnered for the 2019 edition of the ICC Men&rsquo;s Cricket World Cup.</p>
			<p>The consumption across ICC&rsquo;s digital assets also grew, recording a total of 2.55 billion minutes. ICC&rsquo;s social media channels also saw a significant growth in engagement at 618 million across those platforms, which is a 28 per cent jump since the 2019 edition of the ICC Men&rsquo;s Cricket World Cup.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are pleased with these outstanding global viewership numbers, that demonstrate the power of T20I cricket to attract a huge audience across the globe on linear and digital platforms,&rdquo; commented ICC CEO Geoff Allardice. &ldquo;It reinforces our belief that there is a significant opportunity and appetite to grow the game in our strategic growth markets including the USA, so more fans can enjoy it, more kids are inspired by it and sponsors and broadcasters want to be a part of it.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacenews.com/kuaizhou-1a-rocket-launches-classified-shiyan-11-satellite/<br>
			</p>
			<p>HELSINKI &#151; A Chinese Kuaizhou-1A rocket launched the experimental Shiyan-11 satellite for China&rsquo;s main space contractor from northwest China late Nov. 24.</p>
			<p>The 19.4-meter-long Kuaizhou-1A lifted off from a transporter erector launcher at 6:41 p.m. Eastern Wednesday, rising into pre-dawn skies over the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert.</p>
			<p>Aboard was the classified Shiyan-11 satellite, belonging to a series of nominally experimental satellites. It was later tracked in a 489 by 502-kilometer altitude Sun-synchronous orbit by the U.S. 18th Space Control Squadron.</p>
			<p>Shiyan-11 was developed by the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST), the country&rsquo;s main state-owned spacecraft maker, according to a social media post from CAST&rsquo;s parent company, the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp., (CASC). No further detail</p>
			<p>The Kuaizhou-1A is operated by Expace, a launch service provider spinoff from the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp., (CASIC), another giant state-owned defense contractor with some level of involvement in state space activities and its own broad commercial plans including the Tengyun spaceplane.</p>
			<p>Kuaizhou rockets typically launch commercial payloads, such as Jilin-1 satellites for commercial remote sensing firm Changguang Satellite Technology, itself spun off from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. </p>
			<p>However Wednesday&rsquo;s launch was a rare example of the KZ-1A launching a government payload.</p>
			<p>The Kuaizhou-1A consists of three solid stages and a liquid propellant upper stage. Iti is capable of carrying 200 kilograms of payload into a 700-kilometer sun-synchronous orbit (SSO).</p>
			<p>CASC and its subordinates also have light-lift solid rockets, including Smart Dragon-1, capable of sending 150 kilograms to 700-km SSO, and the Long March 11 (350 kilograms to 700-km SSO).</p>
			<p>The former has not flown since its successful debut flight in August 2019, while the Long March 11 had its last outing in December 2020, launching the Gravitational Wave High-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) pair of satellites.</p>
			<p>The China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT) had stated plans to conduct two or three sea launches of the Long March 11 during 2021 yet none have taken place. Plans for a new, dedicated launch vessel have however been announced. </p>
			<p>The launch was the 13th of the Kuaizhou-1A rocket with the first taking place in January 2017. It is the third since September and follows a one-year period of being grounded after a September 2020 failure.</p>
			<p>The larger Kuaizhou-11 had a first flight in July 2020 which ended in failure. A return-to-flight has yet to take place but is expected in the near future.</p>
			<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s launch was China&rsquo;s 46th orbital launch of 2021, extending a new national record for launches in a calendar year. </p>
			<p>Galactic Energy, a private launch firm, is gearing up for a second launch of an improved Ceres-1 solid rocket from Jiuquan, a year after its successful debut mission.<br>

			<p><b><i>DVB releases 8K delivery specs <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/11/25/dvb-releases-1st-8k-delivery-specs/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The DVB Steering Board has approved specification updates that introduce capabilities to deliver 8K UHD video services for the first time. These updates, extending existing support for the HEVC codec, are the first step in a series of key additions planned for the DVB video coding specifications. These will ensure that DVB continues to provide the most comprehensive and flexible toolbox for the delivery of next generation television services via broadcast and broadband.</p>
			<p>HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding), also known as H.265, is a standard that offers from 25 per cent to 50 per cent better data compression at the same level of video quality compared to its predecessor MPEG-4/AVC. It is already used in several markets around the world. Until now, DVB specifications included HEVC conformance points only for up to 4K resolution.</p>
			<p>The recent DVB specification updates encompass delivery of 8K UHD via both broadcast (transport stream) and broadband (DVB-DASH). Approved for publication as DVB BlueBooks, the updated documents are DVB&rsquo;s specification for video and audio coding, the DVB-DASH profile for video streaming, and the DVB-SI specification for delivery of service information. All three updates also include some bug fixes.</p>
			<p>In the longer term, scaling 8K video delivery to end users will benefit from even more efficient video codecs. This is a goal of current DVB work on Next Generation Video Coding, which is expected to lead to further additions to the DVB specifications in 2022. The early availability of a HEVC conformance point supporting 8K video now will enable flexibility for deployments and maximize service interoperability across device ecosystems.<br>

			<p><b><i>AVIA: Satellite remains vital for video distribution <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/11/25/avia-satellite-remains-essential-element-for-video-distribution/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Asia Video Industry Association (AVIA) hosted its annual Satellite Industry Forum recently as a virtual conference, to end off the Asia Video Summit umbrella of events this year.</p>
			<p>The Forum opened with a look at Satellite Trends and Forecasts Post-Covid with Caleb Henry, Senior Analyst, Quilty Analytics. The traditional satcom industry continues to be in a state of rapid change, and still in a state of turmoil. While the industry is currently dominated by a handful of major players, this could also change dramatically over the next five years as new technologies and standards reset the competitive landscape. And despite the impact of Covid, there has been no let-up of interest in investment into the space industry with $5.5 billion (&euro;4.9bn) in collective proceeds from all 13 space SPACs. </p>
			<p>AVIA also hosted Stephen Spengler for his final keynote before he steps down as CEO of Intelsat. Spengler had spoken at the Satellite Industry Forum for his first keynote as CEO in 2015, hence it was fitting the Forum was his final address as well.</p>
			<p>While the industry continues to innovate and push the boundaries of what is possible, it has yet to reach its full potential in fulfilling its essential role in the global telecommunications landscape. With digital video making up 70 per cent of internet traffic, satellite remains the essential and enabling technology, with the ubiquity, reach and economics to serve the networks. </p>
			<p>Spengler&rsquo;s outlook on industry trends for Asia remains positive, with linear and pay TV distribution still a driving application for the Asia Pacific region, with a growth rate of 2.5 per cent per year. Spengler was also excited about 5G being a huge enabler and game changer. With satellite fully integrated into the 5G world, it will make solutions and services more seamless, interconnected, and economical. </p>
			<p>Wrapping up his keynote address, Spengler shared Intelsat&rsquo;s mission to unify the global telecoms ecosystem of the future. The vision requires all satellite and terrestrial technologies, networks and providers, and solutions and services to be unified as one global ecosystem. &ldquo;If we focus on our customers, the people who benefit from a more connected world, that is success for the next year and beyond,&rdquo; said Spengler. </p>
			<p>Asia Pacific&rsquo;s leading satellite operators also shared similar positive sentiments despite the move from broadcast to streaming. Yau Chyong Lim, COO, Measat, believes that satellite will still be the main platform to deliver video services nationwide in Malaysia, and it is the platforms themselves who are transforming their services to include streaming. Hence broadcast and streaming will complement each other, with linear still having a role to play, and streaming alongside it. Similar in Australia, despite a plethora of streaming services available, Nick Leake, Head of Satellite and Space Systems, Optus, still sees the same requirements for satellite to go out for at least another 10 years. The greatest issue for Asia Pacific remains one of scale, in order to provide reliable networks to serve the customers, added Roger Tong, CEO, AsiaSat. Tong believes that moving forward, creating more partnerships between competing satellite operators is important, especially when regulatory restrictions on consolidation remains a key challenge in the region.</p>
			<p>Sunil Bharti Mittal, Founder and Chairman, Bharti Enterprises and Executive Chairman, OneWeb, also joined the Forum this year for a keynote conversation on the space business in India. With the holy grail of low latency, high speed and sufficient capacity resolved by NGSOs, it has become a solution that works for the new world and into the future. 5G too is seen as a game changing technology for Mittal, with its extremely low latency a boom for industry applications. However, Mittal also noted that while NGSOs will have an important role to play in the 5G ecosystem, it will only be at the periphery of supporting 5G ambitions. Mittal also shared OneWeb&rsquo;s vision to connect all areas of the world, from oceans to aviation. &ldquo;In 5 years&rsquo; time. . . there should not be anybody in the world that is not connected,&rdquo; said Mittal. <br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/FCC_Validates_SES_Phase_I_Accelerated_C_band_Clearing_and_Relocation_Certification_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>SES, the leader in global content connectivity solutions, announces the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has validated the certification of SES's Phase I accelerated C-band clearing and relocation activities, a critical step to help meet the Commission's objectives to quickly roll out 5G services across the United States.</p>
			<p>With the help of trusted partners across the U.S., SES has completed all necessary Phase I clearing and relocation activities. These activities included relocating all of its existing services that are received by Incumbent Earth Stations out of the 3700-3820 MHz band exclusively in the contiguous United States and making necessary equipment changes on all associated Incumbent Earth Stations.</p>
			<p>SES also modified its telemetry, tracking and control (TT&amp;C) operations to operate above 4000 MHz and consolidated gateway services below 3820 MHz to two earth stations located in Hawley, PA and Brewster, WA.</p>
			<p>In accordance with the FCC Report and Order published in the Federal Register on 23 April 2020, SES has satisfied the Phase I relocation requirements in advance of the first accelerated relocation deadline on 5 December 2021, making it eligible for the first accelerated relocation payment valued at close to $1 billion. SES expects this payment to be made in Q1 2022.</p>

			<p><b><i>China boosts Earth-observation abilities with 2 Gaofen satellite launches<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.space.com/china-launches-earth-observation-gaofen-satellites<br>
			</p>
			<p>Very little is known about the powerful Gaofen 11 satellite.</p>
			<p>China continued its record-breaking year of launches by sending two satellites into orbit in recent days. </p>
			<p>The two new satellites launched on separate rockets and from different space centers, but they share a name, Gaofen (&quot;high resolution&quot;). While both will observe the Earth, each will have different roles and users.</p>
			<p>Most recently, orange flames lit up the pre-dawn sky over Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert on Monday (Nov. 22) at 5:45 p.m. EST (2245 GMT, 7:45 a.m. local time Nov. 23) as the engines of a Long March 4C rocket ignited.</p>
			<p>Aboard was the Gaofen 3 (02) radar Earth observation satellite, which rose to roughly 469 miles (755 kilometers) above Earth in a sun synchronous orbit. This special type of orbit, which nearly passes over the planet's poles, means that each time the satellite passes over any location on Earth, it is always the same local solar time. </p>
			<p>Gaofen 3 (02) joins the first Gaofen 3 satellite, which China launched into a similar orbit in August 2016, to form a constellation that uses radar to study both the land and the sea. The pair will be used for marine disaster prevention and mitigation, dynamic marine environment monitoring, environmental protection, water conservancy, agriculture and meteorology.</p>
			<p>China's National Satellite Ocean Application Center of the Ministry of Natural Resources, together with related departments, will take responsibility for on-orbit testing. The satellite was developed by the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) and features upgrades over the first Gaofen 3, including optimized imaging, improved ship-positioning technology and real-time onboard processing that makes imagery available much faster than transmitting raw data does.</p>
			<p>Gaofen satellites are optical and radar remote sensing satellites that form the China High-resolution Earth Observation System (CHEOS). The program was approved in 2010 and the first satellite, Gaofen 1, launched in 2013. </p>
			<p>Information has been published about many of the Gaofen satellites and their civilian purposes. However details about higher-number Gaofen satellites are classified.</p>
			<p>And days before Gaofen 3 (02), China launched just such a payload. The mystery Gaofen 11 (03) satellite lifted off on Friday (Nov. 19) at 8:51 p.m. EST (Nov. 20 at 0151 GMT or 9:51 a.m. local time). Insulation tiles fell away from the Long March 4B as the rocket rose from its pad at the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in northern China and into cloudy skies. </p>
			<p>No details were published about the satellite's capabilities. State media reported that the satellite will be &quot;mainly used for land surveys, city planning, land rights confirmation, road network design, crop yield estimation and disaster prevention and mitigation.&quot;</p>
			<p>Gaofen 11 satellites could have resolution capabilities as sharp as 4 inches (10 centimeters), according to reporting by SpaceNews. That level of detail would make these satellites comparable to the assumed optical capabilities of the United States' Keyhole-class classified spy satellites. President Donald Trump tweeted an image of a satellite photo apparently taken by one such U.S. satellite back in August 2019, providing an indication of the capabilities of this type of satellite. </p>
			<p>China now has three Gaofen 11 satellites, with the new satellite joining predecessors launched in 2018 and 2020, with a rocket stage from the latter landing near a school. The U.S. National Reconnaissance Office oversees a constellation of classified spy satellites in orbit. </p>
			<p>The launches were China's 44th and 45th of 2021, extending a national record for orbital launches in a calendar year. In comparison, the U.S. has launched 44 times, including five launches of Rocket Lab's Electron from New Zealand.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://tass.com/science/1365439<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Ekspress-AMU3 and Ekspress-AMU7 telecoms satellites were earlier expected to be launched in 2020</p>
			<p>MOSCOW, November 24. /TASS/. The launch of a Proton-M carrier rocket with Ekspress telecoms satellites is scheduled for 15:09 Moscow time on December 12, the federal space agency Roscosmos announced on Wednesday.</p>
			<p>&quot;A paired launch of Ekspress-AMU7 and Ekspress-AMU3 satellites with the help of the Proton-M carrier rocket and the Briz-M booster is scheduled for 15:09 Moscow time on December 12, 2021,&quot; Roscosmos said in a statement.</p>
			<p>Roscosmos Chief Dmitry Rogozin earlier told TASS that the launch of the Ekspress-AMU3 and Ekspress-AMU7 telecoms satellites atop the Proton-M carrier rocket had been rescheduled from December 6 for December 12 over the need to carry out some work on the Briz-M upper stage. Roscosmos later specified that specialists of the Khrunichev Space Center had eliminated a fault found earlier on the Briz-M booster.</p>
			<p>The Ekspress-AMU3 and Ekspress-AMU7 telecoms satellites were earlier expected to be launched in 2020. CEO of the Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems Company Nikolai Testoyedov told TASS in September last year that the production of the satellites was being delayed over the late delivery of payloads for these space vehicles from Italy due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
			<p>Roscosmos Chief Rogozin announced in December last year that the launch of these satellites had been rescheduled for the end of 2021. Roscosmos announced its plans in mid-November to launch the satellites on December 6.<br>

			</p>
			<p>OneWeb's satellites are built in Florida under a joint venture with Airbus, called OneWeb Satellites. Credit: OneWeb</p>
			<p>TAMPA, Fla. &#151; OneWeb is considering options to remove one of its broadband satellites from low Earth orbit after it failed following a software issue last year.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are looking at all potential suppliers to address de-orbit as and when the tech is safe,&rdquo; said Chris Mclaughlin, OneWeb&rsquo;s chief of government, regulation and engagement.</p>
			<p>The failure was disclosed in a OneWeb financial report filed Nov. 17. That report noted OneWeb has deployed 358 satellites at 1,200 kilometers through 11 launches, &ldquo;with loss of only one satellite to date.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Mclaughlin said the failure of OneWeb&rsquo;s SL41 satellite resulted from &ldquo;a software issue right at the end of the Orbit raise.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>That software issue has since been fixed from the ground for the other satellites in the operator&rsquo;s growing network, a OneWeb official added.</p>
			<p>The failed satellite, according to an industry source, was one of 34 launched Feb. 6, 2020, from Kazakhstan aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket. OneWeb&rsquo;s satellites are being built in Florida by OneWeb Satellites, a joint venture with Airbus Defence and Space.</p>
			<p>OneWeb has a partnership formed earlier this year with debris-removal startup Astroscale under ESA&rsquo;s Sunrise program, which awarded OneWeb and Astroscale funding in May for a satellite to demonstrate technologies including space junk removal.</p>
			<p>The OneWeb official added: &ldquo;We are working with ESA Sunrise and, by extension, Astroscale and others to determine how best to remove a failed satellite when technology permits. It&rsquo;s very early days.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The loss of a single satellite is not critical in a megaconstellation like OneWeb&rsquo;s with built-in redundancy. OneWeb plans to deploy nearly 650 satellites by the time it rolls out global broadband services next year.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;OneWeb&rsquo;s network is designed for global coverage with redundancy planned for and built into the network,&rdquo; the OneWeb official said via email.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;OneWeb can offer global coverage with 588 satellites however plans for redundancy with 50+ spares.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The U.K.-headquartered startup has an insurance policy worth more than $1 billion that covers its satellite launches, which typically deploy 36 satellites at a time. However, the policy only spans the launch phase of the constellation&rsquo;s deployment, and does not cover in-orbit failures.</p>
			<p>SpaceX, which has claimed to have an in-orbit failure rate of less than 1% (although competitor Viasat disputes that), has also decided it has enough redundancy in its Starlink broadband megaconstellation that it does not need to insure in-orbit operations against satellite failures.</p>
			<p>Potential mission</p>
			<p>In October, the UK Space Agency awarded Astroscale and Swiss startup ClearSpace contracts totaling $1 million to study a mission to remove two spacecraft from LEO by 2025.</p>
			<p>Astroscale and ClearSpace are allowed to pick which two spacecraft to remove, as long as they were sent to orbit under a U.K. license.</p>
			<p>It is too early to say whether the failed OneWeb satellite will be a part of a mission that could follow these study contracts, an Astroscale official said.</p>
			<p>Following the Phase 0 and A study phases there will most likely be two further phases to refine the mission design with parallel phase B contracts with a detailed concept of operations, costings, manufacturing proposals, and timelines, according to John Auburn, managing director of Astroscale&rsquo;s U.K. subsidiary.</p>
			<p>A final selection will identify the lead industry prime and partners that will develop the mission planned for a 2025 launch. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;We very much hope the UK government will be able to provide a substantial proportion of the mission funds, secured during the ongoing government comprehensive spending review (CSR),&rdquo; Auburn said in an email.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This mission is a fantastic opportunity for the UK government to demonstrate leadership in space sustainability and provide vital funding and licencing support for this innovative debris removal mission.&rdquo;<br>

			<p>TAMPA, Fla. &#151; Intelsat and SES have beaten a key regulatory deadline for clearing C-band spectrum across the United States, unlocking more than $2 billion in combined proceeds from the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
			<p>The satellite operators, which hold the largest share of the 500 MHz C-band in the U.S., said the FCC has validated the completion of activities necessary for vacating a 120 MHz swath of the spectrum by Dec. 5, under Phase I of the regulator&rsquo;s accelerated schedule.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Over the past two years we have worked tirelessly to quickly clear spectrum while also carefully transitioning our customers&rsquo; services, and we are incredibly proud of what we have accomplished,&rdquo; SES CEO Steve Collar said in a statement.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This was a tremendous undertaking, and our success reinforces our confidence in our ability to meet the FCC&rsquo;s Phase II deadline in 2023.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>C-band holders in the U.S. are in line to receive $9.7 billion in total for clearing 300 MHz of the band for terrestrial 5G wireless operators by Dec. 5, 2023, by moving customers to the upper 200 MHz of the band.</p>
			<p>Intelsat and SES are set to get $4.9 billion and $3.97 billion, respectively, under the FCC&rsquo;s plan.</p>
			<p>However, SES is disputing Intelsat&rsquo;s share of the proceeds in legal action taking place at Intelsat&rsquo;s bankruptcy court.</p>
			<p>SES is one of Intelsat&rsquo;s largest creditors in its Chapter 11 process, complicating the operator&rsquo;s restructuring plans.</p>
			<p>Intelsat said Aug. 25 that it had widespread support for a plan of reorganization that would cut the company&rsquo;s debt by more than half to $7 billion.</p>
			<p>The operator is seeking approval from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia for this plan, with a hearing set to begin Dec. 2.</p>
			<p>If approved, Intelsat would emerge from bankruptcy as a private company, although an Intelsat official said it plans to become &ldquo;publicly traded again at some point in the next five years.&rdquo;<br>

			</p>
			<p>Punit Goenka, MD of Zee Entertainment, giving a keynote speech at Media Partners Asia&rsquo;s APOS India event, told delegates that the merger with Sony Pictures Networks India was in its final stages of agreement.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I certainly believe that consolidation is going to benefit the industry overall. Zee and Sony will form the largest media entertainment player in the country. Our revenues on a standalone basis combined will be close to $2 billion, and the capital growth that Sony is going to infuse in the merged entity will really give us the opportunity to invest in premium content and include sports,&rdquo; stated Goenka.</p>
			<p>He added that the combined business would be in a position to create major entertainment properties and to acquire IP across all genres of the business.</p>
			<p>That growth could also include Sport. Zee sold off its then Ten Sport division to Sony back in 2017. Bringing Ten Sport back into a merged business could mean more cash on the table to build for key sporting events, not least cricket.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;And the sector itself will see a lot more happening going forward. So certainly sports will become an area of focus for the merged entity,&rdquo; Goenka told delegates.</p>
			<p>He also touched on the progress for ZEE5, its international OTT service, saying that it was enjoying growth quarter on quarter.<br>

			<p>Inmarsat-6, built by Airbus (and the first Inmarsat to be built by Airbus) has been shipped from the Airbus facility in Toulouse to Tanegashima in Japan ready for launch.</p>
			<p>The satellite will operate in both multibeam Ka-band and L-band and will use a huge 9 metre antenna for its L-band services. It also houses an exceptionally large &lsquo;next generation&rsquo; digitally processed payload giving greater flexibility to Inmarsat.</p>
			<p>This first satellite of the Inmarsat-6 series is due to be launched on an H-IIA launch rocket built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) next month. Inmarsat-6 F1 is based on Airbus&rsquo; Eurostar E3000 spacecraft and will be the 54th Eurostar E3000 launched. It will be the fifth Eurostar in orbit that is equipped with electric propulsion for orbit raising reinforcing Airbus&rsquo; position as a major leader in electric propulsion.</p>
			<p>The new generation modular digital processor on the satellite provides full routing flexibility over up to 8000 channels and dynamic power allocation to more than 200 spot beams in L-band. Ka-band spot beams will be steerable over the full Earth disk, with flexible channel to beam allocation.</p>
			<p>Inmarsat is in the process of being acquired by Viasat of California.</p>
			<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Gaullier, Head of Telecom Systems at Airbus, said: &ldquo;Inmarsat-6 F1 features one of the most sophisticated digitally processed payloads we have ever built and delivers remarkable flexibility, capability and capacity. As a long serving supplier to Inmarsat, having built the Inmarsat-4 and Alphasat satellites, Airbus is proud to continue helping keep Inmarsat at the top of its game with this step change in capability brought by Inmarsat-6.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>OneWeb loses a satellite<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacewatch.global/2021/11/oneweb-loses-a-satellite/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Edinburgh, 23 November 2021. &#150; OneWeb reported that one of their broadband satellites launched early last year suffered a software failure. The failed spacecraft, orbiting at 1200 km, will be de-orbited. Other satellites in the fleet were successfully updated from the ground.</p>
			<p>OneWeb carried out 11 launches over the past year and currently has market access rights in 38 countries. The company has 358 satellites in orbit at the moment and this number is to grow to 650 by late 2022.</p>
			<p>OneWeb recently paid paid US $49.3M in assorted fees to bankers and lawyers who gave the company financial advice. The advice was regarding cash investment from the UK government and India&rsquo;s Bharti Global which rescued them from bankruptcy.</p>
			<p>OneWeb is now in the development and launch so it is not recovering cash from user access. The business closed last year with a loss of US $58.3M.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/11/22/venezuela-offers-free-dth/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Venezuela&rsquo;s government is broadcasting 27 national and international TV channels (and 10 radio services) on a free-to-view DTH service.</p>
			<p>Conatel, the nation&rsquo;s National telecommunications Commission, announced the project and described it as &ldquo;the new way of watching television&rdquo;. However, although content viewing will be completely free, users must buy a Set Top Box converter ($29) and a satellite antenna ($22).</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It is a solution from Conatel to promote free satellite television, allowing Venezuelans to access it without subscription or cost,&rdquo; notes the website.</p>
			<p>The move comes about as a government-inspired solution to replacing the signals from DirecTV when the US broadcaster removed its channels.</p>
			<p>In addition to Venezuelan channels, the portfolio will have the following channels from other countries:</p>
			<p>&middot; TV P&uacute;blica (Argentina)<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/11/23/ibc-2021-cancelled/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The organisers of the IBC show have confirmed that the 2021 in-person event will not go ahead. </p>
			<p>The Amsterdam show was scheduled to take place between December 3-6, but questions started to be raised when the Dutch government launched a series of lockdown measures in response to mounting Covid-19 cases in the country. </p>
			<p>These lockdown measures, which are scheduled to run until at least December 3, place strict curfews on retail, dining and events. </p>
			<p>In light of the restrictions and increased Covid risk, a number of major exhibitors including Canon and Synamedia withdrew from the show. </p>
			<p>With mounting pressure from exhibitors and attendees, IBC has officially cancelled the event a little more than a week and a half before it&rsquo;s scheduled staging. </p>
			<p>In a statement, the event organiser said: &ldquo;IBC announces that the in-person IBC2021 event has been cancelled. </p>
			<p>The move follows growing concerns about the Covid-19 situation in The Netherlands, which has deteriorated over the past week, and feedback from the IBC exhibitor and visitor community.</p>
			<p>The IBC Partnership Board made the decision today in order to prevent exhibitors and visitors from travelling to The Netherlands.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/11/19/sky-new-zealand-partners-with-irdeto/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Sky New Zealand has selected Iredto as the security partner for its Sky Box STB.</p>
			<p>The operator will deploy Irdeto&rsquo;s Cloaked CA to protect content on the Android TV-based set-top box. The solution is a cardless conditional access system for broadcast and IPTV operators, which Irdeto says is the most advanced and widely deployed across the world. Cloaked CA is complemented by Irdeto&rsquo;s forensic watermarking solution TraceMark, which is pre-integrated into the solution.</p>
			<p>Sky New Zealand has also contracted Irdeto to operate a fully scalable CA cloud-based solution, and is implementing Irdeto App Watch for Android TV. The latter promises to ensure the integrity of the apps running on Sky&rsquo;s Android TV STBs. </p>
			<p>Sky Chief Executive Sophie Moloney says: &ldquo;We are excited to be evolving our Sky Box to give customers an even better viewing experience and using innovative technology to meet their future needs as well as attracting new customers. Feedback from our customers has been at the heart of the Sky Box development program from day one, and this new partnership with Irdeto will allow us to deliver on what matters most to customers for the new box.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Doug Lowther, Chief Executive Officer of Irdeto, said: &ldquo;Premium content services are in high demand in New Zealand, and in an increasingly competitive worldwide market, operators must not only meet premium content security criteria but also seek for smarter methods to run their businesses and deliver on what matters most to customers. Sky New Zealand&rsquo;s decision to partner with us demonstrates that the company is proactive in responding to market changes, and as a trusted security partner, we look forward to collaborating on many future deployments.&rdquo;<br>

			</p>
			<p>Australian multiplay telco Optus Sport will continue streaming its exclusive coverage of the world&rsquo;s best football to its one million plus active subscribers.</p>
			<p>The renewals lock in Optus Sport&rsquo;s Premier League rights for six years until 2028, and FA Women&rsquo;s Super League until after the FIFA Women&rsquo;s World Cup into 2024.</p>
			<p>The announcement means Optus remains the Premier League&rsquo;s exclusive Australian partner to almost the end of the decade and sees the service extend its coverage of the WSL to 2024, well beyond the FIFA Women&rsquo;s World Cup 2023 hosted in Australia.</p>
			<p>Acording to Optus Sport, the deal is a win for fans of the game, with the renewal meaning every Premier League match will be available to watch live and exclusive, on demand replay, and via the Mini Match edits through Optus Sport.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are thrilled to be able to significantly extend our exclusive partnership with Premier League and the FA Women&rsquo;s Super League and continue to bring the best football coverage to more than a million of our passionate and loyal Optus Sport customers,&rdquo; declared Optus CEO, Kelly Bayer Rosmarin.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is another proof point that we are continuing to deliver unique customer experiences and exceptional value for our Mobile and Home customers, in addition to our industry-leading Living Network, Australia&rsquo;s fastest 5G, and our newly launched SubHub, a revolutionary subscription aggregation platform,&rdquo; she added.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In the six years since securing the exclusive Premier League rights, Optus Sport has become the undisputed home of premium European football and has introduced new Australian audiences to the game whilst setting the benchmark on live sports streaming,&rdquo; remarked Optus&rsquo;s VP of TV, Content and Product Development, Clive Dickens.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Optus Sport has more than doubled its subscribers since 2018, engagement is up over 49 per cent year-on-year and we&rsquo;ve seen nine of our top 10 most watched matches occurring during 2021. This includes the historic EURO 2020 England vs Italy Final, which broke the Australian record for a live sports streaming event, with almost one million households watching the match live, no single streamed Tokyo Olympic event reached this many households,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The Premier League is delighted to extend our partnership with Optus for a further six seasons up to 2027/28,&rdquo; commented Paul Molnar, Chief Media Officer at the Premier League. &ldquo;Optus has proven to be an outstanding home for the Premier League in Australia and has helped to grow the fan base of the Premier League and its clubs through market-leading content and impressive innovation.

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/127024355/rocket-lab-successfully-deploys-satellites-after-getting-back-into-space<br>
			</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab has successfully completed its first mission in almost four months, with a launch on Thursday afternoon from the M&#x0101;hai Peninsular near Gisborne going smoothly.</p>
			<p>The company last week delayed the launch &#150; which was first since it listed on the United States&rsquo; Nasdaq stock market in August &#150; because of a suspect sensor reading.</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab confirmed shortly after 5pm that the two observation satellites owned by regular commercial customer BlackSky that were on broad its Electron rocket had been successfully deployed.</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab used helicopter to shadow the first-stage rocket body of the Electron as it parachuted down into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
			<p>That is in preparation for future attempts to snag rocket bodies by helicopter before they hit the sea, making it more likely more parts will be able to be reused in future launches.</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab founder Peter Beck said the company was excited about being able to move on to that next stage next year.</p>
			<p>Thousands of investors now have skin in the game as shareholders in the Kiwi-founded launch company, which is now structured as a US firm.</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab is continuing to prepare for the day when it tries to catch a first-stage rocket before it falls back into the sea.</p>
			<p>Covid restrictions forced Rocket Lab to delay launches planned for September and October.</p>
			<p>However, the company has been active on the corporate front, continuing to secure launch contracts and research funds, and last week agreed to buy satellite hardware company Planetary Systems Corporation for up to US$81.4 million (NZ$116m) in cash and shares.</p>
			<p>In October, it bought Colorado-based space navigation company Advanced Solutions for US$40m.<br>

			<p><b><i>OneWeb loses a satellite at 1200km <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/11/17/oneweb-loses-a-satellite-at-1200km/<br>
			</p>
			<p>OneWeb says it has suffered a failure of one of its broadband satellites. The craft, which orbits at 1200km, was said by OneWeb to be one of a batch launched early last year and the failure is blamed on a software problem.</p>
			<p>Other satellites in the fleet were updated from the ground and the malfunction cured. The failed satellite will be de-orbited.</p>
			<p>The news emerged within OneWeb&rsquo;s Financial Statement which highlighted its 11 launches over the past year. It says it now has market access rights in 38 countries.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;At October 2021, OneWeb has signed distribution agreements with a number of key partners in Alaska and Canada, and is in conversation with a number of further potential global partners, ahead of commercial service launch by end of calendar year 2021,&rdquo; stated the financial report.</p>
			<p>OneWeb says that it will have launched all into initial fleet of 650 satellites by late 2022 (it has 358 satellites in orbit at the moment).</p>
			<p>OneWeb also revealed that it had paid $49.3 million in assorted fees to the bankers and lawyers who advised it on its input of investment cash from the UK government and India&rsquo;s Bharti Global which kick-started the rescue of the company from bankruptcy.</p>
			<p>The sale/purchase agreement &ldquo;required the Company to fund the selling costs of the former shareholders of OneWeb Communications&rdquo;, said OneWeb.</p>
			<p>At the moment OneWeb is in the development and launch phase and is not recovering cash from subscriptions/user access. This means that the business made a loss last year of $58.3 million in its 12-months of trading to March 31st.<br>

			<p><b><i>India wants new satellite gateways <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/11/17/india-wants-new-satellite-gateways/<br>
			</p>
			<p>India&rsquo;s telecom regulator TRAI is inviting comments and ideas as to how the nation can set up new satellite gateways and Earth stations which are needed to cope with rising demand for satellite-based connectivity.</p>
			<p>TRAI, working to a brief from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) earlier in September, is to supply recommendations covering the licencing framework for satellite Earth station gateway operations and to include aspects such as licencing fees, potential entry fees, network operation and control centres.</p>
			<p>India has already allowed one Earth station in order to connect to Inmarsat&rsquo;s satellite constellation.</p>
			<p>But now the likes of Bharti-backed OneWeb, Elon Musk&rsquo;s Starlink and other would-be satellite-based suppliers, are looking to access to the giant Indian market.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The current licensing framework mandates a licensee to establish its own gateway for rendering any kind of satellite-based communication services. As per the licence conditions [&#x2026;] the service provider licensee is required to establish gateway itself for rendering satellite based communication services. There are no provisions in the existing licenses of VSAT [or other] gateways by service providers established by a satellite constellation operator,&rdquo; TRAI said in its consultation paper.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Given the circumstances, it may be desirable to explore the possibility of a licensing framework for establishing gateway as an independent facility, set up either by a satellite constellation operator or any other entity,&rdquo; said TRAI. &ldquo;Under the new framework, the licensee who establishes gateway should be able to deliver its services to other licensees, which in turn would render services to the end users.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>TRAI has sought comments on the consultation paper by December 13th and counter comments by December 27th.<br>

			<p><b><i>Optus Selects Launch Partner for Next Gen Satellite<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.optus.com.au/about/media-centre/media-releases/2021/11/optus-selects-launch-partner-for-next-gen-satellite?utm_source=miragenews&amp;utm_medium=miragenews&amp;utm_campaign=news<br>
			</p>
			<p>Optus, Australia&rsquo;s largest and most experienced satellite owner and operator, has selected Arianespace to provide launch services for Optus 11, the replacement for its D1 Satellite.</p>
			<p>The replacement of D1 is planned for 2023 and will see Optus&rsquo; next generation satellite, Optus 11, launch into orbit. This next generation satellite, the Asia-Pacific region&rsquo;s first software-defined high throughput satellite (HTS), will be capable of delivering expanded coverage, enhanced performance and increased flexibility into the region&rsquo;s broadcast and broadband capability.</p>
			<p>Optus 11 will be launched at Arianespace&rsquo;s launch facilities in French Guiana, South America. Optus has a long-standing relationship with Arianespace, with the two organisations first working together more than 30 years ago on the launch of Optus A3, Optus&rsquo; third spacecraft. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;A vital element to the successful deployment of a new satellite are the partners that we work with. We are delighted to be partnering again with Arianespace, who&rsquo;s demonstrated over many years the ability to consistently deliver a precise deployment and speed to orbit&rdquo; said Ben White, Managing Director, Wholesale, Satellite and Strategy at Optus.</p>
			<p>While traditional satellites are limited by on-ground configurations which can&rsquo;t be altered after launch, Optus 11 will begin with next-gen technology that can be fully configurable in space, meaning its location, coverage, bandwidth and capacity can be changed in orbit as customer demands evolve.</p>
			<p>White said, &ldquo;A successful launch will position Optus to build on our delivery of unparalleled flexibility for our satellite broadcast and data customers across Australia and New Zealand and using satellite backhaul to provide critical support for our mobile network&rsquo;s contributions to the Government&rsquo;s Mobile Black Spot Program (MBSP).&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are delighted and honoured by this renewed mark of confidence from the operator Optus,&rdquo; said St&eacute;phane Isra&euml;l, Chief Executive Officer of Arianespace.  &ldquo;Over the last 21 years, we have carried out all launches for Optus, and Ariane 6 will now continue this long and successful track record.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Optus provides satellite services to Australia and NZ Government departments, companies and broadcasters including Foxtel, ABC, SBS, Seven Network, regional broadcasters such as Imparja Television, Sky New Zealand and Kordia, in addition to services in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica.</p>

			<p><b><i>Russia Confirms ASAT Test, Space Industry Condemns &lsquo;Deliberate Action&rsquo;<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.satellitetoday.com/government-military/2021/11/16/russia-confirms-asat-test-space-industry-condemns-deliberate-action/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Russian officials on Tuesday confirmed that the Russian Defense Ministry destroyed a defunct satellite with a weapons system, but rejected the U.S. government&rsquo;s assertion that debris from the test poses a risk. </p>
			<p>According to Russian state news service TASS, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has said that Russia successfully tested a &ldquo;cutting-edge system of the future,&rdquo; that &ldquo;hit an old satellite with precision worthy of a goldsmith.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>Shoigu said the debris poses &ldquo;no threat&rdquo; to space activity, which goes against the assessment from U.S. government and military officials. </p>
			<p>U.S. Space Command said Monday that Russia&rsquo;s test of a Direct-Ascent Anti-Satellite (DA-ASAT) missile created 1,500 pieces of trackable debris, and will likely create hundreds of thousands of pieces of smaller orbital debris that will remain in orbit for years, posing a &ldquo;significant risk&rdquo; to the crew on the International Space Station (ISS) and multiple countries&rsquo; satellites. </p>
			<p>The Russian defense agency pointed out that the United States, China, and India have all conducted such tests, and the U.S. stated space strategy to develop &ldquo;comprehensive military advantage&rdquo; in space. According to TASS, the Defense Ministry said that it was &ldquo;conducting routine activity to strengthen the nation&rsquo;s defenses.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The U.S. tested an ASAT weapon in 2008, and the national Defense Space Strategy released in 2020 identifies a &ldquo;comprehensive military advantage&rdquo; in space as a prioritized line of effort. </p>
			<p>After U.S. officials condemned the test as reckless, dangerous, and irresponsible on Monday, space companies and organizations followed suit. </p>
			<p>The Secure World Foundation called upon the United States, Russia, China, and India to declare unilateral moratoriums on ASAT weapon testing that could create additional orbital debris, and to work toward an international ban on ASAT testing.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The continued testing or demonstration of anti-satellite capabilities, including the targeting of one own&rsquo;s space objects, is an unsustainable, irresponsible, and destabilizing activity in space in which no responsible spacefaring state should engage,&rdquo; Secure World Foundation said n a Tuesday statement.</p>
			<p>Astroscale, which offers commercial solutions for space debris and satellite servicing called for the international community to work together for a &ldquo;safe and sustainable&rdquo; space environment. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;This ASAT test threatens the incredible progress we are making as a global community, endangering humans in orbit and the long-term stability of the space environment. Our orbital highways are already congested, and every further piece of debris created increases the risks and costs of operating in space,&rdquo; Astroscale said in a statement. </p>
			<p>The Space Data Association, which facilitates space data sharing and includes major satellite operators Eutelsat, Inmarsat, Intelsat, and SES, also condemned Russia&rsquo;s actions. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;It is the responsibility of all countries, institutions and companies active in space to ensure that they always act in a safe manner and avoid any actions that risk that sustainability,&rdquo; commented Chairman Pascal Wauthier. &ldquo;This test risks everything that responsible space actors are working tirelessly to protect and represents a deliberate action that undermines the safe and sustainable use of space for all of humankind.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/127010355/central-otago-space-radar-detects-debris-from-irresponsible-russian-antisatellite-missile-test<br>
			</p>
			<p>A Central Otago space radar has detected multiple pieces of debris created by a Russian missile test that has been condemned as &ldquo;dangerous and irresponsible&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>The Naseby radar, built in 2019 by space network LeoLabs, first detected the debris on Monday.</p>
			<p>The US State Department confirmed the debris was from an old Russian satellite that had been destroyed in &ldquo;a destructive satellite test of a direct-ascent anti-satellite missile against one of its own satellites&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It was dangerous. It was reckless. It was irresponsible,&rdquo; said state department spokesman Ned Price.</p>
			<p>The Naseby space radar was built on Jo and Phil Dowling&rsquo;s farm in the Maniototo area, with the purpose of detecting space debris smaller than a loaf of bread from 2500 kilometres.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;[A LeoLabs representative] just called in one day, and it was this section of land they were interested in as it had power, internet and was a suitable bit of land,&rdquo; said Jo Dowling.</p>
			<p>LeoLabs confirmed on Twitter on Tuesday that its Naseby radar had detected the debris. &ldquo;With new data from Kiwi Space Radar gathered at 1620 UTC, we confirm detection of multiple objects near expected location of [the defunct] Cosmos 1408 [satellite].&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The Naseby radar picked up the debris and near collision with the International Space Station in an orbit about 500 kilometres above the Earth&rsquo;s surface, and about 80 kilometres above the International Space Station&rsquo;s (ISS) orbit.</p>
			<p>By Wednesday morning, the Kiwi based radar had found 216 objects from the Cosmos1408 break-up.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This number will grow significantly as we gather more data and the objects begin to further separate from one another in their new orbits,&rdquo; LeoLabs tweeted.</p>
			<p>The Dowlings were ahead of the news on Tuesday, as they are notified when incidents take place at the space radar.</p>
			<p>Jo Dowling said they were kept informed of &ldquo;heaps of interesting stuff that happens&rdquo; and thought it was &ldquo;quite cool&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>The US State Department condemned Russia's anti-satellite weapon test, which caused the seven astronauts on the Cosmos International Space Station to take cover on several occasions.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the ISS were forced to take cover approximately every hour and a half as the station&rsquo;s orbit intersected with that of the debris.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Russia&rsquo;s dangerous and irresponsible behaviour jeopardises the long-term sustainability of outer space and clearly demonstrates that Russia&rsquo;s claims of opposing the weaponisation of space are disingenuous and hypocritical,&rdquo; said Price.</p>
			<p>New Zealand Minister of Disarmament and Arms Control</p>
			<p>New Zealand condemns Russia&rsquo;s destructive anti-satellite test overnight. Deliberate creation of debris causes unacceptable interference to sustainability, spaceflight and space infrastructure. It is irresponsible and undermines efforts to oppose the weaponisation of space.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;New Zealand condemns Russia&rsquo;s destructive anti-satellite test overnight,&rdquo; said Twyford in a tweet posted on Tuesday. &ldquo;Deliberate creation of debris causes unacceptable interference to sustainability, space flight and space infrastructure. It is irresponsible and undermines efforts to oppose the weaponisation of space.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>New Zealand Space Operations chief executive Robin McNeill said the international space community took a very dim view of anyone intentionally creating space debris.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I remember attending a space conference shortly after a defunct satellite had been shot down, creating a mess. Let&rsquo;s just say that the attendees took it all very, very personally and the attendees from the country that did it looked particularly glum the whole time,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;There is a huge effort going on in the space community to try and work out ways to clean up space and so deliberately creating a mess there is not welcomed by anyone. Avoiding space junk, as it is called, is not trivial.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The purpose of the Naseby radar, one of three owned by LeoLabs worldwide, is to minimise the number of satellite collisions by tracking hundreds of thousands of pieces of so-called &lsquo;&rsquo;space junk&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>
			<p>The radar station can keep tabs on pieces of debris that are as small as 2 centimetres in diameter.</p>
			<p>Space agency studies have shown that objects that small have enough energy that if they hit a satellite, they are likely to shatter it and createi a cloud of debris that spreads out around the globe.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.capacitymedia.com/articles/3830145/satadsl-partners-abs-in-southeast-asia<br>
			</p>

			</p>
			<p>The space corporation Roscosmos added that the satellites had been delivered to Baikonur on October 18</p>
			<p>MOSCOW, November 13. /TASS/. The Proton-M carrier rocket will launch the Ekspress-AMU3 and Ekspress-AMU7 telecoms satellites into the orbit from Baikonur Cosmodrome on December 6, Russia&rsquo;s space agency Roscosmos said in a statement on Saturday.</p>
			<p>The space corporation added that the satellites had been delivered to Baikonur on October 18.</p>
			<p>&quot;Now, preparation for their launch is underway. It [the launch] is scheduled for 15.20 Moscow time on December 6, 2021,&quot; Roscosmos said.</p>
			<p>The satellites were earlier expected to be launched in 2020. CEO of the Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems Company Nikolai Testoyedov told TASS in September last year that the production of the satellites was being delayed over the late delivery of payloads for these space vehicles from Italy due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
			<p>Roscosmos Chief Dmitry Rogozin announced in December last year that the launch of these satellites had been rescheduled for the end of 2021.<br>

			<p><b><i>Why Foxtel is worth upwards of $2 billion<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.afr.com/street-talk/why-foxtel-is-worth-upwards-of-2-billion-20211115-p598yd<br>
			</p>
			<p>If pay TV turned streaming company Foxtel proceeds, as anticipated, with a listing in 2022, it is likely to be between $2 billion and $2.9 billion.</p>
			<p>That&rsquo;s the view of Morgan Stanley equity analyst Andrew McLeod, who says a four to six times EBITDA multiple is appropriate for the business.</p>
			<p>Foxtel boss Patrick Delany. </p>
			<p>McLeod, who published a note on Monday outlining Foxtel&rsquo;s valuation and why it would be a good thing for News Corporation shareholders to &ldquo;crystallise&rdquo; the value of Foxtel. News Corp owns 65 per cent of Foxtel, while Telstra owns the rest.</p>
			<p>The note comes after months of chatter about Foxtel reprising its float plans, with Street Talk revealing in July that it was talking to bankers to gauge their views.</p>
			<p>At the time there were no concrete plans, but there is Foxtel strategic review underway and at the recent earnings call on November 5, News Corp CEO Robert Thomson referenced previous companies it had sold and said it was constantly reviewing its structure.</p>
			<p>Naturally, it&rsquo;s got shareholders thinking about a listing or a spin-off.</p>
			<p>Comparable multiples</p>
			<p>McLeod&rsquo;s valuation calculations assumed EBITDA of $US369 million for the 2022 financial year. Assessing a range of broadcast TV stocks, like The Australian Financial Review owner Nine, as well as cable/satellite TV companies in the US and pay TV comparable stocks in Australia and New Zealand, namely Sky TV NZ, EBITDA multiples ranged from two times to 10 times.</p>
			<p>US-based Charter Communications fetched the highest multiple at 10.1 times EBITDA, while Nine trades on a 6.5 times multiple and Sky TV NZ (SKT NZ) just 2.5 times.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In our view four to six times is an appropriate range. Firstly, importantly because Foxtel does not own its own fibre/network and thus does not have a wholly-owned broadband/data business, we believe it should be valued on lower multiples than the US peer group of Altice, Comcast, Charter, DISH and their range 7.8 to 10.1 times,&rdquo; McLeod said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Secondly, we think SKT NZ is actually the closest comparable, in terms of managing a legacy satellite payTV subscriber business, with no broadband assets. But to Foxtel&rsquo;s advantage it does have a more advanced streaming TV business versus SKT NZ, thus in our view Foxtel warrants a premium multiple to SKT NZ on 2.5 times enterprise value to EBITDA.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Compared to local stocks, McLeod did not believe Foxtel warranted a multiple as high as Nine&rsquo;s, thanks to the broadcaster having a superior group of digital assets, namely Domain, 9Now, Stan and the digital news sites.</p>
			<p>Instead, he thought Foxtel was most comparable with Seven West Media which trades on a 4.5 times EV to EBITDA multiple. McLeod positioned them both as turnaround/restructure stories that had debt challenges, but have now returned to positive earnings momentum following COVID-19.</p>
			<p>McLeod estimated that Foxtel&rsquo;s EBITDA peaked in the 2017 financial year at around $US699 million, declining since then thanks to the emergence of rivals like Netflix, Stan and Amazon Prime Video, plus the hyper-inflation of TV sports rights.</p>
			<p>But, in the last year, subscriptions to Foxtel&rsquo;s sports streaming platform Kayo and entertainment content platform Binge have exceeded analyst expectations. There&rsquo;s also been a slowdown in cord-cutting of legacy Foxtel services and Foxtel&rsquo;s had the chance to cut costs, including in sports rights.</p>
			<p>Collectively, this has made the business look significantly more attractive than it did 18 months ago.<br>
				Investor considerations</p>
			<p>Be it through a listing, a sale to another media company, or a PE buyout, McLeod proposed that News Corp investors would benefit from the continued simplification of the company and from further strengthening of its cash position.</p>
			<p>Adjusting for debt and Telstra&rsquo;s 35 per cent ownership of Foxtel, McLeod put News Corp&rsquo;s stake in Foxtel to be worth $US700 million, equating to $US1.12 per share.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In our assessment, there is a wide range of sell-side estimates for Foxtel, and we believe its value is not fully reflected in the News Corp share price,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;A clean exit from Foxtel would continue the theme of simplification of the News Corp portfolio of businesses and investments. We think this would contribute to a positive re-rating of News Corp shares, as the previous disposal of non-core assets has done.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Thanks to this, McLeod upped his News Corp price target to $US33 per share, from $US32 per share.<br>

			<p><b><i>Toonz Media Group launches kids TV channel in Indonesia<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.animationxpress.com/latest-news/toonz-media-group-launches-kids-tv-channel-in-indonesia/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Mumbai: Toonz Media Group is launching a new kids TV channel in Indonesia. The 24X7 pay-TV channel Toonz kids will be available on Indonesia&rsquo;s satellite TV network Transvision. The channel will go on air on 14 November.</p>
			<p>The bilingual channel will include shows in both Bahasa and English, and is targeted at four to 12-year-olds. This will be Toonz&rsquo;s maiden television channel in Asia, said the statement.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Indonesia has a fast-growing kids entertainment industry and we felt it would be the best place to launch the expansion of our platform entertainment business,&rdquo; said Toonz Media Group chief executive officer P Jayakumar. &ldquo;We will be banking on Toonz&rsquo;s 22 year old legacy in the industry and our strong multi-genre library with 1000+ hours of content. Toonz Kids will bring this world class content to kids and families in Indonesia, dubbed in native Bahasa.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Toonz had announced expansion of its platform entertainment business in October this year with the constitution of its new SBU Toonz Media Networks. The company has roped in former Zee Entertainment chief operating officer Mukund Cairae to head the SBU. After Indonesia, Toonz plans to launch television channels in other emerging kids&rsquo; television markets such as Malaysia, Singapore and MENA (Middle East and North Africa). The company already operates kids channels in select key global territories.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Indonesia has the largest television market and the second largest pay TV market in South-East Asia. The country has around 67 million homes and a TV penetration of 64 per cent, which translates to around 42 million TV homes. This includes a pay TV penetration of 12 per cent. If you look at the average revenue per user for pay TV in Indonesia, it is a healthy $10 per home per month. Clearly, there is huge potential for growth of pay TV business here,&rdquo; said Toonz Media Networks president Mukund Cairae.</p>
			<p>He added that Toonz Kids will focus on edutainment and entertainment shows while also looking to explore content partnerships through animation co-productions with local companies in Indonesia. &ldquo;We will be actively pursuing content partnerships to co-create premium content, including e-Sports, to engage the tweens and teens besides the kids audience category,&rdquo; Cairae said. </p>
			<p>Cloud broadcasting and live TV streaming company Amagi is the playout and transmission partner for Toonz Kids. Toonz already has a formidable presence in the digital media space with a robust YouTube ecosystem comprising of 18 YouTube channels and 18 million plus subscribers. Earlier this year the company had launched its own OTT platform MyToonz. Besides this, Toonz also has content syndication partnerships with world&rsquo;s top kids&rsquo; VoD platforms including Roku, Kidoodle, Amazon Prime, Pluto TV, and many more.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is the first international kids&rsquo; channel fully dubbed in Bahasa Indonesia. In line with our tagline, &lsquo;broadcasting at the edge of technology&rsquo; we always strive to provide entertaining, quality, and educational content for all of our viewers,&rdquo; said Transvision sales and marketing director Brando Tengdom. &ldquo;We sincerely hope this partnership will accommodate our customer needs, as well as become an attractive point for our customer to access Transvision services.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.lowyat.net/2021/258428/netflix-contents-on-astro-not-censored/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Censorship is synonymous with the content and entertainment industry in Malaysia. As for Netflix, many parties over the years have publicly urged the authorities to censor it including politicians, FINAS, and the now-defunct streaming service Aflix.</p>
			<p>Hence, it is not surprising that the topic appears once again when Astro officially rolled out the Netflix integration into Astra Ultra Box last week. For those who are wondering about this, contents that are being shown on the Netflix app on the Astro connected boxes will not be censored by the company.</p>
			<p>This has been noted on the FAQ section of its official website that is dedicated to the streaming service. Astro&rsquo;s CEO of Pay-TV who is also the Group COO, Euan Smith has also made it clear during last week&rsquo;s launch event that Netflix has full control over its contents.</p>
			<p>There is nothing surprising about this as the Netflix app on Astro connected boxes generally functions just like any other Netflix app out there. Hence, the content came directly from Netflix rather than being fed by Astro.</p>
			<p>This is similar to how Astro has no control over the contents on HBO Go. In fact, the company sometimes may have seen this as an advantage given how it has used the &ldquo;uncensored&rdquo; element as part of the marketing campaign for the Game of Thrones&rsquo; final season back in 2019.</p>
			<p>For concerned parents and guardians out there, do check out this section of Netflix&rsquo;s support site to learn more about Netflix&rsquo;s parental control features which include a dedicated Kids profile, PIN-based profile lock, and the ability to block specific titles.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/SpaceX_deploys_53_Starlink_internet_satellites_from_Falcon_9_rocket_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>SpaceX deployed 53 Starlink Internet satellites into orbit from a Falcon 9 rocket launched Saturday in a foggy flight from Cape Canaveral Space Station, Florida.</p>
			<p>&quot;You can see we did have successful deployment of our Starlink satellites here,&quot; SpaceX Dragon propulsion engineer Youmei Zhou said during live commentary. &quot;Starlink is a satellite Internet constellation designed and manufactured by SpaceX that can provide high-speed, low-latency Internet to people living in remote and rural locations all around the globe.&quot;</p>
			<p>A layer of dense fog hung over the launch site Saturday morning, but it slowly dissipated once the sun came up, allowing for more visibility for the rocket to launch. SpaceX had postponed the launch Friday due to weather concerns.</p>
			<p>Saturday's launch marked the first SpaceX Starlink launch from Florida on one of its 229-foot-tall workhorse Falcon 9 rockets in six months.</p>
			<p>SpaceX also launched a Starlink mission from its California-based launch pad in September.</p>
			<p>The company said the number of launches slowed this year to roll out new satellites equipped with laser-based systems to communicate with each other in orbit.</p>
			<p>The inter-satellite laser communications reduce reliance on ground stations, which are expensive to deploy and may sometimes come with other geographical or political constraints.</p>
			<p>Saturday's flight released the second batch of SpaceX's recently upgraded Starlink Internet satellites.</p>
			<p>SpaceX successfully launched the first batch carrying 51 Starlink satellites into space in September from the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.</p>
			<p>&quot;Inter-satellite laser communications means Starlink can carry data at speed of light in vacuum all around Earth before touching ground,&quot; tweeted SpaceX's founder and CEO Elon Musk. &quot;Over time, some amount of communication can simply be from one user terminal to another without touching the Internet.&quot;</p>
			<p>Since Starlink begin in May 2019, SpaceX has launched some 1,500 satellites into orbit for broadband internet service on the ground.<br>

			<p><b><i>Japan to launch 2nd space defense unit to protect satellites from electromagnetic attack<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacenews.com/japan-to-launch-2nd-space-defense-unit-to-protect-satellites-from-electromagnetic-attack/<br>
			</p>
			<p>SEOUL, South Korea &#151; Japan will launch a second space defense unit at an airbase in the country&rsquo;s west within the next 18 months to monitor electromagnetic wave threats to its satellites.</p>
			<p>Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi announced the plan of establishing the second Space Operations Squadron at the Hofu Kita Air Base in Yamaguchi Prefecture Nov. 14, saying it&rsquo;s &ldquo;extremely important to secure the stable use of outer space,&rdquo; according to a statement. The unit would be established during Japan&rsquo;s fiscal 2022, which begins April 1.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;As we expand our operations in new domains &#151; the fields of outer space, cyberspace and the electromagnetic spectrum &#151; it is extremely important to secure the stable use of outer space,&rdquo; the defense minister said. &ldquo;The location was selected after considering various factors comprehensively.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The new squadron&rsquo;s establishment is &ldquo;part of Japan&rsquo;s efforts to beef up its capabilities in new domains such as outer space, as China and Russia are building up their own capacity in the electromagnetic spectrum,&rdquo; according to Kyodo News. A space surveillance radar is already being built at the airbase for its full operation in 2023, it reported.</p>
			<p>Japan opened its first Space Operations Squadron in May 2020 at an airbase in Fuchu, western Tokyo, tasked with monitoring space debris, asteroids and other threats to its satellites.</p>
			<p>The second squadron&rsquo;s establishment indicates that Japan would further deepen its cooperation with the United States on space security issues. Japan&rsquo;s Self-Defense Force has tried to expand its cooperation and weapons compatibility with the U.S. Space Force, as it increasingly works alongside American troops and as it grows concerned about the increasing capabilities of China. A case in point was the space security collaboration agreement signed in March between Japan Air Self-Defense Force and the U.S. Space Command. Under the agreement, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force has assigned a liaison officer full-time at U.S. Space Command headquarters at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado. Japan has also been operating the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System since November 2018, a homegrown geolocation system that enhances the regional accuracy of GPS-based timing and navigation services. The U.S. Space Force is in charge of operating the GPS system.</p>
			<p>On the civil space front, Japan joined NASA&rsquo;s Artemis program in October 2020 and this has paved the way for Japanese organizations to participate in the U.S.-led lunar exploration. While Tokyo-based ispace, for example, is developing a robotic lunar lander to compete for NASA commercial payload contracts, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has agreed to contribute key components of lunar Gateway, a the space station NASA and its partners aim to build near the moon to support surface operations. <br>

			<p><b><i>US accuses Russia of &lsquo;dangerous&rsquo; behavior after anti-satellite weapons test<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/nov/15/us-investigating-debris-event-space-reports-russia-anti-satellite-weapon-test<br>
			</p>
			<p>Russia fired missile at its own satellite, generating debris that US says &lsquo;threatens interests of all nations&rsquo;</p>
			<p>Astronauts on the International Space Station were forced to prepare for a possible evacuation.</p>
			<p>The US has accused Russia of &ldquo;dangerous and irresponsible behavior&rdquo; after it conducted an anti-satellite weapons test that forced astronauts on the International Space Station to prepare for evacuation.</p>
			<p>Russia fired a missile at one of its own satellites over the weekend, generating more than 1,500 pieces of trackable orbital debris and hundreds of pieces of smaller debris, which the US said &ldquo;now threaten the interests of all nations&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Astronauts aboard the ISS floated into special &ldquo;lifeboat&rdquo; pods following the release of the debris. The pods can detach from the ISS and fly crews back to Earth.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This test will significantly increase the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station, as well as to other human spaceflight activities,&rdquo; said Ned Price, a spokesman for the US state department, on Monday.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Russia&rsquo;s dangerous and irresponsible behavior jeopardizes the long-term sustainability of outer space and clearly demonstrates that Russia&rsquo;s claims of opposing the weaponization of space are disingenuous and hypocritical.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The United States will work with our allies and partners to respond to Russia&rsquo;s irresponsible act.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The UK defence minister Ben Wallace said: &ldquo;This destructive anti-satellite missile test by Russia shows a complete disregard for the security, safety and sustainability of space.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Anti-satellite weapons tests are rare and are criticized by the space community, due to the risk they create for crews in low Earth orbit. Last year US space command accused Russia of having &ldquo;made space a warfighting domain&rdquo; after it fired a missile at a satellite as part of a weapons test.</p>
			<p>The Russian military and ministry of defense did not immediately comment.</p>
			<p>Earlier on Monday, amid reports that Russia had conducted an anti-weapons test, Nasa&rsquo;s Russian counterpart, Roscomos, tweeted that the ISS crew had been forced to move into spacecraft owing to an &ldquo;object&rdquo; orbiting the Earth.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Friends, everything is regular with us! We continue to work according to the program,&rdquo; Anton Shkaplerov, the current commander of the outpost, tweeted.</p>
			<p>The Nasa astronauts Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, Kayla Barron, and the European Space Agency astronaut Matthias Maurer floated into their SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft for safety, according to a report by Spaceflight Now.</p>
			<p>At the same time, the Russian cosmonauts Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov and the Nasa astronaut Mark Vande Hei boarded a Soyuz spacecraft on the Russian segment, Spaceflight Now said.</p>
			<p>Experts say anti-satellite weapons that shatter their targets pose a space hazard by creating a cloud of fragments that can collide with other objects, which can set off a chain reaction of projectiles through Earth orbit.</p>
			<p>The US performed the first anti-satellite weapon test in 1959, when satellites themselves were new and rare. The US fired an &ldquo;air-launched ballistic missile&rdquo; from a B-47 bomber at the Explorer VI satellite, but missed.</p>
			<p>Russia conducted three anti-satellite missile tests in 2020, according to Space.com. Following the launch of an anti-satellite missile by Russia last December, Gen James Dickinson, the US space command commander, criticized the country for &ldquo;persistent testing&rdquo; of &ldquo;space-based and ground-based weapons intended to target and destroy satellites&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Russia publicly claims it is working to prevent the transformation of outer space into a battlefield, yet at the same time Moscow continues to weaponize space by developing and fielding on-orbit and ground-based capabilities that seek to exploit US reliance on space-based systems,&rdquo; Dickinson said.</p>
			<p>He added: &ldquo;We stand ready and committed to deter aggression and defend our nation and our allies from hostile acts in space.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The US military is increasingly dependent on satellites to determine what it does on the ground, guiding munitions with space-based lasers and satellites as well as using such assets to monitor for missile launches and track its forces.</p>
			<p>The anti-satellite weapons tests have also raised questions about the long-term sustainability of operations in space that are essential to a huge range of commercial activities, including banking and GPS services.<br>

			<p>The Waihopai Valley spy base domes in rural Marlborough might be notorious for their role gathering international intelligence, but no-one is exactly celebrating their demise.</p>
			<p>The radomes cover antennae that were installed about 30 years ago to gather intelligence by monitoring satellite communications, now managed by the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB).</p>
			<p>Minister for the Intelligence Agencies Andrew Little on Wednesday evening said the GCSB no longer needed the radomes, as their technology had been superseded by online signals intelligence gathering. The antennae yielded less than 0.5 per cent of the intelligence used in GCSB reports in the past year.</p>
			<p>The radomes and dishes will be removed in 2022.</p>
			<p>Protesters had been calling for the domes to be dismantled for decades, saying that when that intelligence was shared with Five Eyes partners &#150; the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia &#150; it made New Zealand complicit in the military campaigns of those countries, among other criticisms.</p>
			<p>However, Anti-Bases Campaign (ABC) organiser Murray Horton said news of the domes&rsquo; redundancy was nothing to celebrate, since the base itself would continue to operate at the site, &ldquo;albeit without its most conspicuous physical features that stick out like dogs' balls&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;ABC has consistently called for Waihopai to be closed. Not to be made a more modernised, efficient spy base, using different spying methods, which is what Andrew Little has announced,&rdquo; Horton said.</p>
			<p>Horton, who helped organise the annual January protest at the base every year since 1988, said he was not surprised the radomes and dishes were no longer of use.</p>
			<p>Anti-Bases Campaign organiser Murray Horton speaks at the annual Waihopai spy base protest in January.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re 1980s technology, dating back to the era of landlines, fax machines and video cassette recorders,&rdquo; Horton said.</p>
			<p>The annual protest would go ahead on January 29, Horton said. &ldquo;ABC still continues to call for the closure of Waihopai.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Just down the road from the spy base gates, the Spy Valley Wine headquarters overlooks their namesake and the site of the annual protest. The company has been growing grapes and making wine in the valley since the 1990s.</p>
			<p>Marketing and sales manager Daniel Adriatico said the domes had been part of the company&rsquo;s marketing imagery for a long time. &ldquo;We like to say, &lsquo;Good terroir for great wine makes great places for spy bases.&rsquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely a bittersweet thing ... Having the base there is definitely a big part of our branding &#150; we will definitely be missing it,&rdquo; Adriatico said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a huge part of the valley ... You come over that bend [on Waihopai Valley Rd] and the domes are right there &#150; it&rsquo;s pretty cool.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Two faint domes made it into the Spy Valley Wines banner at the 2012 Marlborough Holiday Expo. Spy Valley cellar door manager Nicola Clark pours the 2011 sauvignon blanc for Blenheim couple Joyce and Richard Sutcliffe.</p>
			<p>Cellar door guests loved being able to see the base, and the winery had a good relationship with spy base staff, often hosting MPs and other personnel visiting the base, Adriatico said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to buy one of the balls, use the fabric to make something ... It&rsquo;s one of those historic things and we&rsquo;d like to have a piece of it here.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Little said on Wednesday the GCSB received a further $150 million funding from the Government in the 2019 and 2020 Budgets, roughly half of which was to acquire new spying capabilities.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;There's a lot of data and intelligence processing that happens down there, so [the base is] not just serving the needs of the domes and the dishes in it.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He said it was &ldquo;hard to be specific&rdquo; about the type of capabilities the GCSB was now using or was seeking, but the agency by law had authority &ldquo;to get access to information infrastructures, and that&rsquo;s what they do&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Little said New Zealand&rsquo;s Five Eyes partners had been accepting and supportive of the decision to dismantle the domes.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You can conclude that if the GCSB was only gathering half a per cent of their intelligence through this means, then it wasn't a huge contributor to the broader Five Eyes relationship.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>GCSB Director-General Andrew Hampton said the dishes had become &ldquo;virtually obsolete&rdquo; and would have required significant investment to continue operating.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Changes in global telecommunications and information technology mean the interception of satellite communications from Waihopai has declined over the years,&rdquo; Hampton said in a statement.<br>

			<p><b><i>The death of the domes: GCSB spy chief on the changing nature of electronic spying<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300453599/the-death-of-the-domes-gcsb-spy-chief-on-the-changing-nature-of-electronic-spying<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Waihopai spy domes may be coming down after three decades of listening in on transmissions, but the electronic spying won&rsquo;t stop.</p>
			<p>The two domes, massive air-inflated white orbs that surround 18-metre satellite dishes in the Waihopai Valley south of Blenheim, have been a feature on New Zealand&rsquo;s political landscape and a lightning rod for protest for years.</p>
			<p>They&rsquo;ve been seen as a visual marker of New Zealand&rsquo;s participation in United States-led wars, a site of annual pilgrimage for opponents of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing arrangement, and at the centre of claims that New Zealanders are subject to a global surveillance system.</p>
			<p>And, as the nature of electronic spying has changed, they&rsquo;ve become redundant for the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), one of New Zealand&rsquo;s intelligence agencies.</p>
			<p>&quot;You have less global telecommunications transmitted via satellites and much more of it's been transmitted through cables, the world's cabled up,&rdquo; GCSB director-general Andrew Hampton said in an interview this week.</p>
			<p>&quot;You also have other technology changes, such as encryption, so even if you capture a satellite communication, if it's encrypted you're not necessarily going to be able to do much with it.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;And then the other thing is, there's been this big development called the Internet.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The GCSB on Thursday announced it would decommission and dismantle the radomes in 2022, as they had yielded intelligence used in only 0.5 per cent of the agency&rsquo;s report in the past year, and would require investment to run in the future. The money would be better spent elsewhere, Hampton said.<br>
				GCSB director-general Andrew Hampton says the two radomes will go but the base itself will remain.</p>
			<p>The base itself will remain. It has another &ldquo;newer, more versatile&rdquo; satellite interception dish, Hampton said, and other technology operated by a trained workforce &ldquo;who possibly wouldn't want to live in one of the big cities&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>There were also risks with centralising all the agency&rsquo;s assets in Wellington, &ldquo;particularly if we&rsquo;re worried about things like earthquakes&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>The first of the dishes came into use in 1989, with the second being constructed in the late 90s. In 1996, the orbs featured on the cover of journalist Nicky Hager&rsquo;s book Secret Power.</p>
			<p>In the book, Hager detailed the GCSB&rsquo;s origins, how the domes were used, and advocated for an end to New Zealand&rsquo;s participation in intelligence-sharing &#150; saying the GCSB&rsquo;s priorities were set by the larger partners in the Five Eyes alliance and did not actually defend New Zealanders.</p>
			<p>In 2014, the GCSB was alleged to be part of a &ldquo;mass metadata surveillance system&rdquo; by former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, who said the use of a system named &ldquo;XKEYSCORE&rdquo; allowed the GCSB &ldquo;granular access to the database of communications collected in the course of mass surveillance&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Hager, who published stories in the Sunday Star Times about files Snowden made public, on Friday said the GCSB maintained numerous more sophisticated satellite dishes at the Waihopai base, including a large torus antenna visible on satellite imagery, which can be directed at multiple satellites at once.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In terms of the familiar picture people have of the base, it&rsquo;s going to be a big change. But in terms of the interception capability, the change with these ones going is negligible,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Big is not the point, it&rsquo;s actually capacity.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Hampton said the idea that the dishes within the domes &ldquo;suck up all of the communications that have been transmitted around this part of the world at any one time&rdquo; was completely off the mark.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We don't do mass-surveillance. We don't just gather up data and roam around looking for stuff. There's always got to be a purpose for it, it's got to be necessary, and it's got to be proportionate.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>If all the satellite communications that the Waihopai dishes could suck up were an Olympic-sized swimming pool, the GCSB would access only half a bucket of it, Hampton said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You may only take it for five minutes or 10 minutes. And then you filter out the stuff that you don't want.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Obviously, an organisation like ours deals with data and deals with big volumes of data, and we need to have tools by which we can separate out the information of intelligence interest from other information.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Hampton would not speak in any detail about the GCSB&rsquo;s current spying capabilities, but pointed to the agency&rsquo;s legislation which grants it the power to, under warrants, &ldquo;access an information infrastructure&rdquo; &#150; covertly reaching through the Internet to access communications.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I'm not going to be able to talk in specifics about that, but that essentially involves being able to access digital communications of targets.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He said the GCSB had provided &ldquo;meaningful&rdquo; intelligence to counter-terror efforts of other Five Eyes agencies, transnational crime investigations led by police, policy issues such as climate change, and New Zealand&rsquo;s military deployments &#150; including the recent evacuation of New Zealanders from Afghanistan.</p>
			<p>&quot;One of the theses behind that book [Secret Power] was we were somehow tasked by the US and others. Everything New Zealand does is in accordance with New Zealand's intelligence priorities, and accordance with our legal authorities.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Because the spying will continue, so will the protests. A group of protesters who descend upon Waihopai annually have declared they will continue to do so, and the Green Party agrees that the spy base itself must be shut.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It is here to stay,&rdquo; Hampton said.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.space.com/china-yaogan-35-reconnaissance-satellites-launch-november-2021<br>
			</p>
			<p>China streaks ahead in global launch race for 2021.</p>
			<p>China launched the first set of three satellites for a new series of classified Yaogan reconnaissance satellites on Saturday (Nov. 5), continuing the country's rapid rate of orbital missions.</p>
			<p>A Long March 2D lifted off at 10:00 p.m. EST (0300 GMT, 11:00 a.m. local Time), rising into blue skies over the wooded hills surrounding the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China.</p>
			<p>Chinese state media described the Yaogan 35 A, B and C satellites as to be used for scientific experiments, land and resources surveys, agricultural production estimates and disaster prevention and mitigation.</p>
			<p>It is believed that Yaogan satellites are for military purposes, similar to how Russia and the U.S. use &quot;Kosmos&quot; and &quot;USA&quot; designations respectively for military satellites, as NASASpaceFlight notes.</p>
			<p>The satellites are now orbiting at roughly 310 miles (500 kilometers) above the Earth, with an inclination of 35 degrees, similar to many earlier Yaogan series satellites, but at a lower altitude.</p>
			<p>Unusually, the orbiting Yaogan trio were developed by separate groups. The A and B satellites were developed by the Aerospace Dongfanghong Satellite Co., Ltd. under the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST), while the &quot;C&quot; satellite was developed by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology (CAST).</p>
			<p>Both CAST and SAST belong to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), China&rsquo;s main, state-owned space contractor. </p>
			<p>The flight was China&rsquo;s 43rd orbital launch of 2021, further extending a new national record for launches in a calendar year set in October.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/European_software_defined_satellite_starts_service_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>A telecommunications satellite that can be reprogrammed in-orbit, offering unprecedented mission reconfiguration capacity, has successfully passed its in-orbit acceptance review.</p>
			<p>Developed under an ESA Partnership Project with satellite operator Eutelsat and prime manufacturer Airbus, Eutelsat Quantum is pioneering a new wave of flexible satellites developed with the European space industry.</p>
			<p>The satellite was launched on 30 July on board an Ariane 5 from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana and reached its final orbit position a few days later at 48 E covering a wide angle from West Africa to the Strait of Malacca in South East Asia.</p>
			<p>Since then, it has been fully end-to-end tested and commissioned, its performance has been verified and its ground operations validated.</p>
			<p>The flexible software-defined satellite is now ready to enter commercial service and will provide data and mobile communications for governments and other users through its France-based operator, Eutelsat.</p>
			<p>Because it can be reprogrammed in orbit, and at any time, it can respond to changing demands for data transmission and secure communications during its 15-year lifetime.</p>
			<p>Its beams can be reshaped and redirected to move in almost real time to provide information to passengers on board moving planes, ships, trucks and cars. The beams also can be easily adjusted to deliver more data when demand surges.</p>
			<p>The satellite can detect and characterise any rogue emissions, enabling it to respond dynamically to any accidental interference or intentional jamming.</p>
			<p>Eutelsat Quantum is a UK flagship project with most of the satellite developed and manufactured by British industry. Airbus was the prime contractor and was responsible for building the satellite's innovative payload, while Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd manufactured the new platform. The innovative phase array antenna was developed by Airbus in Spain.</p>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/11/11/aerospace-industry-calls-for-c-band-5g-rollout-delay/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Trade body the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) is leading a coalition of organisations representing the world&rsquo;s leading aerospace manufacturers, airlines, pilots, and operators in calling for a delay to the deployment of 5G technologies to the C-band until the safety and efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS) is ensured.</p>
			<p>In a letter to the National Economic Council (NEC), the coalition urges collaboration with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to convene a joint industry working group to bring the aviation and telecommunications industries together to find a long-term solution that will protect the flying public by ensuring radio altimeters operate accurately while allowing 5G to roll out safely.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We believe it is incumbent on the National Economic Council to work with the FCC and FAA to convene a joint industry working group and continue to delay the deployment of 5G technologies in this band until the safety and efficiency of the NAS is ensured,&rdquo; they write. &ldquo;The goal of this working group would be to reach acceptable mitigations. Aviation will not be able to maintain the current level of public safety and economic activity without support from the Biden-Harris Administration and the implementation of mitigations by the cellular industry.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The letter comes on the heels of the FAA issuing a bulletin alerting manufacturers, operators, and pilots that action may be needed to address potential interference with radio altimeters caused by 5G systems. Radio altimeters are crucial systems used by every commercial aircraft and helicopter and many general aviation aircraft.</p>
			<p>Joining AIA on the letter is the Aerospace Vehicle Systems Institute, the Air Line Pilots Association International, the Airborne Public Safety Association, Airbus, the Aircraft Electronics Association, the Aircraft Owners &amp; Pilots Association, Airlines for America, Aviation Spectrum Resources, Inc., the Boeing Company, the Cargo Airline Association, Collins Aerospace, the Experimental Aircraft Association, Free Flight Systems, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, Garmin International, Inc., the Helicopter Association International, Honeywell International Inc., the International Air Transport Association, the National Air Carrier Association, the National Business Aviation Association, and the Regional Airline Association.<br>

			<p><b><i>Report: Asia streaming adoption up 46% YoY <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/11/12/report-asia-streaming-adoption-up-46-yoy/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Despite predictions of a &lsquo;pandemic peak&rsquo;, streaming adoption continues to gain ground worldwide and Asia is no exception, experiencing 46 per cent year-over-year growth in Q3 2021 according to the Q3 2021 State of Streaming: Asia report from Conviva, the continuous measurement platform for streaming media.</p>
			<p>Asia&rsquo;s streaming growth was led by the western and southeastern regions of Asia, which increased 200 per cent and 164 per cent, respectively, with the eastern and central regions showing more modest growth at 34 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively.</p>
			<p>Conviva&rsquo;s data also showed Asia consistently consumed streaming content on smaller screens, with desktop (49 per cent) and mobile (33 per cent) viewing taking the top spots in viewing time by device for the third quarter. Big screen viewing, which consists of connected TVs, smart TVs and gaming consoles, was low in Asia compared to the rest of the world, with just 14 per cent share of viewing time. Western Asia was the only region to watch predominantly on the big screen.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Streaming viewership in Asia &#150; and worldwide &#150; shows no signs of slowing, making it imperative for publishers to focus on delivering the best possible viewing experience in this region,&rdquo; said Keith Zubchevich, CEO, Conviva. &ldquo;By focusing on optimising experience and viewer engagement, publishers can not only expand their audience internationally, but also drive consumer loyalty in Asia that will yield dividends for years to come.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Android TV Continues Dominance in Asia</p>
			<p>Despite big screen viewing time receiving only 14 per cent share of the overall viewing time in Asia, Android TV, with 52 per cent of the big screen share, was solidly Asia&rsquo;s television of choice. Amazon Fire TV was second with 22 per cent followed distantly by Samsung TV with 8 per cent and LG TV with 6 per cent share.</p>
			<p>Asia Continues to Struggle with Quality</p>
			<p>Quality remained a mix bag for the region. Asia recorded the worst buffering percentage globally at 0.98 per cent, yet all global regions were under 1 per cent for the first time &#150; a significant accomplishment. Asia was also the only region to see no improvement year over year in picture quality and offered the lowest bitrate of any region at 2.20 Mbps. Fortunately, Asia did see an improvement in video start failures, down from 44 per cent to 1.13 per cent, but worsened 35 per cent in the time it took for videos to play.</p>
			<p>Asian Sports Leagues Leverage Video to Drive Engagement</p>
			<p>Asian sports leagues, including the Indian Premier League (IPL), Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) and the Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) recognised the benefit of using social video to reach their fans and saw a significant increase in engagement year over year with total cross-platform engagements up by 36 per cent, despite a 19 per cent decrease in videos posted. The IPL saw the biggest year-over-year increase in engagement, up 201 per cent in July, 32 per cent in August and 23 per cent in September.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/waihopai-valley-spy-domes-iconic-yet-obsolete-will-come-down-as-gcsb-moves-to-new-technology/HZMLR5T2E6UM47NI2CXZZHAE6E/#<br>
			</p>
			<p>The spy domes emblematic of secret surveillance in New Zealand are past their use-by date and are to be dismantled.</p>
			<p>After more than four decades of snooping, the dishes built at Waihopai Valley in the Marlborough Sounds to intercept satellite communications have become obsolete and now collected a fraction of the intelligence they once did.</p>
			<p>The Government Communications Security Bureau built the first of the two 18-metre dishes in 1989, adding a second dish in 1998. The dishes were covered by a distinctive cover known as a radome, giving a golf ball-like appearance.</p>
			<p>GCSB Minister Andrew Little said &quot;yesterday's tools&quot; weren't necessarily useful in meeting the intelligence needs of a modern and future world.</p>
			<p>&quot;They are an iconic feature of our landscape but the reality is technology has moved on. There's different kinds of ways of collecting the kind of data they would collect so they are now obsolete.&quot;</p>
			<p>Exactly what that replacement technology was, Little would not say. The Herald asked specifically about a GCSB plan called Speargun, canned in 2013, which would have tapped New Zealand's main internet cable.</p>
			<p>&quot;It's not for me to confirm or deny claims about what that technology is except to say everything our agencies do has to fit under our legal framework, has to be mandated and authorised and I'm confident our agencies do that.&quot;</p>
			<p>While the dishes were coming down, the Waihopai base would remain. Little said the Blenheim station was able to do more than simply manage the intercepted communications that came from the domes.</p>
			<p>&quot;It processes a lot of data, processes a lot of intelligence. The facility will remain.&quot;</p>
			<p>Little didn't respond to questions about the XKeyscore system which showed the Waihopai station was among a network of secret bases across the world in documents released by whistleblower Edward Snowden. XKeyscore was purported to be a global Five Eyes network that allowed analysis and search of anything on the internet.</p>
			<p>Little reiterated the value of the GCSB, saying intelligence collected by it had recently disrupted planning of a terrorist attack overseas. He said the GCSB received $150m across the 2019 and 2020 budgets of which half was to fund new capabilities.</p>
			<p>He said he wasn't provided any advice around the cost of upgrading or modernising the domes. He was unsure what was planned for the decommissioned domes. &quot;I'm not sure they'd fit at Te Papa.&quot;</p>
			<p>GCSB director-general Andrew Hampton said less than 0.5 per cent of the GCSB's intelligence reports were based on dish collection from Waihopai.</p>
			<p>The interception of satellite communications from Waihopai had dropped so much that &quot;dish use is now virtually obsolete&quot;.</p>
			<p>Hampton said the dishes had reached the end of their structural life and would have required considerable funding to stay operational. The money was being spent on other intelligence capabilities, he said.</p>
			<p>The Waihopai base featured in a series of NZ Herald stories in 2015 on how &quot;full take&quot; collection of communications across the Pacific was highly likely to include that of New Zealand citizens.</p>
			<p>An inquiry by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security found lawful authorisation was in place to allow the GCSB to collect communications relating to New Zealand's interests in the South Pacific.</p>
			<p>&quot;I did not find evidence to suggest that the GCSB operated beyond the scope of these authorisations, including by use of 'full take' collection.&quot;<br>

			<p><b><i>Rocket Lab to launch satellites, recover booster tonight. How to watch live.<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.space.com/rocket-lab-love-at-first-insight-launch-booster-recovery-webcast<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Electron launch is scheduled for 11:25 p.m. EST (0425 GMT on Nov. 11).</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab plans to recover a booster after launching two satellites to orbit tonight (Nov. 10), and you can watch the action live.</p>
			<p>A two-stage Electron rocket topped with two commercial Earth-observation satellites is scheduled to lift off tonight from Rocket Lab's New Zealand site at 11:25 p.m. EST (0425 GMT on Nov. 11). If all goes according to plan, shortly after liftoff, the Electron's first stage will splash down softly in the Pacific Ocean under parachutes, and Rocket Lab teams will fish it out of the sea.</p>
			<p>You can watch it all live here at Space.com, courtesy of Rocket Lab, as well as on this page and directly via the company. Coverage will begin about 20 minutes before launch.</p>
			<p>The main goal of tonight's mission, which Rocket Lab calls &quot;Love at First Insight,&quot; is to deliver two satellites to orbit for the company BlackSky. But the booster recovery is an important sidelight, because it will inform Rocket Lab's quest to make the Electron's first stage reusable.</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab has conducted two Electron recoveries already, during missions that launched in November 2020 and May 2021. But tonight's attempt will be the first to include a helicopter, which will be stationed in the recovery zone about 230 miles (370 kilometers) off the New Zealand coast.</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab plans to eventually pluck each falling Electron first stage out of the sky with a helicopter, and tonight's activities will provide a sort of dry run for that ambitious plan.</p>
			<p>&quot;The helicopter will not attempt a mid-air capture for this mission but will test communications and tracking to refine the concept of operations (CONOPS) for future Electron aerial capture,&quot; Rocket Lab representatives wrote in a preview of tonight's mission.</p>
			<p>The 59-foot-tall (18 meters) Electron gives small satellites dedicated rides to orbit. &quot;Love At First Insight&quot; will be the rocket's 22nd launch overall and its fifth of 2021. </p>
			<p>One of this year's flights &#151; the May 2021 launch that featured a successful booster recovery &#151; attempted to loft two BlackSky satellites. But an anomaly occurred in the Electron's upper stage engine igniter system, resulting in the loss of both satellites.</p>
			<p>If &quot;Love At First Insight&quot; does not get off the ground tonight, it will have other chances; the launch window runs through Nov. 24.<br>

			<p><b><i>China and Africa to promote Beidou-based services<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://satelliteprome.com/news/china-and-africa-to-promote-beidou-based-services/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The participants at the forum included representatives from nearly 50 African nations.</p>
			<p>China and Africa will strengthen their communication and cooperation in promoting and using the Beidou Navigation Satellite System, according to an international forum in Beijing.</p>
			<p>Officials, industry leaders and researchers from China, several African nations and the African Union shared their thoughts at the First China-Africa Beidou System Cooperation Forum in Beijing and agreed to take advantage of the Beidou system to benefit social and economic development in Africa.</p>
			<p>He Yubin, Chairman of China Satellite Navigation Committee, said at the forum that his committee is willing to share its experience and expertise of Beidou&rsquo;s applications with Africa and work with African countries to design Beidou-based solutions for their socio-economic development.</p>
			<p>China will join hands with Africa to promote Beidou-based services on the continent to foster local industries and businesses and help to create more jobs and reduce poverty.</p>
			<p>Xu Hongliang, secretary-general of China National Space Administration, added the administration is dedicated to sharing China&rsquo;s space achievements with Africa to nurture the continent&rsquo;s science and technology. It is also determined to improve space industry professionals&rsquo; exchanges and training to facilitate African countries&rsquo; efforts to enhance their own space capability.</p>
			<p>Yang Changfeng, Beidou&rsquo;s chief architect, read a document at the forum about both sides&rsquo; vision for promoting cooperation in Beidou applications.</p>
			<p>Beidou is currently China&rsquo;s largest space-based system and one of the four global navigation networks, along with the United States&rsquo; GPS, Russia&rsquo;s GLONASS and the European Union&rsquo;s Galileo.</p>
			<p>In June 2020, the final satellite to complete Beidou&rsquo;s third-generation network was lifted by a Long March 3B carrier rocket at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan province and was placed into a geostationary orbit about 36,000 kilometres above the Earth.</p>
			<p>Since 2000, a total of 59 Beidou satellites, including the first four experimental ones, have been launched from Xichang on 44 Long March 3-series rockets, with some of them having retired.</p>
			<p>Beidou began providing positioning, navigation, timing and messaging services to civilian users in China and other parts of the Asia-Pacific region in December 2012. At the end of 2018, it started providing basic global services.</p>
			<p>Now, there are 30 third-generation Beidou satellites in three types of orbit &#151; 24 in medium-Earth orbits, three in inclined geosynchronous satellite orbits and three in geostationary orbits.<br>

			<p><b><i>First satellite created entirely by Vietnamese engineers takes orbit<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.phnompenhpost.com/lifestyle/first-satellite-created-entirely-vietnamese-engineers-takes-orbit<br>
			</p>
			<p>NanoDragon, the first satellite made entirely by Vietnamese engineers, lifted off from the Uchinoura Space Centre in Japan on Tuesday.</p>
			<p>After three previous failed launch attempts due to a combination of bad weather and technical problems, at 7.55am local time the Epsilon 5 rocket blasted into space from the Japanese town of Kimotsuki, Kagoshima Prefecture.</p>
			<p>On board the rocket, NanoDragon was due to separate and go into orbit at 9:07am (local time).</p>
			<p>NanoDragon, which is 100x100x340.5mm in size and weighs 3.8kg, is the first satellite that was researched, designed and manufactured entirely in Vietnam.</p>
			<p>Vu Hong Nam, Vietnamese ambassador to Japan, said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s touching to witness the historic moment when Japan&rsquo;s Epsilon 5 carrying our satellite NanoDragon was launched into the orbit.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to see the achievements of Vietnam&rsquo;s space industry. The launch of this satellite has significant meaning, showing a great stride that Vietnamese engineers have made in designing and manufacturing satellites.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It also affirms the determination of our country in developing the space industry.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Pham Anh Tuan director-general of the Vietnam National Space Centre, said: &ldquo;NanoDragon is a research satellite with a number of benefits.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It can be used to receive signals to identify vessels, through AIS (Automatic Identification System) to avoid collisions or to monitor vessels and vehicles at sea. From this, we can consider using micro satellites with similar features to NanoDragon for related services and activities.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is also an opportunity for us to accumulate experience, develop a team, establish a supplier network, improve the process, and it can serve as the foundation for the development of other made-in-Vietnam satellites.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>According to Tuan, Vietnam started studying space science and technology in the 1980s. But it only focused on such fields as satellite technology in 2006 to implement the strategy for research and application of space technology until 2020.</p>
			<p>Vietnam has achieved certain results in its space industry which include launching two telecommunications satellites, an earth observation satellite and systems of satellite receivers and control stations, and developing three small satellites namely PicoDragon, MicroDragon and NanoDragon.</p>
			<p>The Vietnam National Space Centre is established with three main tasks &#150; establishing technical infrastructure, training highly qualified staff and receiving satellite technology transfer towards the goal of mastering the satellite development technology, according to the head of the centre.</p>
			<p>Currently there is no specific standard to measure the level of space technology development of countries, but one can classify according to some milestones such as: countries with independent orbital launch capabilities, those that own satellites in orbit, and those that do not yet own satellites.</p>
			<p>Vietnam owns six satellites operating in orbit, including two telecommunications satellites and an earth observation satellite and three research satellites.</p>
			<p>Among them, three were bought from commercial companies around the world and three satellites were developed by Vietnamese engineers.</p>
			<p>The satellite is part of a national research project on space technology in 2016-2020 conducted by the Vietnam National Space Centre (VNSC).</p>
			<p>Previously, two other satellites were sent into orbit, but they were created with the assistance of engineers from Japan.</p>
			<p>NanoDragon was among nine satellites carried by the Epsilon 5 rocket, which measures 2.6m in diameter, 26m in length and weighs 96 tonnes. Tuesday&rsquo;s mission was the largest undertaken by Epsilon to date.</p>
			<p>The Vietnamese satellite is tasked with two important missions &#150; checking the entry and exit of vessels through AIS (Automatic Identification System), and taking aerial photos to help scientists perfect satellite navigation systems.</p>
			<p>There are also challenges for Vietnam&rsquo;s space industry Limited access to components and high cost of material in developing satellites in Vietnam.</p>
			<p>Tuan said: &ldquo;Satellites operate in extremely harsh environments characterised by factors like high vacuum, weightlessness, high energy rays and particles, which are completely different from the environment on the ground.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Satellites work in special environments and conditions, so they need strict and good quality management and monitoring process.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The components on the satellite need to be small in weight and size, highly efficient, and capable of operating in harsh environments. Those are high-tech products and often used in the defence industry, so access to these products is limited and that leads to high cost.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;For Vietnam, we also have to face other challenges such as lack of human resources and infrastructure, low investment, limited awareness of satellite technology which then affect the participation of economic sectors in the supply chain.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The infrastructure of the VNSC is still limited with a lack of a complete system with a research centre, ground station and testing equipment.</p>
			<p>Funds for research and development of satellites is also limited as the budget is for manufacturing satellites only and other costs like launching the satellite are not included, according to Tuan.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Vietnam is also among ITAR [International Traffic in Arms Regulations] Prohibited Countries so we cannot access certain types of high-tech products,&rdquo; Tuan said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The supporting industry in Vietnam is also limited. Small companies&rsquo; technical level is still weak while companies with good technology are often not interested in manufacturing single products with a low profit margin,&rdquo; he added. <br>

			<p><b><i>Discovery announces two new TV channels for NZ, more local content, changes to AM Show<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/discovery-announces-two-new-tv-channels-for-nz-more-local-content-changes-to-am-show/2QB3Q6XE4QAITO6WBXFFIOQ2XE/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Media giant Discovery has announced it will be launching two new free-to-air television channels in New Zealand.</p>
			<p>The company, which owns channel Three, Bravo, Newshub and the ThreeNow streaming app, made the announcements during its 2021 showcase of upcoming content.</p>
			<p>The first of the new channels, Gusto, will replace Choice TV and offer a range of local and international entertainment content targeted at 40- to 54-year-olds. Launch titles will include Changing Rooms UK, Big Family Farm and Finding Alice as well as the world premiere of New Zealand production Great Southern Truckers.</p>
			<p>The second channel, Rush, will be skewed to a younger, male audience, with a range of popular survival and adventure shows. Launch titles on this channel will include Wheeler Dealers, Man vs Wild, Street Outlaws and Treehouse Masters.</p>
			<p>This is the first major showcase from Discovery since the company acquired the television arm of MediaWorks in 2020 and offers a glimpse at the intentions of the company for the local market.</p>
			<p>Glen Kyne, senior vice president and general manager for Discovery across Australia and New Zealand, further pointed out there would be a significant increase in the amount of local content from previous years.</p>
			<p>He said that nearly 43 per cent of content across all hours of the day would be local content, up from 35 per cent.</p>
			<p>In terms of what viewers can expect, Kyne said that Discovery would deliver a mix of the familiar and formats that New Zealanders hadn't seen before.</p>
			<p>Kyne pinpointed a new show called Tracked, which will feature New Zealanders dropped off in a remote location and then chased down by other competitors, as an example of some of the content that New Zealanders can look forward to.</p>
			<p>Another show given a splash today was Nadia's Farm, which will give a glimpse into the life of celebrity chef Nadia Lim as she pursues sustainable living at her lifestyle block.</p>
			<p>Asked whether it made sense for a media company to be launching not one but two television channels at a time when viewers were increasingly migrating online, Kyne said he still believed there was room for the network to expand its audience.</p>
			<p>&quot;These are very targeted channels,&quot; he said, explaining that the aim of these channels isn't to capture everyone.</p>
			<p>Instead, they are focused on specific audiences that tend to be coveted by advertisers.</p>
			<p>Women aged between 40 and 54 tend to make the vast majority of the household shopping decisions, while younger men tend to be a tough audience to reach &#150; even via online channels.</p>
			<p>Kyne sees Gusto as a companion channel to reality-heavy Bravo, while Rush will lean into the younger male audience with shows focused on adrenaline junkies and action.</p>
			<p>&quot;When you add all of that together with the rest of our portfolio, ultimately what we want to do is use the next year or two to build our portfolio as wide and deep as we can,&quot; he says.</p>
			<p>&quot;The future is increasingly digital, but having a funnel of a really large linear audience lets you promote your plans for a digital future to many viewers. And that's really helpful.&quot;</p>
			<p>This also shouldn't be taken to mean that Discovery is taking its eye off the digital aspect of its business.</p>
			<p>Discovery is also investing in developing ThreeNow into a standalone service that's available across more devices and so that it offers a better user experience.</p>
			<p>&quot;There are three pillars to our plan with ThreeNow. The first one is distribution. We want it to appear on more end points than it does now. Secondly, we're investing in unique content, like Heartbreak Island, which will premiere on ThreeNow but not linear TV. And then we will also do a number of things to improve the digital experience for the viewer.&quot;</p>
			<p>The other major announcement to come from Kyne today involved his plans for Discovery's news offering Newshub.</p>
			<p>There have been a number of high-profile departures from this part of the business in recent months, including AM Show host Duncan Garner, political editor Tova O'Brien and dedicated business reporter Madison Reidy.</p>
			<p>Kyne said that despite these departures, Discovery still had a good rundown of talent available within the business.</p>
			<p>He said the company would also see the return of Samantha Hayes and Kanoa Lloyd from maternity leave shortly, which would serve as a boost.</p>
			<p>&quot;Our DNA hasn't changed,&quot; Kyne said, pointing out that there were various new opportunities for staff to step into.</p>
			<p>Discovery will be introducing Newshub Live at 8pm on Gusto, which will take the form of 30-minute bulletin focused on the big stories of the day.</p>
			<p>Earlier today, the company also announced that Melissa Chan-Green will join Ryan Bridge as co-host of the all-new AM.</p>
			<p>Included among the changes will be the AM Early show, dedicated local and international news, with a focus on business issues.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/11/09/amc-launches-in-australia/<br>
			</p>
			<p>AMC Networks has launched its streaming bundle AMC+ in Australia, allowing viewers to access a raft of shows from the US operator and its sibling streamers Acorn TV and Shudder.</p>
			<p>The service, which became available via YouTube in the US earlier this year, will allow Aussie subscribers to watch shows including revenge thriller The Beast Must Die, animated comedy Ultra City Smiths and Italian dystopian drama Anna, which AMC acquired in August.</p>
			<p>Australian vampire thriller Firebite is also available, alongside Acorn TV shows such as Midsomer Murders, Dalgliesh and Poirot, and Shudder series including Creepshow and Slasher: Flesh and Blood.</p>
			<p>AMC+ is available via Apple TV and Amazon&rsquo;s Prime Video Channels, costing $8.99 ($12) a month.</p>
			<p>Courtney Thomasma, GM at AMC+, said the bundle would offer Australian audiences &ldquo;thrilling, thought-provoking stories and iconic characters together through one subscription.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Last week, AMC upped original programming &amp; studio president Dan McDermott to an expanded role covering acquisitions across the company&rsquo;s services. The move followed news that AMC veterans Ed Carroll and Josh Sapan would be stepping down later this year.<br>

We are delighted to be partnering with Netflix to bring their great content slate through Astro as part of a one-stop entertainment centre. Simplicity has become a core pillar for us in recent times, driving us to transform the Astro experience into a holistic easy-to-use, go-to platform, making our customers&rsquo; entertainment seamless.

			<p>Tony Zameczkowski, Vice President for Business Development, APAC, Netflix, added: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled to bring an elevated multi-device entertainment experience to more Malaysians. At Netflix, our goal is to offer the best-in-class entertainment to our members, and we&rsquo;re thrilled that through this partnership with Astro, more Malaysians will be able to experience and enjoy our entire catalogue &#151; whether it be Hollywood blockbusters like Red Notice, Spanish series like Money Heist, Korean content the likes of Squid Game, which is a huge favourite among fans in Malaysia&rdquo;.</p>

Today, we hit another milestone by aggregating the Netflix app directly onto Ultra Box so that customers can stream Netflix content seamlessly for an unbeatable big screen experience at home.

Customers have the choice to remain on their current packs, but we know that many will want to upgrade to the exciting new packs to stream all the amazing content from our streaming partners and enjoy a big screen experience. Our new packs come with flexible contract terms of 0, 12 or 24 months to suit customers&rsquo; preferences.

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/11/08/viasat-to-acquire-inmarsat/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The long-expected consolidation amongst major satellite players is happening. California-based Viasat is set to buy London-based Inmarsat for $7.3 billion (&euro;6.3bn) in a cash and shares deal.</p>
			<p>Inmarsat was taken private in 2019 at $6 billion. Today, Viasat is paying an extra $1.3 billion as management have valued the Net Present Value of synergies at $1.5 billion. Inmarsat financials nor any deal valuation metrics have been disclosed at this stage.</p>
			<p>Viasat&rsquo;s management points to Inmarsat offering complementary resources that will help create a multi-band, multi-orbit system. As a result of the deal, Viasat&rsquo;s revenue profile will become more global, more diverse and more resilient. Viasat management claims the combined entity has potential for mid-teens percentage revenue growth.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The combination will create a leading global communications innovator with enhanced scale and scope to affordably, securely and reliably connect the world. The complementary assets and resources of the new organization will enable the availability of advanced new services in mobile and fixed segments, driving greater customer choice in broadband communications and narrowband services (including the Internet of Things),&rdquo; says Viasat.</p>
			<p>The new combination will circle the planet with 19 satellites with an additional 10 satellites on order.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is a transformative combination that advances our common ambitions to connect the world. The unique fusion of teams, technologies and resources provides the ingredients and scale needed for profitable growth through the creation and delivery of innovative broadband and IoT services in new and existing fast-growing segments and geographies,&rdquo; said Viasat&rsquo;s Executive Chairman Mark Dankberg. &ldquo;Inmarsat&rsquo;s dual-band global mobile network, unique L-band resources, skills and capabilities in the UK and excellent technical and operational talent worldwide, are powerful complements to Viasat&rsquo;s business. Together, we can advance broadband communications and create new hybrid space and terrestrial networks that drive greater performance, coverage, speed, reliability and value for customers. We look forward to welcoming the Inmarsat team into the Viasat family.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Investment bank Exane/BNPP states in a note to clients: &ldquo;Talking at the BNP Paribas Global Markets Conference last week, Elon Musk guided for Starlink to generate $30 billion of annual revenues in the medium to long term. Viasat derives 64 per cent of its EBITDA from providing Satellites Services into US consumer broadband markets as well as Inflight Connectivity and Oil &amp; Gas services. Faced with increased competitive pressure from Space X, SES or Telesat, Viasat is joining forces with Inmarsat to build scale, extract cost synergies and reinvest in a multi-orbit, multi-band satellite system with established distribution channels.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The bank adds: &ldquo;This merger underpins the idea that scale matters in the satellite industry and that consolidation could accelerate (as suggested by the Patrick Drahi&rsquo;s bid for Eutelsat). However, apart from adding scale (and leverage &#150; Viasat will be trading on 5x net debt to EBITDA) to one established incumbent competitor, we do not believe this Viasat/Inmarsat will change the competitive landscape for Eutelsat or SES significantly.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Neither Viasat nor Inmarsat operate in the Video segment. Inmarsat has no consumer broadband business (the growth engine of Eutelsat). Neither Viasat nor Inmarsat have assets in Mid Earth Orbit. It is however likely that the merged entity will invest in developing a Low Earth Orbit system for which both Viasat and Inmarsat already had spectrum rights,&rdquo; says Exane/BNPP.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Satellite constellation operator OneWeb has won distribution over Pakistan.</p>
			<p>An agreement between its OneWeb/NEOM joint-venture has been signed with REDtone Telecommunications, which is a licensed telcoand digital services provider.</p>
			<p>The newly formed OneWeb/NEOM Tech &amp; Digital JV will bring high-speed satellite connectivity to NEOM, Saudi Arabia, the wider Middle East and neighbouring countries including Pakistan.</p>
			<p>The OneWeb/NEOM Tech &amp; Digital JV has exclusive rights to distribute OneWeb services in these regions for seven years, and is expected to commence operations in 2023.</p>
			<p>The OneWeb/NEOM Tech &amp; Digital JV is looking to transform businesses and communities, stimulating enterprise across the region, with gateways and Points of Presence (POPs) in the Middle East providing security, speed and low latency data to sectors such as finance and retail, as well as schools and hospitals.</p>
			<p>The JV says it will offer a seamless solution to infrastructural hurdles in Pakistan, where mobile operators and local loop operators will be able to leverage the service to expand their coverage areas, offering dependable low-cost internet access.</p>
			<p>Matthew Johnson, Interim CEO of the OneWeb/NEOM Tech &amp; Digital JV, said: &ldquo;LEO satellites not only mean we can reach absolutely everyone everywhere, but with reliable and rapid speeds &#150; connectivity at 100 megabits per second and more without the need for techniques such as trenching or placement of 5G equipment and fiber optics. This partnership with REDtone highlights how this technology presents an incredible growth opportunity for the wider region.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Laith Hamad, Director, OneWeb/NEOM Tech &amp; Digital JV, said: &ldquo;We are delighted to partner with REDtone to bring affordable connectivity to the widest possible audience in Pakistan, especially for so many who do not yet have high-speed internet. This is the first agreement signed by the joint venture, which was formed just last month. We look forward to more such partnerships in the region.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>REDtone Group Chairman, Nadeem Yunus, said: &ldquo;With the growth in digitisation across the world, connectivity has truly become a necessity and a basic right in this day and age. Our partnership with the OneWeb/NEOM Tech &amp; Digital JV is a step in that direction: through their innovative Low Earth Orbit communications network, together we will optimise sharing of information, enable massive economic growth and learning across terrains, where conventional networks fail.&rdquo;<br>

			</p>
			<p>Amazon.com is seeking approval from US communications regulators to deploy more than 4,500 additional satellites as part of the company's effort to deliver broadband internet to areas around the world that lack high-speed service.</p>
			<p>Amazon had previously said it planned to spend at least US$10 billion to build 3,236 such satellites through its Project Kuiper program. Late on Thursday, it asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for approval to deploy a total of 7,774 satellites for the project.</p>
			<p>On Monday, Amazon asked the FCC for approval to launch and operate two prototype satellites by the end of 2022.</p>
			<p>Amazon said in its filing the satellites &quot;will serve households, hospitals, businesses, government agencies, and other organisations around the world, including in geographic areas where reliable broadband remains lacking.&quot;</p>
			<p>&quot;Although connectivity has improved on a global basis, only 51 percent of the global population, and 44 percent of the population of developing countries, are online,&quot; the company filing said.</p>
			<p>In 2020, the FCC approved the Project Kuiper plan for the constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites to compete with the Starlink network being built out by Elon Musk&rsquo;s SpaceX.</p>
			<p>Amazon has sparred with Musk, recently accusing the billionaire of ignoring a variety of government-imposed rules.</p>
			<p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Musk are rivals in the private space launch business. Bezos' Blue Origin had challenged the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's decision to award a US$2.9 billion lunar lander contract to SpaceX but a judge rejected the challenge on Thursday.</p>
			<p>SpaceX has deployed more than 1,700 satellites.</p>
			<p>Earlier this week, the FCC approved Boeing Co's application to launch and operate 147 satellites to provide high-speed broadband internet access.</p>
			<p>Boeing first filed with the FCC in 2017 seeking approval to deploy a V-band Constellation of mostly low-Earth orbit satellites.</p>
			<p>Boeing said this week it &quot;sees a multi-orbit future for satellite technologies. As the demand for satellite communications grows, diversity will be required across orbital regimes and frequencies to satisfy unique customer demands.&quot;<br>

			<p>News Corporation boss Robert Thomson has signalled the Rupert Murdoch-controlled media giant is edging closer to a float of its pay TV business Foxtel, attributing a rise in first quarter profits to the pay TV company and Dow Jones.</p>
			<p>The Rupert Murdoch-controlled media company said its subscription services segment - which includes Foxtel - reported a 46 per cent increase in earnings [before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation] for the first quarter, due to a $US24 million ($32.4 million) reduction in sports programming and production costs. Foxtel&rsquo;s streaming products Kayo Sports and Binge now have about 2.1 million paid subscribers.<br>
				News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson says the company is undergoing a review of Foxtel.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are primed to capitalise on the patent success of the Foxtel streaming strategy, which was highlighted during the Foxtel Strategy Day, and are reviewing potential permutations to maximise shareholder value and growth,&rdquo; Mr Thomson said.</p>
			<p>As of September 30, Foxtel&rsquo;s total closing paid subscribers were around 3.9 million. About 1.8 million were residential and commercial broadcast subscribers, while 2.1 million consisted of Kayo, Binge and Foxtel Now) subscribers.</p>
			<p>Foxtel Group&rsquo;s streaming revenues make up 19 per cent of total subscription revenues in the quarter, which increased $US14 million due to currency foreign fluctuations. Adjusted revenue was flat year-on-year.</p>
			<p>Foxtel brings in big gun as it weighs float</p>
			<p>News Corp revenue grew 18 per cent to $US2.5 billion ($3.4 billion) in the first quarter, while net income grew from $US47 million to $US267 million. EBITDA was $US410 million, up from $US268 million the year prior, driven by higher revenues, lower costs at Foxtel and a $US11 million positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations.</p>
			<p>The growth was also helped by Dow Jones, which grew revenue and profit to its highest point since it was acquired by News Corp.<br>

			<p>Foxtel&rsquo;s streaming products reached about 2.1 million paid subscribers in the September quarter, according to News Corp's first quarter results.</p>
			<p>This is a 69% rise in subscribers compared to the same three months last year.</p>
			<p>News Corp, majority owner of Foxtel, reported Subscription Video Services EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation) growing 46% to US$114 million.</p>
			<p>Revenue was up 3% to US$510 million.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Higher revenues from Kayo and BINGE and higher advertising revenues were offset by the impact from fewer residential broadcast subscribers and the negative impact from lower commercial subscription revenues primarily resulting from recent lockdowns related to the global COVID-19 pandemic,&quot; says News.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Foxtel Group streaming subscription revenues represented approximately 19% of total circulation and subscription revenues in the quarter. Adjusted Revenues were flat compared to the prior year.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>As of September 30, Foxtel&rsquo;s total paid subscribers were around 3.9 million, up 17% compared to the prior year. About 1.8 million of the total paid subscribers were residential and commercial broadcast subscribers.</p>
			<p>There were around 1.1 million Kayo subscribers (total and paying), compared to 681,000 subscribers, 644,000 paying, in the prior year.</p>
			<p>Binge had 885,000 subscribers, 802,000 paying, as of September 30 compared to 321,000, 290,000 paying.</p>

			<p>Broadcast subscriber churn in the quarter improved to 14% from 14.6%.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Segment EBITDA in the quarter increased $36 million, or 46%, compared with the prior year,&rdquo; News says.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The improvement was primarily driven by $34 million of lower sports programming rights and production costs, which reflects the $36 million negative impact seen in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 from the recognition of sports programming rights and production costs deferred from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The Segment EBITDA improvement was also due to a $3 million positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted Segment EBITDA increased 42%.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Boeing on Wednesday gained US authorization for a project to launch satellites that will provide internet services from space. </p>
			<p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said in a statement it had approved a license for the aerospace giant &quot;to construct, deploy, and operate a satellite constellation&quot; that will &quot;provide broadband and communications services for residential, commercial, institutional, governmental, and professional users in the United States and globally.&quot;</p>
			<p>&quot;Advanced satellite broadband services have an important role to play in connecting hard-to-serve communities,&quot; said Jessica Rosenworcel, the FCC chairwoman. </p>
			<p>The FCC gave the green light for 147 satellites, the vast majority of which will be in low orbit: 132 could be placed at an altitude of about 600 miles (1,000 km), and 15 would be much higher, between about 17,000 and 27,000 miles.</p>
			<p>The service will first be available to clients in the United States and then around the world.</p>
			<p>&quot;Boeing sees a multi-orbit future for satellite technologies,&quot; the aerospace company said in a statement.</p>
			<p>&quot;As the demand for satellite communications grows, diversity will be required across orbital regimes and frequencies to satisfy unique customer demands, and we see V-band as helping to provide some of that diversity,&quot; Boeing added.</p>
			<p>Other satellite constellation projects are already being rolled out by competing companies. </p>

			<p>China on Friday successfully launched a Guangmu Earth-science satellite via a Long March-6 carrier rocket from Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center. Guangmu is the world's first Earth-science satellite dedicated to serving the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda upon the 50th anniversary of the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the UN. </p>
			<p>Developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the satellite will carry out precision analysis of energy consumption, habitat patterns and coastal areas in the vicinity of human populations, and provide data for sustainable development indicators. </p>
			<p>Friday's launch, the 395th flight of the Long March rocket series, marks a perfect conclusion for the Long March-6 carrier rocket's four missions this year, the Global Times learned from the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology, developer of the rocket and a subsidiary of the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. </p>
			<p>The launch vehicle is the country's new-generation, non-polluting liquid-fueled rocket, capable of performing a variety of orbital launch missions that can support multi-satellite launches, satellite constellation and complementary satellite network missions.</p>
			<p>It can carry a payload of up to one ton to the 700-kilometer Sun-synchronous orbit, the Global Times learned on Friday. </p>
			<p>Since its debut in 2015, Long March-6 has undergone a variety of technical upgrades which have enabled the vehicle to maintain its heavy workload. </p>
			<p>Compared with the first generation of Long March-6 rockets, the second group used in Friday launch has been subject to significant changes to its electrical system, making it more durable, increasing its total capacity and making it simpler to operate. <br>

			<p>Intelsat and OneWeb government subsidiary OneWeb Technologies used both Geostationary Orbit (GEO) and Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites simultaneously, and software switched the data flow between orbits at the packet level depending on the connection needed for the application. Various terminals were used during the test including a SatCube terminal, a Kymeta U7/8 terminal, a Litecom GEO terminal, and a OneWeb Intellian terminal. The test demonstrated applications such as two-way voice and data downloads and video.</p>
			<p>This was a strategic demonstration to the U.S. DoD to demonstrate transport diversification between GEO and LEO constellations with seamless switching between them. The military refers to it as Automated Primary, Alternate, Contingency, and Emergency (APACE) communications. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;This demonstration shows how through the power of partnership, we can provide a reliable, secure, multi-orbit, multi-band capability for the military that connects our warfighters to meet their evolving mission requirements,&rdquo; said President of Intelsat General, Dave Micha. </p>
			<p>OneWeb reported a similar GEO/LEO demonstration with Hughes Network Systems in September.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/11/04/roku-to-close-adult-entertainment-loophole/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Roku has confirmed that it is closing a loophole that has allowed non-certified apps &#150; including apps from adult content providers &#150; to operate on its platform.</p>
			<p>Earlier this week, the company announced that it is launching an independent developer kit (IDK) that will allow developers to &ldquo;extend the utility of the Roku OS and facilitate even more innovation across the platform.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>In that announcement, Roku confirmed that it will remove non-certified channels from its platform by March 2022 and it has since emerged that this will see adult entertainment apps impacted by the change.</p>
			<p>So-called &lsquo;non-certified channels&rsquo; are not available in the Roku channel store as the company says they are largely used for testing channels ahead of their official launch. Such apps however have been available via a Private Channels feature where users can access apps with a direct link or code.</p>
			<p>However, this feature is being removed as Roku says that the IDK makes non-certified channels &ldquo;no longer necessary.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The change is not as simple as it would be on a platform like Android TV, which allows users to sideload apps with relative ease. Roku users can sideload apps, but it is restricted to one at a time. <br>

			<p><b><i>Australia: 19.4m SVoD subs <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/11/03/australia-19-4m-svod-subs/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Australians streamed 20 billion minutes of premium online video in January-September 2021, according to a report from Media Partners Asia (MPA) measuring the Australian streaming economy.</p>
			<p>SVoD platforms drove 70 per cent of premium video streaming, while BVoDs took 30 per cent. The report, titled Australia Online Video Consumer Insights &amp; Analytics, leverages MPA&rsquo;s proprietary AMPD Research Platform to measure and analyse streaming media consumption across key VoD services on iOS and Android mobile and PC devices.</p>
			<p>The report indicates that SVoD subscriptions reached 19.4 million at end-September 2021. Netflix retains its #1 position with 33 per cent share of subs and a strong lead in consumption share. Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ compete for second place with 15 per cent share of subscribers each. Disney+ outperforms Amazon in consumption share, benefiting from the introduction of Star general entertainment content this year.</p>
			<p>MPA Executive Director, Vivek Couto, said: &ldquo;Australia&rsquo;s subscription streaming market is maturing at 60 per cent household penetration. New entrants will need to win market share from incumbents and consider freemium models with strong local partnerships. The importance of sports continues to grow with four major players led by Foxtel&rsquo;s Kayo competing for subscribers and audience loyalty. The overall sports segment accounted for almost 15 per cent of the total SVoD customer base at end-September 2021&rdquo;</p>
			<p>SHARE OF SVOD SUBSCRIBERS </p>
			<p>Australia had 19.4 million SVoD subscriptions at end-Q3 2021, representing 60 per cent household penetration based on an average number of 3.5 SVoD services subscribed per household. The market is maturing.</p>
			<p>Netflix commands a third of all SVoD subscriptions and 38 per cent of SVoD consumption. A deep library of US original and acquired English language comedy and drama series is a key draw for Australians.</p>
			<p>Disney+ captures 15 per cent of SVoD subs and 16 per cent of SVoD category consumption. The launch of the Star tile in February has boosted Disney&rsquo;s consumer proposition with the introduction of GE series and movies from Fox, ABC and others.</p>
			<p>Amazon Prime Video is growing rapidly with 15 per cent share of the SVoD base though under-indexing on consumption. Subscriptions are linked to Amazon&rsquo;s free shipping service. Prime&rsquo;s library of acquired US and UK dramas, procedural series and movies drive consumption.</p>
			<p>Nine Entertainment&rsquo;s local GE &amp; sports SVoD service Stan has 13 per cent of SVoD subs and 18 per cent of category consumption. Stan maintains important output deals with ViacomCBS and NBCU while original content is a key differentiator. Stan Sport has exclusive rights to the Champions League and Rugby Championship. ~15 per cent of Stan subs have taken up Stan Sport, which is offered as a A$10 add-on.</p>
			<p>Foxtel&rsquo;s OTT services (Kayo, Binge and Foxtel Now) have grown rapidly for a 11 per cent SVoD subs share. Kayo&rsquo;s SVOD base reached 1.2 mil. at end-Sept and the platform is Australia&rsquo;s largest sports SVoD platform with streaming rights to ~50 sports and 13 live channels. Prominent rights include the NRL and AFL. Binge has output deals with NBCU and HBO. HBO titles are a key draw. Kayo and Binge capture 9 per cent of SVoD streaming minutes.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From Press Release: Kacific<br>
			</p>
			<p>Industry&rsquo;s most powerful return technology offers satellite operator unrivaled service agility and scale to serve multiple markets and applications</p>
			<p>ST Engineering iDirect, a global leader in satellite communications, announced today that Kacific, a leading satellite broadband operator in Asia Pacific, has successfully deployed its pioneering Mx-DMA&reg; MRC (Multi Resolution Coding) technology in conjunction with its first Ka-band satellite, Kacific1, to provide high-speed, low-cost, ultra-reliable broadband to rural and suburban areas of the Pacific and Southeast Asia.</p>
			<p>Mx-DMA MRC is a patented multi-access waveform that incorporates the scalability of MF-TDMA with the efficiency of single channel per carrier (SCPC) into a single return technology for unprecedented service agility. It enables service providers to cover a myriad of use cases in a single return link without making tradeoffs between speed, efficiency and scale lowering their total cost of ownership.</p>
			<p>Kacific operates over 8,000 terminals, including the new cost-effective MDM2010 modems in Mx-DMA MRC mode, spread across 56 beams. The technology will allow access to an abundance of use cases across multiple markets, including underserved communities, businesses, and public institutions as well as 3G and 4G cellular backhaul services across the Asia-Pacific region. This allows Kacific to use a single return technology for the majority of its customers&rsquo; use cases, and quickly expand to more customers in underserved areas due to better efficiency, scale and operational simplicity.</p>
			<p>Mx-DMA MRC enables Kacific to scale its services while simplifying operations by optimizing the network bandwidth in real-time, utilizing self-organizing frequency plans that largely simplify network planning and eliminate the need for upfront traffic characterization or pre-configurations. As Mx-DMA MRC scales in MHz, it is independent of the number of terminals used in the network. Kacific can now offer the highest level of intelligent, real-time bandwidth allocation at SCPC efficiencies while maximizing the utilization of available bandwidth resources and delivering the best Quality of Experience (QoE). The new protocol fuels Kacific&rsquo;s capabilities, driving connectivity in regions and making it the largest regional Ka-band broadband network.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We first introduced Mx-DMA back in 2014 as a response to the MF-TDMA versus SCPC dilemma that many of our customers face. Mx-DMA MRC builds on that legacy and takes it to another level,&rdquo; said Bart Van Poucke, Vice President of Products at ST Engineering iDirect. &ldquo;We are proud that Kacific has become one of the early adopters of this technology. This will enable them to unlock tremendous flexibility and scale, open up opportunities and allow them to deliver a broader range of service levels at a lower cost structure without compromise. We are constantly committed to bringing innovation like this to the market, delivering industry-leading technology that protects our customers&rsquo; investments well into the future.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The efficiency of the MRC technology allows Kacific to deliver affordable price points and return speeds on small consumer-type VSAT terminals at a magnitude better than any other system,&rdquo; said Cyril Annarella, Chief Operating Officer at Kacific Broadband Satellites Group. &ldquo;Whether in suburban, rural, or fringe and remote areas, we help businesses, governments and communities fully participate in the digital world.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>A Long March-2C carrier rocket carrying two new remote-sensing satellites blasts off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China, November 3, 2021. /China Media Group</p>
			<p>China successfully launched two new remote-sensing satellites from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China at 3:43 p.m. on Wednesday.</p>
			<p>The satellites, members of the Yaogan-32 family, will be used for electromagnetic environment surveys and other technology tests.</p>
			<p>They were sent into orbit by a Long March-2C carrier rocket with an attached upper stage named Expedition-1S. Upper stages are independent spacecraft installed on a carrier rocket that are capable of restarting their engines multiple times in space to allow them to send different payloads into different orbits. Therefore, they are also referred to as space shuttles.</p>
			<p>The launch was the third mission of Expedition-1S. Its first flight with a Long March-2C carrier rocket was in October 2018, when the pair sent the first group of satellites of the Yaogan-32 family into orbit. Then on August 24, 2021, the pair launched three communication technology test satellites into space.</p>

			</p>
			<p>Oman&rsquo;s first satellite will be launched into Earth&rsquo;s lower orbit by the end of 2022.</p>
			<p>The CubeSat technology-based satellite is the result of a collaboration between Oman&rsquo;s TUATARA, a business solutions provider, ETCO, an international emerging technology company, and Poland&rsquo;s SatRevolution a satellite manufacturer and space service company. All three are working with Oman&rsquo;s Ministry of Transport, Communications and Information Technology (MTCIT).</p>
			<p>The agreement between the organisations was signed at the International Astronautical Congress, which was held from 25 to 29 October in Dubai.</p>
			<p>According to the Times of Oman, besides the launch of the satellite itself, a five-year collaboration between the parties will include designing and manufacturing a complete satellite imaging receiving and transmission infrastructure based on CubeSat technology.</p>
			<p>The project will be executed in stages comprising several crucial elements of the design, manufacture and development of software, enabling ETCO to operate the CubeSat. These include the creation of the ground station by TUATARA and SatRevolution, providing connection, operations and datalink with the launched CubeSat, along with personnel training and know-how transfer.</p>
			<p>The project will be technologically independent, collecting and processing useful data. The partners say that satellite images can be used to monitor agriculture, renewable energy, oil, mining, weather forecasting, border monitoring and national security within the Sultanate.</p>
			<p>Downstream analysis of images and data acquired from satellites using computer vision, machine learning and artificial intelligence technology will enable recognition of patterns and trends, enabling the prediction of the impact of climate change or natural disasters, among other phenomena.<br>

			</p>
			<p>BT hopes satellites can help deliver digital services across the UK by 2028</p>
			<p>BT has announced a first partnership with satellite provider OneWeb, potentially signalling the start of a new era for connectivity for the company.</p>
			<p>The deal will see BT examine how Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication services provided by OneWeb could boost BT networks and connectivity to users around the world.</p>
			<p>BT and OneWeb signed an initial Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in July, with this new official agreement signalling the next step forward in the partnership, which aims to use LEOs to deliver digital services anywhere across the UK by 2028.</p>
			<p>BT OneWeb satellites</p>
			<p>The partnership means that, following initial trials concerning how OneWeb satellites integrate with its networks, BT will start the first live trials with customers from early 2022. </p>
			<p>The company's EE mobile arm had hinted at possible satellite coverage earlier this year, but BT did not mention mobile in its press release, instead noting the initial launch could focus on IoT backhaul and Fixed Wireless Access in rural areas.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Space is an emerging and enormous digital opportunity, and this is an important step towards harnessing its potential for BT&rsquo;s customers across the globe,&quot; said Philip Jansen, Chief Executive of BT Group.</p>
			<p>&quot;We will put OneWeb&rsquo;s technology through its paces in our UK  labs with the goal of delivering live trials in early 2022. Delivered securely and at scale, satellite solutions will be an important part of our plans to expand connectivity throughout the UK and globally, and to further diversify the range of services we can offer our customers.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>OneWeb says it hopes to deliver global coverage by June 2022 through its network of 648 LEOs, including complete coverage of the UK later this year. </p>
			<p>The company notes that current capacity levels within its satellites will mean initial trials focus on its role as a supplementary, low latency backhaul solution to sites where additional capacity or a back-up solution is required, and to deliver improved resilience for business customers.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;BT has taken the lead in the  recognition of LEO satellite&rsquo;s advantage,&quot; said OneWeb&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer Neil Masterson. </p>
			<p>&quot;We are delighted as this agreement with BT Group represents an important strategic partnership for OneWeb as we continue to make progress  towards our operational launch. We are excited to be playing such a key role in improving  the resilience of the overall telecom infrastructure in the UK. OneWeb&rsquo;s connectivity  platform will help bridge the last digital divides across the country and enhance the nation&rsquo;s  digital infrastructure.&rdquo;  <br>

			</p>
			<p>ABS, a global satellite operator, and TAP Digital Media Ventures Corporation (TAPDMV) have signed a multi-channel, multi-year term contract on ABS-2.</p>
			<p>The distribution capacity agreement is on the ABS-2 East Hemi beam to deliver TAPDMV channels across the Philippines and other communities.</p>
			<p>Under this long-term contract, TAPDMV will leverage the ABS-2 premier video neighborhood at 75&deg;East to broadcast their four HD channels: TAP Action Flix, Tap Sports, Tap Movies, Premier Sports and two SD channels: Tap TV and Tap Edge. TAPDMV is a multi-platform media company offering TV and digital over the top media services and owns a portfolio of eight TV channels and programming rights with many international broadcasters.</p>

We are excited to broadcast TAPDMV&rsquo;s major channels to the Philippines enabling them to grow their business by providing viewers with high-quality programming and compelling entertainment services,&rdquo; said Jennifer Blasko, ABS EVP of Sales and Marketing. &ldquo;TAPDMV expansion in the linear broadcast market shows the resiliency of satellite distribution in the Philippines where the majority of subscribers are still viewing their favorite channels through their DTH and cable subscriptions.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>&ldquo;TAPDMV has placed its full confidence in the satellite distribution capabilities of ABS-2 to deliver the live linear feeds of the company&rsquo;s premium sports properties which include UFC, Formula One, EPL, WTA Tour, NFL, as well as our entertainment channels bundle, to our cable and DTH affiliates nationwide,&rdquo; said Celinda De Guia, President and CEO of TAP Digital Media Ventures Corporation.<br>

				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Amazon_to_launch_two_Project_Kuiper_satellites_next_fall_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>The first set of satellites Amazon plans to send to space along with Verizon will be launched next fall, according to an experimental launch license filed Monday.</p>
			<p>The company plans to send up to 3,236 satellites as part of Project Kuiper, a satellite-internet service that will serve rural communities that lack terrestrial infrastructure.</p>
			<p>Two satellites -- called KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2 -- are prototypes that will be launched by United Launch Alliance on rockets from ABL Space Systems. They will house and test the technology needed for the entire project, including antennas, modems, and power and propulsion.</p>
			<p>The Federal Communications Commission gave Amazon a deadline to launch half of all its satellites by 2026.</p>
			<p>Project Kuiper is the second pursuit in space for Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who also owns Blue Origin, which last week announced plans with Sierra Nevada Corp. for a private space station called Orbital Reef.</p>
			<p>The venture will rival Starlink, SpaceX owner Elon Musk's satellite-based broadband service, and others aiming to provide high-speed Internet to customers from low Earth orbit.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.nzherald.co.nz/hawkes-bay-today/news/rocket-lab-launch-helicopter-prepares-for-reusable-rocket-catching-off-mahia-coast/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab's next launch from Mahia in just over a week will involve a reusable rocket.</p>
			<p>The United States-based space company says the next mission would be its third ocean recovery mission, bringing Electron's first stage back to Earth under a parachute before a soft landing in the ocean where a team of engineers will be stationed to retrieve it, haul it onboard their vessel, and bring it back to Rocket Lab's production complex for inspection.</p>
			<p>For the first time a helicopter will be involved in the operations offshore and will simulate catching a returning rocket in preparation for future mid-air recovery missions.</p>
			<p>The mission &#151; called Love At First Insight &#151; is scheduled to lift off from Launch Complex 1 in Mahia during a 14-day launch window that opens on November 11.</p>
			<p>The mission's primary objective is to deploy two Earth-observation satellites for global monitoring company BlackSky, with the secondary objective to splash down and recover Electron's first stage to further validate Rocket Lab's recovery operations and hardware.</p>
			<p>&quot;We've perfected Electron's controlled descent, demonstrated flawless parachute deployment and successfully plucked stages from the ocean,&quot; Rocket Lab chief executive Peter Beck said.</p>
			<p>&quot;Now we're gearing up for the next stage &#151; preparing to use a helicopter to catch a rocket as it descends to Earth from space.</p>
			<p>&quot;It's ambitious but with each recovery mission we've iterated and refined the hardware and processes to make the impossible ordinary.</p>
			<p>&quot;I'm excited to take what we learn from this launch and put it into practice with aerial capture missions in future.&quot;</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab will be tracking the stage's descent from space and as it approaches 19,000 feet (5.7 kilometres) from the ocean surface, a helicopter will be dispatched to conduct reconnaissance of the returning booster.</p>
			<p>The Love At First Insight mission will also feature new recovery hardware developments to Electron, including an advanced parachute to be deployed from the first stage at a higher altitude, allowing for a slower drift back to Earth to test communications and tracking for future aerial recovery.</p>
			<p>Electron also features improvements to the first stage heat shield which protects its nine Rutherford engines while they endure up to 2200-degree heat and incredible pressure on the descent back to Earth.<br>

			<p><b><i>Foxtel Shifts Broadcast Focus To Cricket<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://ministryofsport.com.au/exclusive-foxtel-shifts-broadcast-focus-to-cricket/<br>
			</p>
			<p>In an interview with Ministry of Sport, Foxtel commercial director &#150; sport, Rebecca McCloy, discussed the broadcaster&rsquo;s shift in focus from winter sports to summer sports.</p>
			<p>McCloy recently spoke at the Ministry of Sport Women in Sport Summit 2021 at USC Stadium on the Sunshine Coast, delivering a key discussion on Foxtel&rsquo;s approach to women&rsquo;s sport and the organisation&rsquo;s strategic direction.</p>
			<p>On the focus of broadcast growth with cricket for the upcoming season, which is already underway with the T20 World Cup, McCloy said: &ldquo;We are currently in a transition period from winter codes to summer.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Cricket is off to an early start with the T20 World Cup exclusively which is generating strong engagement across both our linear and streaming platforms.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;After the first 15 matches we&rsquo;ve seen a 200% growth in viewers, compared to the corresponding stage of the previous tournament in 2016.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This early start to our summer of cricket is the perfect precursor to the highly-anticipated Ashes series just around the corner in December.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing bigger in summer than the Ashes and our viewers have the ability to really immerse themselves in the action as part of our 4K UHD offering on Foxtel.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this premium experience along with our expert commentary teams and dedicated magazine shows that give us a point of difference and keep audiences engaged &#150; Fox Cricket alone is expected to broadcast more than 1,300 hours of live matches across all formats which shows the breadth of our coverage,&rdquo; McCloy told Ministry of Sport.</p>
			<p>Reflecting back on the impacts of COVID-19 on the cancellation of international sport and how Foxtel has managed commercial operations as a result, McCloy said the flexibility of Foxtel and the evolution of digital in the organisation has helped them accelerate.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;For over 18 months we have woken up every morning with a change to a sporting event somewhere in the world, but the team at Fox Sports haven&rsquo;t missed a beat,&rdquo; McCloy said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve done an incredible job of changing schedules, delivery paths and production and promotional plans at the last minute.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In Australia, the key to successfully navigating this disruption is the level of collaboration and cooperation we have with our partners.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt the past two years have been challenging due to the impacts of COVID but the adaptability of our business, products and partnerships has really accelerated as well.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Kayo in particular has continued to evolve and innovate at a rapid pace.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In the last 12 months Kayo has entered an agreement with Telstra to replace the AFL and NRL Live Pass, launched Kayo Freebies and built a bespoke Pay-Per-View platform to allow people to purchase Main Event UFC and Boxing fights through their account,&rdquo; she said.</p>
			<p>When asked about the innovations on the way from Foxtel over the course of the summer of sport, McCloy said: &ldquo;In addition to our 4K UHD coverage of the Ashes, we will see the return of the Flying Fox camera, along with additional camera angles for KFC BBL (Big Bash League) Finals.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Building on the success of the first Kayo Original, Below the Bonnet, there will also be more original content coming to Kayo this summer along the introduction of Kayo Bites &#150; five-minute highlights packages for people who want to catch up games quickly.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We will also continue to enhance Kayo&rsquo;s globally recognised user experience, which offers users innovative features such as SplitView, Key Moments, Kayo Minis and No Spoilers,&rdquo; she told Ministry of Sport.<br>

			<p><b><i>Lack of contenders stymies auction of satellite orbital slots<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2207283/satellite-bid-in-limbo<br>
			</p>
			<p>The country's first auction for the right to use satellite orbital slots, which was scrapped in August, appears to be going nowhere in the near future as long as SET-listed Thaicom is still the sole prospective contender in the eyes of the authorities.</p>
			<p>On Aug 18, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) board decided to scrap the auction scheduled to take place on Aug 28 after Thaicom through its wholly owned firm, TC Space Connect, was the only contender of the event.</p>
			<p>The regulator indicated that participation of only one contender in the auction cannot create fair competition.</p>
			<p>With only one contender in the auction, authorities were believed to be uneasy about holding the event to allocate the orbital slots, although Thaicom is keen to participate as its 30-year satellite operating concession expired in September.</p>
			<p>In fact, the Aug 28 auction was already postponed from the original schedule on July 24, as the NBTC wanted to give more time for interested parties to join in after TC Space Connect was the sole contender in the auction.</p>
			<p>Thaicom, formerly known as Shin Satellite Plc, was founded by former premier Thaksin Shinawatra in 1991. It was the first company to provide commercial satellite services in the country under a concession granted by the Transport Ministry at that time.</p>
			<p>SOLE BIDDER</p>
			<p>A source at the NBTC board who requested anonymity told the Bangkok Post that Thaicom may be a cause for concern among state agencies as it was founded by Thaksin.</p>
			<p>&quot;As long as Thaicom is seen as the only prospective bidder in the auction, it is hard to move ahead to establish the new auction timeline,&quot; the source said.</p>
			<p>The government also had a plan in mind to allocate some orbital slots to National Telecom (NT) so it can leverage them for public benefits, but NT is not willing to deal with the matter, the source said.</p>
			<p>Regarding the auction, four satellite orbital slot packages were put up for bidding.</p>
			<p>The first package consisted of 50.5&deg;East and 51&deg;E orbital slots with a reserve price of 677 million baht; the second was 78.5&deg;E with a reserve price of 366.4 million; the third was 119.5&deg;E and 120&deg;E at 393 million; and the last was for 126&deg;E and 142&deg;E with a reserve price of 364.6 million.</p>
			<p>The original auction conditions indicated that even if there is only one bidder in the auction, the auction can be carried out.</p>
			<p>But on Aug 18, the NBTC board passed a resolution in the morning to amend this condition by stipulating that the auction cannot happen if there is only one bidder participating. And in the afternoon, it resolved to cancel the auction.</p>
			<p>The board also assigned the NBTC management to adjust the principle and methods of the auction to find better conditions to attract more bidders.</p>
			<p>The source said the Aug 18 resolutions came as a surprise because beforehand the NBTC chairman made it clear that the auction timeline must be adhered to despite having only one bidder.</p>
			<p>The NBTC also holds full authority to conduct the auction in compliance with Section 27 of the amended NBTC Act. The amended NBTC law marks the NBTC as the sole agency governing all related satellite businesses in the country, including a role to arrange orbital slot space with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a United Nations specialised agency for information and communication technologies.</p>
			<p>&quot;Although the NBTC management has to adjust the auction conditions in line with the board's assignment, it still has no idea about the timeline of the auction,&quot; the source said.</p>
			<p>Digital Economy and Society (DES) Minister Chaiwut Thanakamanusorn pointed out that the auction should be held after the new NBTC board is formed. The selection process of the new board members is now underway.</p>
			<p>The existing board of six remaining commissioners is working under a special extension term granted by the previous military regime, as the board's working term ended in October 2017.</p>
			<p>&quot;Basically, governments of any countries may have a policy of keeping some satellite orbital slots for particular purposes and some slots can be reallocated or auctioned off,&quot; said Mr Chaiwut.</p>
			<p>RISK AHEAD</p>
			<p>According to the NBTC source, some orbital slots subject to the auction are now at risk of being taken back by the ITU from Thailand which has not yet deployed satellites to use the slots in the ITU's seven-year coordination timeframe, which ends in early 2022.</p>
			<p>&quot;Although these slots are not seen as commercially attractive for satellite business, the loss of orbital slots would make it more difficult for the NBTC to seek the new filing or it may have to queue up for long to get them in the future,&quot; the source said.</p>
			<p>Technically, one orbital slot could cater to several satellites but good cooperation is needed between satellite operators to ward off disruptive incidents.</p>
			<p>Based on the ITU rule, any countries that are granted the right to use any orbital slots need to cooperate with others in adjacent slots to ward off signal intervention, according to the source.<br>

			</p>
			<p>&quot;Tens of thousands of small satellites will be launched over the next decade, and Terran Orbital is ideally positioned to meet this demand, offering the most innovative, cost-effective small satellites that can meet the data demands for governments and corporations. Similarly, Terran Orbital's own earth observation constellation will make the most technologically advanced data about our planet commercially available, which will unlock new markets for data and insights across industries.&quot;  </p>
			<p>Tailwind Two Acquisition Corp and Terran Orbital Corporation have entered into a definitive business combination agreement. Upon the closing of the transaction, the combined company will operate as Terran Orbital Corporation, with plans to list on the NYSE under the symbol LLAP. The pro forma total enterprise value of the combined companies is approximately $1.58 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.</p>
			<p>The transaction is supported by gross proceeds of $345 million from Tailwind Two's cash-in-trust, $50 million from a PIPE with participation from AE Industrial Partners, long-term Terran Orbital investor Beach Point Capital, Daniel Staton[1], Lockheed Martin and Fuel Venture Capital, as well as $75 million of additional financial commitments from Francisco Partners and Beach Point Capital.</p>
			<p>In connection with the closing of the transaction, up to an additional $125 million in debt commitments from Francisco Partners and Lockheed Martin may be available subject to certain conditions. Existing Terran Orbital shareholders will roll 100% of their equity into the combined company.</p>
			<p>Terran Orbital is the pioneer and innovator of small satellites, with fully integrated operations, scale manufacturing and mission management capabilities. The company is the leading provider of small satellite solutions for military, intelligence community, civil and commercial customers. In addition, Terran Orbital is capitalizing on its fully integrated manufacturing capabilities to launch one of the most advanced earth observation constellation of small satellites, which will provide highly persistent, real-time earth imagery as a service, making earth observation data more abundant and accessible than ever before.</p>
			<p>On September 27th, Terran Orbital announced plans to develop a $300 million, 660,000 sq.ft. space manufacturing facility on the Space Coast of Florida. Upon completion, the newly constructed facility is expected to become one of the most advanced, largest vertically integrated satellite manufacturing facilities in the world, capable of producing over 1,000 satellites and space vehicles annually.</p>
			<p>&quot;Terran Orbital is the largest independently-owned manufacturer of small satellites in the United States, serving national interests and enabling our customers to leverage the strength of our platform and insights. With our high volume, innovative manufacturing of small satellites, we will be able to deliver emerging technologies to space faster, more affordably and with greater reliability than anyone.

			<p>&quot;In addition, our industry-leading earth observation constellation will deliver images of any geography on earth, at any time of day or night, within minutes. This capability will unlock a high-growth, high-margin data-as-a-service business model that will be truly transformational for Terran Orbital, its customers and investors.&quot;</p>

			<p><b><i>Australia on track to have dedicated military satellites<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.theaustralian.com.au/special-reports/australia-on-track-to-have-dedicated-military-satellites/news-story/0497bd562402eb22734d80e7e2313adc<br>
			</p>
			<p>A key ingredient for strategic self-reliance is a sovereign communications capability &#150; and Australia has been lacking in that regard for some time, with a high level of dependence on US and commercial satellites for global reach.</p>
			<p>Defence has a payload on the Optus C-1 satellite that went into orbit in 2003, but that has limited remaining life as well as restricted geographical coverage, so the race is on to have a capability available from later this decade.</p>
			<p>Known as JP 9102, the tender &#150; which closes in January, slightly later than planned &#150; has taken a conservative approach and the specification is oriented to a large overseas prime contractor.</p>
			<p>This is because the terms and conditions for things such as liquidated damages are so onerous as to discourage bids from any but the largest suppliers.</p>
			<p>These are likely to be the US companies Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, joined by Airbus and a consortium led by Optus that includes Raytheon and Thales.</p>
			<p>The requirement is to have four large, high-capacity, dedicated military communications satellites in geostationary orbit &#150; and because of their complexity each is likely to be in the 3-6 tonne range.</p>
			<p>Given this substantial size and the need to place them in orbit 38,000km above Australia for continuous coverage. it will need a heavy-lift rocket to get them there.</p>
			<p>Because of its current involvement with Defence, Optus believes its experience and that of its partners will be taken into account.</p>
			<p>Nick Leake, head of Satellite and Space Systems says: &ldquo;As Australia&rsquo;s largest and most experienced satellite owner and operator we know how critical satellite communications are for our nation and the ADF.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Australia&rsquo;s SATCOM needs will continue to increase and we believe that Team AUSSAT&rsquo;s proven capability, superior experience and access to leading global technology will deliver a genuine sovereign capability for the ADF and Australia.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>While there are a growing number of suppliers of this capability, because of the need for security for a military satellite the choices are narrowing to either Elon Musk&rsquo;s SpaceX Heavy or European Arianespace, which can offer several launch vehicles. The US United Launch Alliance is another possibility, but that organisation specialises in super-secret missions for the likes of the NSA and has a reputation for being extremely expensive.</p>
			<p>Given the large size of Australia and the need for the ADF to also operate throughout the region, four satellites will be needed. Two will be optimised for coverage extending into the Pacific and Indian Oceans and the other two for support of mobile operations, able to maintain contact with distributed ADF assets, including a headquarters-on-the-move function.</p>
			<p>While it would be technically possible to launch all four satellites on one rocket, that would seem to constitute a very large potential strategic risk in case of technical failure, so launching in pairs seems more likely.</p>
			<p>The timetable suggests that a contract might be signed in late 2023 and this will be followed by a three-year construction phase &#150; quite normal for satellites of this type &#150; with a launch later this decade, perhaps in 2028. This is if everything goes to plan, which seems unlikely given the inability of Defence to manage large technically complex acquisitions that are almost always bedevilled with uncontrolled requirements creep.</p>
			<p>Australia has a vibrant and growing space industry sector, though concentrated in small and medium-sized companies which share a sense of mild disappointment that Defence has not gone far enough in seeking local content. The potential primes are engaged in intense discussions with local industry, but at the end of the day they will once again face internal commercial pressures to use their existing overseas supply chains rather than take a risk on unknown Australian entities.</p>
			<p>Defence explains its thinking: &ldquo;As the duration of the project is likely to be in the order of 25 years, Defence will be seeking to engage a long-term industry partner who has a strong track record in delivering complex space and/or SATCOM-related programs. The Joint Project 9102 request for tender is seeking a highly integrated end-to-end system across the space, ground and control segments to deliver a seamless capability to end-users. A single prime mitigates the risk of schedule disaggregation between these segments and reduces technical integration risk.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Although it is Defence&rsquo;s preference, a single prime is not an essential requirement. Defence will consider splitting acquisition and support work between related companies.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Sky TV gives sneak peek of new set-top box and promises loyalty rewards<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/126809788/sky-tv-gives-sneak-peek-of-new-settop-box-and-promises-loyalty-rewards<br>
			</p>
			<p>Sky TV chief executive Sophie Moloney said customers helped choose the &ldquo;fresh white finish&rdquo; of its next set-top box.</p>
			<p>Sky TV has given shareholders at its annual general meeting a sneak peek of the new set-top box that it expects to start offering to subscribers by the middle of next year.</p>
			<p>Chairman Philip Bowman said the satellite TV and internet streaming device would be key to cementing Sky&rsquo;s position in the entertainment market.</p>
			<p>The new box will double as a MySky recorder and Android media player able to access internet TV services such as Netflix, capable of showing programmes in 4K and will be able to be controlled using commands spoken into its remote, in addition to via the remote&rsquo;s traditional buttons.</p>
			<p>Sky chief executive Sophie Moloney said it was &ldquo;much more than a box upgrade&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>It would provide customers with &ldquo;all their favourite sports and entertainment&rdquo; in one place, with one remote that could be activated by voice, and would be &ldquo;the game-changer&rdquo; that customers said they were looking for, she said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The combination of satellite and internet technology delivers the ultimate in high-quality, reliable video and audio.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Subscribers had helped choose the &ldquo;fresh white finish&rdquo; of the box, she said.</p>
			<p>Sky was also planning rewards for its loyal customers, some of whom had been with Sky since its launch 31 years ago, Moloney said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In the coming period we will deliver a series of initiatives to thank and recognise those Sky box customers who are the strategic strength of our business.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Moloney said this was the first time &ldquo;in a number of years&rdquo; that Sky was talking about a return to revenue growth.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We also expect to see streaming revenue growth outstripping the decline in Sky box revenue for the first time in the 2022 financial year,&rdquo; she said.</p>
			<p>Bowman said he expected next year to be an &ldquo;inflection point&rdquo; for Sky.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It is a year of investment to fuel future growth. Developing Sky Broadband is another key area of investment,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>Bowman said the company had no update on what had happened as a result of its decision to appoint investment banker Jarden to advise on &ldquo;strategic partnerships&rdquo; in the wake of unsolicited approaches from would-be investors.</p>
			<p>The appointment in June inevitably sparked speculation of a possible takeover of Sky.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I think what we were looking for was to establish whether there were any parties out there who could accelerate our strategy within New Zealand, either in terms bringing content rights or perhaps by bringing technology.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>That process was ongoing, but &ldquo;at the current moment there is nothing further to add&rdquo;, he said.</p>
			<p>Bowman said Sky had made good progress in its bid to cash-up its headquarters site in Mt Wellington, despite estate agent Colliers having to delay work on the land sale because of the Delta outbreak.</p>
			<p>Moloney is running the ruler over costs at the time as targeting a return to growth.</p>
			<p>The market response confirmed Sky&rsquo;s board was right to include all of its buildings on the site in the offer, he said.</p>
			<p>Its property strategy involved significantly downsizing its Mt Wellington footprint, a higher-profile presence in central Auckland, and a commitment to an &lsquo;anywhere works&rsquo; programme that would let many of staff &ldquo;work flexibly between their homes and the company&rsquo;s sites&rdquo;, he said.</p>
			<p>Moloney said Sky had hired former Foxtel chief financial officer James Marsh to provide &ldquo;an expert external eye&rdquo; on its costs.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I have been impressed with the way Foxtel has achieved sustainable cost management without compromising on their customer promise and I am pleased to be able to tap into that experience to explore what we can achieve here at Sky,&rdquo; she said.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://news.satnews.com/2021/10/28/thales-alenia-space-contracted-by-telkomsat-to-build-the-hts-113bt-satellite/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Thales Alenia Space has signed a contract with PT Telkom Satelit Indonesia (Telkomsat) as subsidiary of PT Telkom Indonesia (Persero) Tbk (Telkom), a state-owned digital telecommunication company in Indonesia, to build the HTS 113BT satellite.</p>
			<p>This will be a High Throughput Satellite (HTS) telecommunications satellite in C-/Ku-band and will be slotted in an orbital position at 113&deg; East.</p>
			<p>Thales Alenia Space is the program prime and responsible for the design, construction, testing and on-ground delivery of the satellite. The company is also in charge of the early orbital positioning phase (LEOP) and in-orbit tests (IOT).</p>
			<p>In addition, Thales Alenia Space will supply the Ground control segment and will train and support the Customer team of engineers on site. The on-orbit support will also be provided all along the satellite lifetime.</p>
			<p>Built on Thales Alenia Space&rsquo;s Spacebus 4000B2 platform, HTS 113BT will provide more than 32 Gbps capacity over Indonesia. The satellite will weigh about 4 metric tons at launch and will be delivered in early 2024 for a 15-year expected lifetime.</p>
			<p>&quot;After an open international tender conducted by Telkomsat, we are very pleased that Telkomsat has renewed its trust in working with us,&quot; said Herv&eacute; Derrey, President and CEO of Thales Alenia Space. &quot;It's very fulfilling to be able to support our customer's business development after Telkom 3S. HTS 113BT is the fourth telecom program to serve the Indonesian satellite operators confirming that Thales Alenia Space is able to match its customers&rsquo; needs by offering a wide telecom satellites product range.&quot;</p>
			<p>Endi Fitri Herlianto, CEO of Telkomsat, said, &ldquo;HTS 113BT will strengthening connectivity infrastructure across Indonesia archipelago to support digital business by providing better quality of service for Indonesia society.&rdquo;<br>

			</p>
			<p>Thales Alenia Space has signed a prime contractor agreement with PT Telkom Satelit Indonesia (Telkomsat) to build a powerful 32 Gb/s high-throughput satellite. It will be delivered in early 2024 and placed at 113 degrees east.</p>
			<p>The craft will operate in C and Ku-bands. Thales Alenia Space is the prime contractor and responsible for the design, construction, testing and on-ground delivery of the satellite. It is also in charge of the early orbital positioning phase (LEOP) and in-orbit tests (IOT). In addition, Thales Alenia Space will supply the Ground control segment and will train and support the Customer team of engineers on site. The in-orbit support will also be provided all along the satellite&rsquo;s lifetime.</p>
			<p>Built on Thales Alenia Space&rsquo;s historical Spacebus 4000B2 platform, HTS 113BT will provide more than 32 Gbps capacity over Indonesia. The satellite will weigh about 4 metric tons at launch and will be delivered early 2024 for a 15-year expected lifetime.</p>

HTS 113BT is the fourth telecom programme to serve the Indonesian satellite operators confirming that Thales Alenia Space is able to match its customers&rsquo; needs by offering a wide telecom satellites product range,&rdquo; said Herv&eacute; Derrey, President and CEO of Thales Alenia Space.</p>
			<p>The build time is shorter than usual and reflects something of a problem after the retirement of a previous satellite (Palapa D) last year. A replacement was built (Nusantara Dua built by China Great Wall Industry Corporation) and launched on time (April 2020) but its launch vehicle, a Chinese Long March 3B/G2 rocket suffered problems with its third stage reportedly failing. The 5.5 tonnes satellite was lost.</p>
			<p>The satellite was designed to cover regions throughout the Asia Pacific and Australia for C-band transponders and throughout Indonesia for High Throughput services. The satellite could have also been used for VSAT, broadcast, broadband, backbone, and backhaul services.</p>
			<p>However, this loss placed considerable pressure on Indonesia. Under ITU rules a vacant orbital slot can be used by rivals if no replacement is implemented. Indonesia needed to get a satellite into position by December 2024. That dilemma has now been solved with the Thales Alenia announcement.<br>

					From https://ajot.com/news/pacific-international-lines-installs-satellite-communication-for-its-entire-fleet<br>
			</p>
			<p>Singtel to provide robust VSAT solutions for 33 vessels</p>
			<p>Pacific International Lines (PIL) is installing satellite communication, or VSAT, on its entire fleet of around 100 vessels. Singtel, Asia&rsquo;s leading communications technology group, is one of the partners providing PIL with communications and cybersecurity solutions for 33 vessels in PIL&rsquo;s fleet. Such enhancements are part of PIL&rsquo;s digitalisation efforts to continually improve productivity on board its vessels, and to enhance the well-being of its seafarers.</p>

			</p>
			<p>Transpacific Broadband Group International eyes providing satellite broadband service by 2022</p>
			<p>Listed telecommunications firm Transpacific Broadband Group International is eyeing negotiations with low-Earth orbit satellite operators, including Elon Musk's Starlink, as it aims to enter the satellite broadband market.</p>
			<p>In a disclosure on Thursday, October 28, Transpacific said it plans to roll out satellite broadband technology in the Philippines by 2022.</p>
			<p>&quot;We are excited [about] the unlimited prospects of empowering government units, businesses, and millions of Filipino households with advanced satellite internet services to meet their growing requirements for fast and reliable connectivity,&quot; the company said.</p>
			<p>Low-Earth orbit satellites, Transpacific said, provide affordable and fast internet, with a 27-millisecond low-latency bandwidth. They are said to be able to deliver &quot;superior online experience in the next level internet-of-things.&quot;</p>

			<p><b><i>Satellite positioning boost with 10cm accuracy<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.eenewseurope.com/news/satellite-positioning-boost-10cm-accuracy<br>
			</p>
			<p>RUAG Space has developed software that can determine the real-time positioning ten times more accurately than was previously possible.</p>
			<p>More accurate positioning data leads to more precise satellite data and helps to avoid space debris and can also be used for ground-based positioning systems.</p>
			<p>Ruag teams for debris removal spacecraft</p>
			<p>The first Earth-based tests showed positioning accurate down to 10cm using the software on an existing GNSS receiver under simulated space conditions. The company is now developing a low cost receiver for small satellites.</p>
			<p>&quot;The result was impressive,&quot; said Heinz Reichinger, technical lead engineer for navigation receivers and signal processing at RUAG Space. &quot;We were able to determine the satellite's position ten times more accurately than previously possible. This is a quantum leap in high-precision positioning of satellites&quot;</p>
			<p>The test results even significantly exceeded the original expectations of accuracy of 20cm by using an additional position signal from Galileo. To determine the exact position of satellites, RUAG Space's latest navigation receivers combine signals from both Galileo and the American GPS system. &quot;We are using the Galileo signal to position satellites that are in space. But there is currently untapped potential in the Galileo satellites as they transmit signals in several frequency bands,&quot; said Martin Auer, who is leading the study at RUAG Space.</p>
			<p>With the Galileo High Accuracy Service (HAS), Galileo will provide a worldwide, free high-accuracy positioning service aimed at applications that require higher performance such as drones or autonomous vehicles. This service should be available in 2022.</p>
			<p>&quot;A software update can be played on navigation receivers already in space as well as receivers we've already delivered to customers and are still on Earth.&quot;</p>
			<p>The hardware of the devices remains unchanged. ESA, for example, is using the Podrix receiver developed by RUAG Space for the Sentinel-1C environmental satellite built by Thales Alenia Space that will be launched in 2022.</p>
			<p>&quot;The more accurately the satellite's position can be determined, the more precise the environmental data it collects and provides. This potentially unlocks new observations and predictions essential to cope with the effects of climate crisis, for example in exposed coastal cities such as Venice,&quot; said  Fiammetta Diani, Head of Market Development at the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA).</p>
			<p>More accurate data about a satellite's position also helps prevent satellites from colliding in space, providing better space situational awareness (SSA). When satellites collide in orbit, a lot of satellite debris is created. Due to the high speed in orbit, even the smallest debris particles pose a huge threat to other satellites. &quot;The more precise the position of a satellite is known, the better a potential accident can be predicted and, for example, evasive manoeuvres can be carried out. Our more accurate satellite positioning data helps to avoid space debris,&quot; said Heinz Reichinger of RUAG Space.</p>
			<p>For the coming constellations of small satellites, RUAG Space is developing a low-cost navigation receiver that is lighter and smaller than conventional devices and already includes the new software capable of processing the additional Galileo HAS signals as a standard feature.</p>
			<p>The new receivers called &quot;NavRix PinPoint&quot; are more cost-effective due to the use of standardized COTS electronic components.<br>

			</p>
			<p>China launches the Jilin-1 Gaofen 02F satellite on top a Kuaizhou-1A carrier rocket at 2:19 pm, Oct 27, 2021, from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the northwestern Gansu province.  </p>
			<p>China launched a high-resolution Earth-observation satellite into space aboard a Kuaizhou 1A carrier rocket on Wednesday afternoon, according to the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp.</p>
			<p>In a statement, the State-owned space contractor said that the solid-propellant rocket blasted off at 2:19 pm from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China, and placed the satellite - a Jilin-1 Gaofen-02F - into a preset orbit shortly after. The mission marked the 12th flight of the Kuaizhou 1A.</p>
			<p>Developed by Changguang Satellite Technology in Northeast China's Jilin province, the Jilin-1 Gaofen-02F is a high-resolution optical remote-sensing satellite.</p>
			<p>Kuaizhou is the largest solid-propellant rocket class in China. The country's other main rocket class, the Long March series, mainly relies on liquid fuel.</p>
			<p>According to CASIC, the 20-meter tall Kuaizhou 1A has a liftoff weight of about 30 metric tons. It is capable of taking 200 kilograms of payload into a sun-synchronous orbit, or 300 kg of payload into a low-Earth orbit.</p>
			<p>Since its maiden flight in January 2017, the rocket has lifted 21 satellites into space.<br>

			<p><b><i>Discovery APAC names Jhingan as President <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/10/27/discovery-apac-names-jhingan-as-president-and-md/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Discovery has announced Anil Jhingan as its new President and Managing Director of Asia Pacific.</p>
			<p>Jhingan will commence in the role from November 1st, as current regional head Simon Robinson steps away from the APAC business to lead integration planning activities in connection with the proposed WarnerMedia transaction. Jhingan will be based in London and report directly to JB Perrette, President and CEO of Discovery Streaming and International.</p>
			<p>In his new role, Jhingan will lead all of Discovery&rsquo;s businesses across Asia Pacific to drive further growth and diversification of a portfolio that today spans twelve office hubs across the region covering 52 markets, 25 channel brands in 18 languages, as well as the leading streaming service, discovery+.</p>
			<p> Jhingan joined Discovery in 2019 as Executive Vice President of Corporate Development, EMEA and APAC, and has over two decades of international media experience, including across Asia Pacific. His involvement has spanned both traditional TV and digital, pay-TV and free-to-air, content as well as distribution, and across all group business verticals.</p>
			<p>Perrette said: &ldquo;We are fortunate to have a terrific leader in Anil who knows the Asia Pacific markets well, and has already been well integrated with our talented leadership team in the region. APAC remains a key growth driver for Discovery, and Anil&rsquo;s deep industry experience, impressive international track record and strong leadership qualities, working with our expert local teams, will be central in building continued scale and differentiation in this critical region.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Simon is an outstanding executive who, together with strong local leadership, has driven significant expansion in APAC, including the launch of discovery+ in India and the Philippines, as well as increased investment in local content and production,&rdquo; Perrette added. &ldquo;I want to thank Simon for his passion and strong strategic execution &#150; his expertise remains critical in the lead integration role as we look ahead.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Asia Pacific offers immense opportunity for Discovery, with our focus on great local storytelling and ever broadening distribution of our content to audiences across the region,&rdquo; said Jhingan. &ldquo;I could not be more enthused to be working even more closely with our talented teams, as we maintain our strong momentum to drive further growth, during what is a hugely exciting time both across the region and for our company.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Prior to Discovery, Jhingan served as Group Director of M&amp;A and International Development for Sky, where he played key roles in its expansion. Prior to this, he held various senior executive positions at Sky, 21st Century Fox and News Corp.<br>

			<p><b><i>Forecast: Thailand pay-TV services revenue at $1.1bn in 2026 <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/10/27/forecast-thailand-pay-tv-services-revenue-at-1-1bn-in-2026/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Pay-TV service revenue in Thailand is expected to grow at a healthy compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.5 per cent from $734 million in 2021 to $1.1 billion in 2026, supported by growing DTH, cable TV and IPTV subscriptions, according to GlobalData, a data and analytics company.</p>
			<p>GlobalData&rsquo;s Thailand pay-TV Forecast Model indicates that both cable TV and IPTV revenues will increase at a CAGR of 4.7 per cent and 41.3 per cent, respectively, during 2021-2026 period.</p>
			<p>Despite an increase in total pay-TV revenue, the average monthly spend per pay-TV account will fall from $8.75 to $7.56 between 2021 and 2026, owing to the competitive pricing strategies being adopted by pay-TV operators to retain their subscriber base.</p>
			<p>Aasif Iqbal, Telecom Analyst at GlobalData, said: &ldquo;DTH will remain the leading platform to deliver pay-TV services in Thailand in 2021, However, IPTV subscriptions will surpass DTH subscriptions in 2023 and will go on to account for 56.6 per cent share of the total pay-TV subscriptions by the end of 2026. This growth will be driven by the rising adoption of multi-play packages with integrated IPTV services, as operators like TrueOnline promote fixed broadband bundles with access to IPTV services.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;TrueVisions will lead the pay-TV market and account for an estimated 31.8 per cent share of the total pay-TV subscriptions in 2021. The operator will maintain its leadership in pay-TV segment given its high subscriber share in all the three segments i.e., DTH, cable-TV and IPTV and focus on distributing premium content to Thai users to compete with OTT video platform providers in the pay-TV market.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>SES-17 successfully launched <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/10/25/ses-17-successfully-launched/<br>
			</p>
			<p>An Arianespace rocket has successfully launched SES&rsquo;s latest satellite &#150; its most comprehensive with almost 200 spot beams covering the Americas, the Caribbean and Atlantic. Launch was at 02.10am UTC on October 24th</p>
			<p>SES-17 is an all Ka-band craft and will eventually operate from the 67.1 degrees West slot and is primarily designed to serve in-flight demand and passengers on cruise ships.</p>
			<p>The satellite is an &lsquo;all-electric&rsquo; model that will use its own on-board electric thrusters to achieve its final orbit. It should be on station and ready for work around the middle of 2022.</p>
			<p>Built by Thales Alenia Space, SES-17 marks an important milestone in satellite technology as the first Ka-band geostationary satellite to embark a fully digital payload powered the most powerful digital transparent processor (DTP) ever placed in orbit. The craft has the ability to dynamically change the power and frequency allocation of any beam, means that SES-17 can adapt to changing customer needs in real-time.</p>
			<p>When operational, anchor customer Thales InFlyt Experience will use SES-17&rsquo;s connectivity to power its next-generation aviation connectivity solution, FlytLIVE. Thales InFlyt Experience will ensure both crew and passengers will have an always-on high-speed Wi-Fi connection at peak times and in high-traffic routes while optimising bandwidth.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s launch of SES-17 is an exciting milestone for our FlytLIVE Connectivity Solution currently flying within the United States,&rdquo; said Craig Olson, VP/Thales InFlyt Experience. &ldquo;The network and satellite architecture was specifically developed for the unique connectivity requirements of our commercial aviation customers and their passengers. With SES-17, FlytLIVE will provide full coverage for the entire Americas and North Atlantic Corridor delivering an unmatched connectivity experience in the air.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.space.com/japan-launching-qzs-1r-navigation-satellite<br>
			</p>
			<p>Japan's H-2A rocket launched a new navigation satellite into orbit on Monday (Oct. 25).</p>
			<p>The rocket lifted off from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan at 10:19 p.m. EDT Monday (0219 GMT, or 11:19 a.m. local time on Tuesday, Oct. 26), according to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which builds and operates H-2A rockets the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). &quot;It was really beautiful launch,&quot; the company tweeted after a successful liftoff. </p>
			<p>The satellite, QZS-1R, is a replacement for the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System 1 satellite first launched in 2010. The official QZSS website lists four satellites in the constellation: QZS-1, QZS-2, QZS-3 and QZS-4.</p>
			<p>Mitsubishi Heavy Industries confirmed roughly 28 minutes after liftoff that the QZS-R1 satellite had successfully separated from the rocket's upper stage </p>
			<p>The QZSS constellation will eventually consist of a total of seven satellites that fly in an orbit passing through a near-zenith (or directly overhead) above Japan, and QZS-R1 is meant to share nearly the same transmission signals as recent GPS satellites, according to JAXA. It is specially optimized for mountainous and urban regions in Japan, JAXA said.</p>
			<p>Mitsubishi Industries launched the satellite on an H-2A 202 rocket. The launch system has been operational since 2003 and has sent satellites to locations such as Venus (Akatsuki) and Mars (Emirates Mars Mission). This was the first launch of the H2-A since Nov. 29, 2020, when Japan launched an advanced relay satellite with laser communications tech into orbit.<br>

			<p>Thomas L&ouml;ffler, Assistant Vice President, Exhibitions, DWTC, said: &ldquo;Faced with disrupted consumption patterns, the broadcast and content industries are rethinking their business models, introducing new subscription-based digital formats, leveraging direct relationships with consumers, and monetising content rather than relying solely on advertising. The disruption is leading to seismic shifts in the way the sector operates. With industry players looking to build scale through geographic expansion as well as a robust local content inventory, CABSAT 2021 carries unique opportunities to initiate strategic partnerships that will be crucial to future competitiveness.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://mumbrella.com.au/foxtel-group-and-viacomcbs-sign-major-content-distribution-and-apps-deal-709427<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Foxtel Group has signed a series of multi-year agreements with ViacomCBS to provide blockbuster and catalogue Paramount Pictures movies, a large range of hit TV series, the Nickelodeon, Nick Jr and MTV channels, along with integration of the Paramount+ and 10 Play apps onto Foxtel set top boxes in 2022 for Australia.</p>
			<p>The agreements cover thousands of hours of entertainment including movies such as Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible 7 starring Tom Cruise coming in 2022, along with blockbuster franchises such as Transformers, Shrek, Madagascar and Star Trek. The agreements also deliver TV dramas including the pay TV premiere of Blue Bloods, BULL, FBI, FBI: Most Wanted, NCIS and the classic hit series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.</p>
			<p>This deal ensures that Nickelodeon and Nick Jr content will continue to be available to Foxtel and Binge subscribers, including kids&rsquo; series such as PAW Patrol. MTV channel will also remain available to Foxtel and Binge subscribers, including hit shows like Ridiculousness. Binge now has over 730,000 paying subscribers.</p>
			<p>These agreements with ViacomCBS also accelerate Foxtel&rsquo;s streaming aggregation strategy to bring together TV, live and on-demand, all in one place. It will see the recently launched Paramount+ app, and the 10 Play app, integrated into iQ3, iQ4, and the brand new iQ5 set top boxes.</p>

			<p><b><i>Concern over Thaicom sway mars deal<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2202043/concern-over-thaicom-sway-mars-deal<br>
			</p>
			<p>Company has yet to resolve hiring deal</p>
			<p>The board of National Telecom (NT) is reluctant to hire SET-listed Thaicom to operate the control system of Thaicom 4 and 6 satellites under a formal commercial contract following heavy criticism of the move by outsiders who believe the approach would allow Thaicom to have overarching influence on related satellite assets despite its concession having expired.</p>
			<p>Thaicom's 30-year satellite-operating concession contract expired on Sept 10, leading to the transfer of the two satellites to the Digital Economy and Society (DES) Ministry.</p>
			<p>NT, which was founded through the merger of CAT Telecom and TOT, was then assigned to operate the two satellites further.</p>
			<p>However, at the request of NT and the DES Ministry, Thaicom now operates the control system of the two satellites without a formal contract.</p>
			<p>A source at the NT board who requested anonymity said NT staff are not keen to operate the control system of the two satellites, although CAT Telecom earlier sent a group of officers to receive training provided by Thaicom.</p>
			<p>Although the government allows NT to hire any private firms to operate and manage the two satellites, NT has yet to come up with a resolution on the hiring deal although Thaicom's concession expired more than a month ago.</p>
			<p>&quot;It must be accepted that Thaicom staff who have experience with the satellite control system are the most proper personnel to help operate the satellites for NT,&quot; the source said. &quot;Controlling satellites needs specific skills and experience.&quot;</p>
			<p>Insurance terms are another important issue for operating satellite business, the source said. Without skilled personnel, insurance premiums would be high.</p>
			<p>At present, Thaicom helps operate the control system of the two satellites on behalf of NT, at the request of NT and the DES Ministry, the source said.</p>
			<p>It remains unknown when NT will formally hire Thaicom to operate the control system of the two satellites although Thaicom expressed an intention to help.</p>
			<p>&quot;Concerns have been raised by outsiders about NT's possible move to have a formal deal with Thaicom, allowing it to operate the satellites, as they fear that Thaicom would return to have full influence on the whole operation of the related satellite assets although its concession has expired. This, however, is just a hiring contract,&quot; the source said.</p>
			<p>The source said as King Rama IX in 1991 named the national communication satellite programme &quot;Thaicom&quot;, the related assets under the programme must be handled with transparency and take into account the benefits of the state and people.</p>
			<p>DES Minister Chaiwut Thanakamanusorn said the hiring deal between NT and a private company is up to NT's board.</p>
			<p>He accepted that handling the satellite control needs those with expertise to ensure smooth operation and ward off unpredictable damage.</p>
			<p>He said he is aware that NT staff are not keen to handle the satellite control by themselves.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/South_Korea_launches_first_domestic_space_rocket_but_mission_fails_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>South Korea launched its first domestically developed space rocket on Thursday but failed to put its dummy payload into orbit, a setback in the country's attempts to join the ranks of advanced space-faring nations.</p>
			<p>The Korea Space Launch Vehicle II, informally called Nuri and emblazoned with a South Korean flag, rose upwards from Goheung on the southern coast trailing a column of flame.</p>
			<p>All three stages of the rocket worked, taking it to an altitude of 700 kilometres, and the 1.5-tonne payload separated successfully, President Moon Jae-in said after watching the launch at the control centre.</p>
			<p>But &quot;putting a dummy satellite into orbit remains an unfinished mission&quot;, he announced.</p>
			<p>&quot;Though it fell short of achieving its goals perfectly, we have achieved very good feats with our first launch.&quot;</p>
			<p>Another attempt will be made in May, he added.</p>
			<p>&quot;Countries that lead in space technology will lead the future. And we are not too late to do it.&quot;</p>
			<p>Cheering and applause had earlier broken out in the control centre as the flight proceeded according to plan and appeared to be successful.</p>
			<p>South Korea has risen from the ashes of war to become the world's 12th-largest economy and a technologically advanced nation, home to the planet's biggest smartphone and memory chip maker, Samsung Electronics.</p>
			<p>But it has lagged in the headline-making world of spaceflight, where the Soviet Union led the way with the first satellite launch in 1957, closely followed by the United States.</p>
			<p>In Asia, China, Japan and India all have advanced space programmes, and the South's nuclear-armed neighbour North Korea was the most recent entrant to the club of countries with their own satellite launch capability.</p>
			<p>Ballistic missiles and space rockets use similar technology and Pyongyang put a 300-kilogramme (660-pound) satellite into orbit in 2012 in what Western countries condemned as a disguised missile test. </p>
			<p>Even now, only six nations -- not including North Korea -- have successfully launched a one-tonne payload on their own rockets.</p>
			<p>The three-stage Nuri rocket has been a decade in development at a cost of 2 trillion won ($1.6 billion). It weighs 200 tonnes and is 47.2 metres (155 feet) long, fitted with a total of six liquid-fuelled engines.</p>
			<p>- Aiming for the Moon -</p>
			<p>But the South Korean space programme has a chequered record -- its first two launches in 2009 and 2010, which in part used Russian technology, both ended in failure, the second one exploding two minutes into the flight and Seoul and Moscow blaming each other.</p>
			<p>Eventually a 2013 launch succeeded, but still relied on a Russian-developed engine for its first stage.</p>
			<p>The satellite launch business is increasingly the preserve of private companies, notably Elon Musk's SpaceX, whose clients include the US space agency NASA and the South Korean military.</p>
			<p>But one expert said a successful Nuri launch could offer South Korea &quot;infinite&quot; potential.</p>
			<p>&quot;Rockets are the only means available to mankind to go out into space,&quot; Lee Sang-ryul, the director of the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, told local paper Chosun Biz ahead of the launch.</p>
			<p>&quot;Having such technology means we have fulfilled basic requirements to join this space exploration competition.&quot;</p>
			<p>Thursday's mission was one step on an increasingly ambitious space programme for South Korea, which Moon previously said would seek to launch a lunar orbiter next year, after he inspected a Nuri engine test in March.</p>
			<p>At the time, he said: &quot;We will realise the dream of landing our probe on the Moon by 2030.&quot;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/10/21/vizio-could-be-forced-to-share-smartcast-source-code-in-lawsuit-brought-by-non-profit/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Television maker Vizio has been sued by a non-profit firm over allegations of general public license (GPL) violations.</p>
			<p>The California lawsuit brought by New York-based Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) alleges that Vizio breached two public licenses by using and modifying open-source software without making its source code publicly accessible. The organisation alleges that the Vizio&rsquo;s TV products built on its SmartCast system contain &ldquo;unfairly appropriated from a community of developers who intended consumers to have very specific rights to modify, improve, share, and reinstall modified versions of the software.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>SFC is a nonprofit that focuses on ethical technology whose sponsors include Google, Red Hat and Mozilla. </p>
			<p>It calls the case &lsquo;historic&rsquo; as it is &ldquo;the first legal case that focuses on the rights of individual consumers&rdquo; as beneficiaries to the licenses. According to the lawsuit, a consumer of a product such as this has the right to access the source code so that it can be modified, studied, and redistributed.</p>
			<p>SFC has not demanded that the case result in monetary penalties for Vizio, but asked the court for an order requiring Vizio to share the code. </p>
			<p>Karen M. Sandler, the organisation&rsquo;s executive director, said: &ldquo;We are asking the court to require Vizio to make good on its obligations under copyleft compliance requirements. Software Freedom Conservancy is standing up for customers who are alienated and exploited by the technology on which they increasingly rely.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The global supply chain shortages that have affected everything from cars to consumer electronics underscore one of the reasons why it is important to be able to repair products we already own. Even without supply chain challenges, the forced obsolescence of devices like TVs isn&rsquo;t in the best interest of the consumer or even the planet. This is another aspect of what we mean by &lsquo;ethical technology.&rsquo; Throwing away a TV because its software is no longer supported by its manufacturer is not only wasteful, it has dire environmental consequences. Consumers should have more control over this, and they would if companies like Vizio played by the rules.&ldquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>

			</p>

			<p>SAN FRANCISCO &#150; LeoLabs announced plans Oct. 19 to construct two phased-array radars in Western Australia, the sixth site for the Silicon Valley startup&rsquo;s global space-tracking network.</p>
			<p>The Western Australia LeoLabs site was selected in part because its longitude provides a view of launch trajectories from Asia.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Our whole mission is to drive transparency in space,&rdquo; Dan Ceperley, LeoLabs CEO and co-founder, told SpaceNews. &ldquo;We want to be able to capture when new satellites are deployed. This site will be helpful for doing that.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The Western Australia site also will help LeoLabs observe satellites and space debris traveling over the Southern Hemisphere, Ceperley said.</p>
			<p>Historically, there have been fewer space-tracking radars and optical telescopes in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons the U.S. Air Force authorized prime contractor Lockheed Martin to survey a Western Australia site for a second Space Fence, a ground-based S-band radar to track objects in orbit. The U.S. Space Force declared the original Space Fence, located on Kwajalein Island in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, operational in 2020, but has not obtained congressional funding to construct a second Space Fence.</p>
			<p>Western Australia is LeoLabs&rsquo; second Southern Hemisphere site. The company operates two S-band radars in New Zealand to detect objects in low Earth orbit as small as 2 centimeters in diameter.</p>
			<p>In addition, LeoLabs operates radars in Alaska, Texas and Costa Rica. LeoLabs announced plans in June to install two space-tracking radars in the Azores archipelago.</p>
			<p>When LeoLabs was founded in 2016, company executives intended to establish a network of radars at six sites around the world. As launch activity continue to accelerate, LeoLabs intends &ldquo;to keep charging forward,&rdquo; Ceperley said. &ldquo;We see a lot of benefit from having these additional radar sites.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>LeoLabs plans to deploy radars at 24 locations around the world, Curtis Hernandez, LeoLabs government relations director, said Oct. 19 at the 2021 Value of Space Summit.</p>
			<p>With each new radar, LeoLabs increases the frequency of its observation of individual satellites and pieces of orbital debris. The increased frequency leads to more accurate data and improves the firm&rsquo;s ability to assess potential collisions.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The West Australian Space Radar also adds more timely updates on critical events in LEO, including collisions, breakups, maneuvers, new launches and re-entries,&rdquo; Terry van Haren, the former Royal Australian Air Force air and space attache in Washington who serves as LeoLabs Australia managing director, said in a statement.</p>
			<p>LeoLabs is recruiting employees in Australia.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Terry is building a team to leverage these radars, the software and other technology that we have to turn Australia into a space domain awareness superpower,&rdquo; Ceperley said.</p>
			<p>LeoLabs currently tracks about 17,000 objects in low Earth orbit. With its expanding space radar network, the firm intends to track 250,000 objects.<br>

			<p>Wildlife and nature brand Love Nature has landed in Australia on Seven Network&rsquo;s streaming service 7plus.</p>
			<p>The channel offers a wide range of award-winning series, documentaries and programming all based around nature and animals.</p>
			<p>Love Nature&rsquo;s FAST channel will offer 7plus audiences special programming events, such as Safari Week, running from November 8-12. Other content available via Love Nature includes Wildest New Zealand, Tales from Zambia and Brazil Untamed.</p>
			<p>This is the latest international expansion for Love Nature, which is available in over 135 countries to reach over 365 million households globally.</p>
			<p>Carlyn Staudt, Global General Manager, Love Nature, said: &ldquo;Partnering with 7plus provides an incredible opportunity to bring Love Nature&rsquo;s natural history programming to its highly engaged audiences across Australia, free of charge.

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.sportingnews.com/au/football/news/network-10-and-paramount-plus-pick-up-fa-cup-broadcast-rights-in-australia-could-the-premier-league-be-next/19vnzwr2zyrkt1hrk370pceyfr<br>
			</p>
			<p>Network 10 have confirmed they have acquired the broadcast rights to the FA Cup for the 2021-22 campaign. </p>
			<p>Their coverage of the historic competition will kick off on November 7 with games to be shown on Network 10 and new streaming service Paramount Plus. </p>
			<p>In conjunction with parent company ViacomCBS, 10 have invested heavily in the sport recently having picked up all available Australian football rights including the A-Leagues, FFA Cup and non-World Cup matches involving the Matildas and Socceroos. </p>
			<p>Their latest acquisition of the FA Cup is their first foray into foreign football rights and suggests they could be looking at making a bid for the English Premier League as well. </p>
			<p>The current deal for the EPL, held by Optus Sport, expires at the end of this season with ViacomCBS seen as one of four serious candidates to land the competition. </p>
			<p>The Sydney Morning Herald recently reported that a blind auction in November will decide who gets the Premier League rights moving forward with Amazon Prime and Stan Sport also in the frame to challenge Optus.</p>
			<p>With Australian football rights sewn up, tapping into Australian fans of other leagues has been previously touted as one way to grow the A-Leagues fan base moving forward. </p>
			<p>&quot;I&rsquo;ve always said I don&rsquo;t need to go out and convince a 45-year-old rugby union fan to suddenly love football or the A-League for that matter,&quot; Australian Professional Leagues (APL) managing director Danny Townsend said via a Sports Pro video conference in July. </p>
			<p>&quot;What I want to focus on is the Liverpool fan that&rsquo;s never been to an A-League game and based on COVID isn&rsquo;t going to Anfield anytime soon to get their live football fix.</p>
			<p>&quot;So how do we do that? We&rsquo;ve got to be adjacent, we&rsquo;ve got to give them a chance to taste our version of the game...&quot;</p>
			<p>With the FA Cup and FFA Cup now to be broadcast in the same place, it would seem the APL are on their way to achieving just that. </p>
			<p>Leicester City are the reigning FA Cup champions with the first round proper to kick off on the first weekend in November. <br>

			<p>Specialists of the Yuzhny Space Center (a branch of the Center for the Operation of Ground-Based Space Infrastructure Facilities within Roscosmos) unloaded the satellites and transported them to site No. 92 at the Baikonur spaceport, the statement says. &ldquo;As the next stage of technological measures, the items will be accepted and autonomously prepared at the assembly and testing facility,&rdquo; Roscosmos added.</p>
			<p>A Russian Proton carrier rocket is set to orbit the Ekspress-AMU3 and Ekspress-AMU7 satellites. The satellites were earlier expected to be launched in 2020. CEO of the Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems Company Nikolai Testoyedov told TASS in September last year that the production of the satellites was being delayed over the late delivery of payloads for these space vehicles from Italy due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
			<p>Roscosmos Chief Dmitry Rogozin announced in December last year that the launch of these satellites had been rescheduled for the end of 2021.<br>

				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/10/20/serie-a-stays-on-youtube-in-mena/<br>
			</p>
			<p>As Italy&rsquo;s Serie A continues to lack a broadcaster in MENA, the league has announced that it will continue to air matches on YouTube for free in the region.</p>
			<p>The league had previously launched a country-by-country MENA broadcast rights tender, after relations with previous rights holder beIN Media soured. On its return from the Covid-19-enforced hiatus, beIN staged a broadcast blackout of the league with the demand of a steep discount on its US$500 million regional rights deal. It accused the league of not doing enough to combat piracy, while tensions were already high following a deal with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia to host a number of Suppercoppa fixtures in the country. </p>
			<p>As such, Serie A announced a deal with Google-owned YouTube for the start of the season, and that arrangement will be continued in the short term following a league assembly meeting. YouTube will host five fixtures each matchweek with Arabic commentary.</p>
			<p>During the meeting, the league also announced that it will grant a  &ldquo;non-exclusive one-month exploratory mandate to various licensees&rdquo;, with CEO Luigi De Siervo charged with granting these mandates.</p>
			<p>Reuters reports that De Siervo has been authorised to mandate sports marketing agencies to secure a broadcast deal in MENA worth &euro;50 million per season.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Asia Satellite Telecommunications Company Limited (AsiaSat), the Asia satellite solutions provider, has acquired a strategic stake in One Click Go Live, a company incorporated in Hong Kong and specialised in video live streaming services and solutions.</p>

			<p><b><i>A Chinese satellite is now active weeks after an anomaly during launch<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacenews.com/a-chinese-satellite-is-now-active-weeks-after-an-anomaly-during-launch/<br>
			</p>
			<p>HELSINKI &#151; The classified Chinese satellite Shiyan-10 is now active, nearly three weeks after suffering an anomaly during launch that appeared to result in the loss of the spacecraft.</p>
			<p>China launched the experimental Shiyan-10 satellite on a Long March 3B from Xichang Satellite Launch Center Sept. 27 but the usual declaration of success did not follow. </p>
			<p>Data from U.S. Space Force&rsquo;s 18th Space Control Squadron (SPCS) later indicated the payload entered a geosynchronous transfer orbit of 177 x 40,105-kilometer orbit inclined by 51 degrees. </p>
			<p>Chinese state media hours later reported that rocket flight was normal, placing the satellite accurately into its intended transfer orbit, but that satellite operating conditions were abnormal. Specific reasons being further analyzed and investigated.</p>
			<p>A 2019 Long March 3B flight saw a insertion of ChinaSat-18 (Zhongxing-18) into geosynchronous transfer orbit, but state media later reported that the satellite had functional abnormally, marking its last activity and update.</p>
			<p>But while ChinaSat-18 was lost, with its orbit slowly decaying (184 by 32,330 kilometers), Shiyan-10 has now managed to raise its orbit. </p>
			<p>New orbital elements published by SPCS indicate that Shiyan-10 has performed small burns to raise the perigee of the orbit to 567 x 40,428 km. This suggests smaller, backup engines are being used instead of a larger burn by a main engine to circularize the orbit.</p>
			<p>While now active, firing its engines more than two weeks after launch, the health and operational status of the satellite&#151;along with its intended purposes&#151;remain unknown.</p>
			<p>Neither Chinese state media nor the country&rsquo;s main space contractor, the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. (CASC) has commented on the development. </p>
			<p>A social media post of an apparent Shiyan-10 &lsquo;big red screen&rsquo;&#151;which are displayed at Chinese mission control centers following declaration of launch success&#151;appeared briefly on social media before being swiftly deleted. </p>
			<p>An announcement may be made if and when the satellite reaches its intended orbit.</p>
			<p>Shiyan are understood to be experimental satellites intended to test new satellite technologies, with the first in the series being launched in 2004.</p>
			<p>The Long March 3B is a workhorse launch vehicle for launches to GTO. The China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT), a major CASC subsidiary and producer of the launcher, stated in early August that it planned seven further Long March 3B launches before the end of the year. Three of these have now taken place, but it remains unclear if the issue with Shiyan-10 could have been related to the launch vehicle and if delays to the schedule will become apparent.</p>
			<p>CASC has conducted 35 launches so far in 2021 and is aiming for more than 40 before the end of the year.<br>

			<p><b><i>Report: Cord-cutting continues to hurt Taiwan pay-TV <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/10/19/report-cord-cutting-continues-to-hurt-taiwan-pay-tv/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The total pay-TV service revenue in Taiwan is expected to decline at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 0.5 per cent from $1.18 billion in 2020 to $1.15 billion in 2025 due to the accelerated cord cutting trend in the country and falling pay-TV average revenue per user (ARPU), according to GlobalData, a data and analytics company.</p>
			<p>An analysis of GlobalData&rsquo;s Taiwan Pay-TV Forecasts indicates a tepid growth in the country&rsquo;s overall pay-TV accounts, and a decline in average monthly spend per pay-TV account from $14.03 to $13.23 over the forecast period 2020-2025, which can be attributed to increasing consumer shift towards OTT video services. Cable TV subscriptions are expected to decline at a CAGR of 1.5 per cent over 2020-2025.</p>
			<p>Pradeepthi Kantipudi, Telecom Analyst at GlobalData, commented: &ldquo;Despite its diminishing fortune, cable TV will remain the leading pay-TV service platform in Taiwan in terms of subscription share during the forecast period and will account for 62 per cent of the total pay-TV subscriptions by the end of 2025.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>GlobalData forecasts IPTV subscriptions to grow at a CAGR of 5.5 per cent over the same period, driven by fixed broadband network expansions to deliver high-speed internet services.</p>
			<p>Pradeepthi concluded: &ldquo;Chungwa Telecom is expected to maintain its leading position in terms of subscriptions through 2025 driven by its strong foothold in the IPTV segment. The operator&rsquo;s leading position can be attributed to the expanding fibre-optic network, which enables to deliver high quality IPTV content.&rdquo;<br>

			</p>
			<p>Italy&rsquo;s Guardia di Finanza (Financial Police) has busted a pay-TV piracy ring and cited some 1,800 people for pay-TV subscription fraud.</p>
			<p>They were all sold pirated IPTV subscriptions to pay-TV platforms, including Mediaset Premium, Sky, DAZN and Disney Channel, by a 70-year old man living in Varese.</p>
			<p>The man, who is under investigation on suspicion of &ldquo;counterfeiting, violation of intellectual property and computer fraud&rdquo;, hacked illegally into the platforms and sold pirated subscriptions in many Italian regions online.</p>
			<p>He is alleged to have illegally profited &euro;500,000 between 2017 and 2020 from his activity.</p>
			<p>The illegal subscribers have been issued with fines totaling some &euro;300,000 and cited for receiving stolen goods.</p>
			<p>The police probed bank accounts in order to discover evidence of the illegal subscriptions. The customers made payments to the Varese &lsquo;reseller&rsquo; by means of bank transfers or top-ups with prepaid cards.<br>

			<p><b><i>ClixTV goes live <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/10/19/clixtv-goes-live/<br>
			</p>
			<p>ClixTV, a multi-platform streamer at the intersection of entertainment, e-commerce and technology, has launched its free streaming service on over 80 channels, web, and apps, including Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, IMDb TV, Box One, LG Smart TV, and all Plex TV channels as well as on ClixTV.com, IOS and Android.</p>
			<p>ClixTV says it reaches more than 100 million online viewers monthly, and 120 million OTT television homes.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;ClixTV is reinventing the entertainment experience for consumers on every screen to simplify the search for great content and tantalise viewers with compelling programming that they may never have known about,&rdquo; said ClixTV CEO and Founder, Ed Sullivan. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve also created unique benefits for creators, distributors and advertisers caught in the vortex of technology-meets-media.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We believe it&rsquo;s a critical time to use fast-forward tech and savvy marketing to turn the pain of what-to-watch into a fun, fast and free experience,&rdquo; said ClixTV Chief Marketer and co-founder, Stacy Jolna. &ldquo;ClixTV believes producers, streamers, advertisers and fans should embrace a similar goal: make it enjoyable to watch what you want, when you want from the very first click across every platform, on any screen.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In the streaming wars ClixTV is uniquely everyone&rsquo;s ally, delivering clarity in a time of chaos,&rdquo; said former Sony Pictures Entertainment President, Man Jit Singh. &ldquo;With the abundance of long form entertainment offerings, it takes the average person thirty-seven minutes to find something to watch. That is a clear problem screaming for a solution.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;By catering to platform-agnostic viewers who want entertainment right now, a new media venture has the opportunity to thrive,&rdquo; said international media valuations expert, Larry Gerbrandt. &ldquo;The streaming industry has matriculated from its adolescence with an abundance of great content, but it&rsquo;s often hard to find. The vital need in the industry is this: a streamer that can support the industry by pointing viewers to programming that might have been overlooked as well as providing a platform for emerging video talent. By aligning multiple agendas &#150; short attention spans, multi-platform proclivities, and by becoming an asset to the mega streaming giants &#150; a new future-thinking media venture can prove to be an indispensable ancillary arm to the industry, to creators and advertisers seeking new ways for viewers to find what they wish to watch.&ldquo;</p>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://tvblackbox.com.au/page/2021/10/18/kayo-offers-free-access-to-first-round-of-t20-world-cup-to-offset-lack-of-free-to-air-coverage/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Foxtel Group has confirmed it will provide free access to first round of the upcoming ICC Men&rsquo;s T20 World Cup tournament as part of its Kayo Freebies package.</p>
			<p>The Foxtel Group holds Australian broadcast rights to the tournament which begins this week in the United Arab Emirates. The exclusive rights deal means Australian cricket fans will be unable to watch our national team compete in the tournament on free-to air television for the first time.</p>
			<p>While the final of the T20 World Cup is included in the Federal Government Sport Anti- Siphoning list, its understood no Australian free-to-air broadcaster expressed interest in the competition, allowing Foxtel to lock in the exclusive rights deal.</p>
			<p>The World Cup, set to be held in the United Arab Emirates, and will see first round matches played from 17 &#150; 23 October with eight teams vying for four remaining spots in the Super 12s stage of the tournament.</p>
			<p>The first round begins Sunday, 17 October, with Oman taking on Papua New Guinea, and concludes on Saturday, 23 October when Sri Lanka face the Netherlands. Super 12 begins 23 October with the World Cup Final scheduled for 14 November, with every match available exclusively on Fox Cricket and streaming live and on-demand on Kayo.</p>
			<p>Kayo Sports Director of Marketing, Kim McConnie said:<br>
				&ldquo;Giving sports fans the opportunity to experience events such as the T20 World Cup and Formula 1 for free gives even more Australians an opportunity to get a taste of the world-class content and user experience on Kayo.<br>
				&ldquo;The World Cup is a major international event and by offering the first round on Freebies we will extend the audience giving more people access to watch this big event. Whether they are going for the Aussies or one of the other 15 nations, they&rsquo;ll get to see their team in action.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>In addition to the World Cup action, Kayo Minis for all Weber Women&rsquo;s Big Bash League matches will be made available on Freebies.</p>
			<p>The Freebies content will complement a smorgasbord of world-class cricket available on Kayo this summer, which includes every 2021/2022 Ashes Test, every Men&rsquo;s and Women&rsquo;s International played in Australia, every match of the Men&rsquo;s ICC T20 World Cup and every match of the KFC BBL and Weber WBBL available live and ad-break free during play, with Fox Cricket&rsquo;s world-class commentary team.</p>
			<p>The action doesn&rsquo;t stop at cricket, with Formula 1 Minis to be added to Freebies for every race in October, November and December. This includes the United States Grand Prix, Mexican Grand Prix, Brazilian Grand Prix, Qatar Grand Prix, Saudi Arabian Grand Prix and Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.</p>
			<p>Formula 1 Minis are a condensed 30-minute highlights package of all the best bits from the main race and will join all practice and qualifying sessions on Freebies.</p>
			<p>New on-demand content will also be added to Freebies, with a host of press conferences, archive fights and behind-the-scenes content in the week leading up Tim Tszyu&rsquo;s next fight against Japan&rsquo;s Takeshi Inoue on Wednesday, 17 November.</p>
			<p>Cricket fans will also be able to warm up for The Ashes with archived matches and interviews on Freebies.<br>

			<p><b><i>Chinese Shiyan-10 satellite raises its orbit after initial problems<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/10/shiyan-10-fails-in-orbit-after-launch/<br>
			</p>
			<p>After initial reports that the Chinese Shiyan-10 satellite failed after a nominal launch of the rocket, it is now confirmed that the satellite was reactivated and is raising its orbit from the initial deployment height.</p>
			<p>China launched the Shiyan-10 satellite on a Long March 3B/E rocket at 8:20 UTC on September 27, lifting off from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center. The name and purpose of the payload were not confirmed before the launch, however, an object was cataloged in orbit a few hours after the launch, confirming it reached orbit.</p>
			<p>The payload was deployed into a 177 km by 40,104 km geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) with an inclination of 51.04 degrees. It now raised its orbit to 456.9 km by 39,934.0 km. It was confirmed after the launch that the payload was Shiyan-10, which experienced abnormal operating conditions during launch and was declared a failure at first. The Long March 3B launch vehicle was confirmed to have performed normally during the launch.</p>
			<p>Shiyan Weixing spacecraft are technology test satellites that are built by different providers as a pathfinder for new satellite technologies. The first Shiyan satellite was launched in April 2004 on a Long March 2C rocket. After that, eight more missions followed to test more experimental technologies.</p>
			<p>The last one was the Shiyan-9 payload, which launched on a Long March 7A (also known as Chang Zheng 7A) in March 2021 to a geostationary orbit (GEO). While the true function of this satellite was never revealed, it is speculated that it is used to perform high-resolution and high orbit optical remote sensing.</p>
			<p>Long March 3B/E lifts off from LC-2 at Xichang with Shiyan-10</p>
			<p>The Long March 3B/E is the upscaled version of the smaller 3B variant The 3B/E features an upgrade to the first stage and the liquid rocket boosters, which results in an increased payload capacity of the rocket to GTO and GEO. It can launch up to 11,500 kg to LEO and 5,500 kg to GTO.</p>
			<p>The majority of the 66 payloads that the rocket has launched so far had destinations of either GTO or GEO, with only a few rare exceptions in which it launched a payload into a Medium Earth Orbit (MEO). Most of the payloads are communications and telecommunications satellites, which usually require the orbits Long March 3B is built for.</p>
			<p>Since 2007, the 3B/E has flown 64 missions successfully, which is a record for the Long March rocket family. Its first launch was NigComSat-1, a Nigerian communication satellite. After that, Long March 3B/E only had one partial failure and one complete failure.</p>
			<p>During the launch of the Chinasat 9A mission in June 2017, the Reaction Control System (RCS) of the rocket stopped working during the coast phase, which resulted in a sub-planned payload release. The satellite, however, used its onboard propulsion to reach the desired orbit even with the rocket underperforming.</p>
			<p>The last, and only complete failure, occurred during the Palapa-N1 launch in April 2020, in which the third stage failed to ignite and the satellite failed to reach orbit, resulting in a complete loss of payload.</p>
			<p>The medium-lift vehicle is 56 meters tall with a liftoff mass of 458,970 kg. It is built by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology and consists of three stages, with the option to include a fourth stage as a kick stage.</p>
			<p>The first stage of the rocket stands 24.76 meters tall with a diameter of 3.35 meters. It uses a cluster of four YF-20C engines which are called YF-21C in this bundled configuration. At liftoff, they provide 2961.6 kN of thrust with a specific impulse of 260.69 seconds.</p>
			<p>The hypergolic engines on the Long March 3B/E ignite and Shiyan-10 lifts off from LC-2 at Xichang</p>
			<p>The engines use the hypergolic combination of dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) and dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) as propellants, which burn when they contact each other. This hypergolic mix is used on the first, second, and optional fourth stage of the Long March 3B/E as well as the four liquid rocket boosters.</p>
			<p>These four side boosters have a height of 16.1 meters with a slightly smaller diameter of 2.25 meters. They use a single YF-25 engine each, which is just the booster engine name for the YF-20C that the center core uses as well. Together with the center core, the rocket reaches a liftoff thrust of 5923,2 kN with all eight YF-20Cs igniting at launch.</p>
			<p>After a bit more than two minutes into the flight, all four liquid rocket boosters are jettisoned from the main stage, leaving the center core. After that separates 18 seconds later, the second stage ignites and takes over. It is 12.92 meters in length with the same diameter as the first stage and uses a single YF-22E engine. This engine provides up to 742 kN of thrust with the four YF-23F vernier engines to steer the rocket during the operation of the second stage.</p>
			<p>Shortly after the second stage is depleted, the third stage ignites with its two YF-75 engines. The stage has a length of 12.38 meters and stores liquid hydrogen and oxygen as fuel for the two engines. This stage can be shut down and started multiple times to reach the desired GTO or GEO orbit. Each of the engines provides 78.45 kN of thrust at a high specific impulse of 438 seconds.</p>
			<p>At last, there is an optional Yuanzheng-1 fourth stage. It is a kick stage that can provide up to 6.5 kN of thrust with its YF-50D engine, and was last used on the BeiDou-3 M19/20 mission in December 2019. However, it was not used with this launch.</p>
			<p>This launch was conducted from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center, in the southern part of China. It started operations in 1984 and since then has hosted a variety of Chinese rockets, including every launch of the Long March 3B family. The launch complex that was used in this launch was LC-2, which is one of the three launch complexes at Xichang.<br>

			<p><b><i>OneWeb launch success continues <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/10/15/oneweb-launch-success-continues/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications company OneWeb has confirmed its successful launch of 36 satellites by Arianespace from the Vostochny Cosmodrome. This brings OneWeb&rsquo;s total in-orbit constellation to 358 satellites, over half of OneWeb&rsquo;s entire 648 LEO satellite fleet that will deliver high-speed, low-latency global connectivity.</p>
			<p>Lift-off occurred on October 14th at 10:40am BST. OneWeb&rsquo;s satellites were separated from the rocket in nine batches over a period of 3 hours 52 minutes with signal acquisition on all 36 satellites confirmed.</p>
			<p>OneWeb is now over the halfway point toward delivering global service by 2022 and is seeing growing demand from telecommunications providers, ISPs, and governments worldwide to offer its low-latency, high-speed connectivity services. OneWeb has raised $2.7 billion since November 2020, with no debt issuance.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Now is a truly exciting time for OneWeb&rsquo;s global communications network,&rdquo; declared Neil Masterson, OneWeb CEO. &ldquo;Our talented team and partners across the globe have made enormous strides while remaining sharply focused on delivering our network. As we continue to expand and solidify new agreements, we see major demand for our services from global customers. I am incredibly proud of the team and all our partners for delivering another successful launch and taking our satellite constellation past the halfway mark.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Copyright suit against Desi TV/Live TV <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/10/15/copyright-suit-against-desi-tv-live-tv/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The International Broadcaster Coalition Against Piracy (IBCAP) has announced another member lawsuit, this one filed in a federal court in New York against South Asian pirate video services branded as Desi TV and Live TV. Consistent with similar lawsuits coordinated by IBCAP, this case also includes claims against a seller of the illegal services &#150; a dealer in Brooklyn, NY known as 786 Wireless and its owner, Rana Afzal.</p>
			<p>Sending a clear message to those who ignore IBCAP&rsquo;s copyright infringement notices, this lawsuit follows a long string of copyright cases coordinated by IBCAP and filed by IBCAP members against pirate services and their resellers, most of which have already resulted in significant damage awards and either a removal of IBCAP protected channels, or a shutdown of the services entirely. In addition, lawsuits filed this year and awaiting decision against other South Asian pirates include Chitram TV for more than $31 million and MyIndianTV for more than $26 million in damages plus injunctive relief.</p>
			<p>The lawsuit was brought by IBCAP member DISH Network and alleges that the operators of the Desi TV and Live TV services engaged in direct copyright infringement by transmitting South Asian channels and content airing on those channels without authorization to users in the United States. The complaint also alleges that a retailer selling the services, 786 Wireless, is liable for secondary copyright infringement for encouraging and materially contributing to the direct infringement by, among other things, facilitating access to the copyrighted works and creating the audience for the infringement.</p>
			<p>Importantly, the complaint alleges that the defendants&rsquo; actions were wilful and malicious for ignoring IBCAP&rsquo;s notices of infringement. The complaint also seeks an injunction against the defendants, and their hosting companies and CDNs, that would prohibit the continued transmission of the channels at issue and that would prohibit any retailers from selling the infringing IPTV services.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This latest case reiterates that IBCAP and its members will not tolerate piracy and will take action against illegal IPTV services and their dealers who ignore our take down notices&rdquo; said Chris Kuelling, executive director of IBCAP. &ldquo;Dealers of these illegal IPTV services need to realise that they are risking their entire business by being involved, and it simply is not worth taking that risk.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>As with prior lawsuits coordinated by IBCAP, NAGRA provided significant investigatory and technical assistance to prepare the evidence necessary to support the case.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;As a long-term partner of IBCAP, NAGRA is proud to have provided intelligence and evidence to support this lawsuit against South Asian pirate video services,&rdquo; said Jean-Philippe Plantevin, VP anti-piracy services at NAGRA. &ldquo;For decades, NAGRA has been committed to helping the industry protect its considerable investment in content production and distribution. Piracy is a problem that has to be met with a defined strategy, the best anti-piracy tools available, and the full engagement of key stakeholders. We are proud to support this latest case, and we will continue to work with IBCAP on similar cases in the future.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.skynews.com.au/business/media/foxtel-launches-its-latest-innovation-in-streaming-with-the-dedicated-news-service-flash/news-story<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Foxtel Group has launched its third streaming offering in as many years with Flash News bringing together more than 20 live and on-demand news sources for $8 per month.</p>
			<p>New streaming services like Kayo and Binge have re-invigorated Foxtel&rsquo;s finances and subscriber numbers. Foxtel CEO Patrick Delany said the pay television&#x2026;</p>
			<p>Foxtel has today launched its third genre-based streaming platform in as many years, announcing the news aggregation service Flash is now available to Australians.</p>
			<p>Flash brings together more than 20 global and local news providers including Sky News Australia, BBC, CNN, Bloomberg, Fox News, GB News and the Wall Street Journal, for $8 per month.</p>
			<p>The platform is integrated with the award-winning technical stack used by Kayo Sports and Binge and is supported by a dedicated editorial team to curate news stories and feature content from the platform&rsquo;s suite of broadcast partners, effectively operating as both a breaking news platform featuring many of the world&rsquo;s biggest outlets as well as a live and on-demand streaming product.</p>
			<p>The launch of Flash has created more than a dozen new Australian media jobs, including the editorial team led by former Editor in Chief of news.com.au, Kate de Brito. </p>
			<p>De Brito told SkyNews.com.au that the Flash team is comprised of &ldquo;a mix of people for editorial roles &#150; some with video skills and others with digital news experience&rdquo;.<br>
				Executive Director of Flash News Kate de Brito at the Foxtel Flash launch at Gravity Studios, Artarmon. Picture: Foxtel / Brett Costello</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Our Head of News James Law is an experienced editor who brings a wealth of experience in digital news and he is joined by our Content Manager Johnathan Barhoumeh who is very experienced in video news,&rdquo; she said.</p>
			<p>Flash CEO, Julian Ogrin, said: &ldquo;Flash is a game-changer in news media. It will transform the way Australians consume the news that matters to them by bringing together the widest range of local and international live news sources in a single, easy to use, feature-packed service. </p>

			<p>When asked by SkyNews.com.au if Foxtel would be turning its attention to creating a fourth new streaming product next year, Ogrin wouldn&rsquo;t be drawn, saying &ldquo;we continue to look at the market for opportunities but right now our focus is on launching Flash and making it successful&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Available on phones, tablets, PCs and TVs, Flash features user innovations including personalisation, allowing users to follow the opinions, topics and news that matter to them and FlashLists, the ability to create and save stories to watch later.</p>
			<p>Soon after launch more features will be available including FlashPoint, providing every angle of every story and FlashNav, getting straight to the big moments of stories faster.<br>
				Flash brings together more than 20 news sources and is available on multiple devices for $8 per month. Picture: supplied.</p>
			<p>In a slick launch presentation streamed from Gravity Studios in Sydney's Artarmon on Tuesday afternoon, Minister for Communications Paul Fletcher joined via video link to congratulate Foxtel on &ldquo;this exciting new service.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We all know that the way people consume news and other information is changing at an extraordinary rate and the innovation that Foxtel is demonstrating across all aspects of its product offering is certainly very much on display with the launch of Flash&rdquo;, Mr Fletcher said.<br>
				Foxtel Group chief executive Patrick Delany has been driving a shift towards innovative streaming products within the media giant. Picture: Supplied</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I think this will quickly come to establish a significant place in the news market in Australia and I think we&rsquo;re going to see many people quickly become used to going to Flash as a place where you can get perspectives and information on both national and global developments from some of the world&rsquo;s leading news organisations and providers.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;So, congratulations Foxtel on the relentless innovation you&rsquo;re showing in developing new products, giving Australians the very best that&rsquo;s on offer and congratulations particularly on the launch of Flash&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Foxtel has undertaken a strategic shift towards its streaming future over the past three years with the launch of Kayo Sports followed by the mid-pandemic rollout of entertainment service Binge.</p>
			<p>Both new services have been a huge success for the Foxtel Group, with CEO Patrick Delany recently revealing at a strategy day that the network now has four million total subscribers, with a million of those added within the past 12 months driven by its streaming platforms.</p>
			<p>The media powerhouse, which is the largest Australian media company based on revenue, also recently announced its streaming-led iQ5 set top box.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/10/13/intelsat-steals-billions-says-ses/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Last week it was an Intelsat motion to its bankruptcy court that accused SES of being &ldquo;on a warpath&rdquo; as far as its allegations over SES claims concerning how the FCC&rsquo;s C-band incentive payments were concerned.</p>
			<p>SES responded on October 11th with a detailed rebuttal saying it had proposed &ldquo;numerous compromises&rdquo; to Intelsat and asked the bankruptcy court to permit SES to take four depositions from Intelsat witnesses &ldquo;who have personal knowledge highly relevant to SES&rsquo;s objections&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>SES, in its motion, alleges that &ldquo;At every stage, and at every decision point, [the] debtors and various creditor groups have manoeuvred to divert value away from Intelsat US LLC.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Intelsat US is SES&rsquo;s contractual counterparty to the C-Band Consortium Agreement, and it is this particular Intelsat entity which is entitled to Intelsat&rsquo;s share of [the FCC&rsquo;s] Accelerated Relocation Payments (ARPs).</p>
			<p>SES also argues that it &ldquo;undisputed&rdquo; that it is Intelsat US which carried out substantially all of the work associated with clearing the C-Band and the FCC&rsquo;s payment of some $3.39 billion.</p>
			<p>However, SES says that Intelsat&rsquo;s bankruptcy Recovery Model allocates &ldquo;a mere&rdquo; and &ldquo;nominal&rdquo; 4.5 per cent of that ARP value to Intelsat US.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;SES is entitled to testimony from percipient witnesses that will allow SES to demonstrate that the Second Amended Plan cannot be confirmed because it steals billions of dollars in value from Intelsat US, which at every relevant point in time has had no one&#151;and in particular the four witnesses whose depositions are at issue in this Motion&#151; protecting its interests and the interests of its creditors,&rdquo; states the SES motion.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/10/13/eutelsats-sat-tv-makes-progress-in-mena/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Last year Eutelsat released its Sat.tv set-top box in the MENA region. The idea was to make it easy for viewers to arrange the hundreds of free-to-view channels available into simple to use menu options complete with channel logos and images.</p>
			<p>Most pay-TV operators have been doing this for years, but in the MENA market &#150; which is dominated by free-to-air channels &#150; the viewing choices are scattered through almost 1000 channels and with little logic in their location.</p>
			<p>Eutelsat has taken on extra staff to handle liaison with electronics retailers throughout the region and to help alert broadcasters to the benefits of the new set-top box.</p>
			<p>Robert Lakos, a Dubai-based consultant who has been advising Eutelsat during the project says there have been challenges especially over the past few months.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Covid triggered two semi-related crisis that have rocked STB supply chains into MENA. The first crisis was the chip shortage which has been felt in many industries. This hit all FTA STBs severely starting in February. Prices shot up on chips and other components and many Asian suppliers put production and delivery on hold. As of right now the ex-factory costs on new production of FTA STBs &#151; those with Sat.tv as well as the non-Sat.tv boxes &#151; has increased roughly +25 per cent &#151; this has been a huge shock to an ecosystem that has gotten used to factory costs always going down, never up,&rdquo; said Lakos.</p>
			<p>Lakos says that crisis No 2 is the cost of freight, commenting: &ldquo;Sending a container carrying upwards of 10,000 STBs from China to Dubai used to cost $2,000. Today that same container costs upwards of $8,000. Delivery to other MENA destinations like Morocco or Egypt has gone up even more. Bear in mind that FTA STBs typically cost around $6 &#150; $8 each so the increase in freight adds an additional 10 percent to landed cost of each unit. Coming on top of the chip crisis this has made it a challenging year for the STB supply chains.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, Sat.tv has delivered considerable progress for watching FTA channels<br>

			<p>Rocket Lab has made its second acquisition, Advanced Solutions, Inc. (ASI), a space software company, for $40 million. The launcher announced Tuesday that the acquisition has been completed, and includes the possibility of an additional $5.5 million performance earnout. </p>
			<p>Colorado-based ASI. offers flight software, mission simulation, and Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC). Rocket Lab said this acquisition will boost its Space Systems portfolio, which includes the Photon spacecraft line. ASI Founder and CEO John Cuseo will continue to lead the team of nearly 60 people based in Colorado, which will grow Rocket Lab&rsquo;s presence in the region. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;The ASI team revolutionized flight software and have enabled some of the most significant space exploration missions. For more than 20 years they have been delivering industry-first, off-the-shelf spacecraft flight software products that enable cost-effective and highly capable constellation and interplanetary missions. By joining forces, we believe it will have a transformative effect on the way spacecraft are designed, built, tested, launched, and operated, further unlocking space&rsquo;s potential,&rdquo; Rocket Lab Founder and CEO Peter Beck commented. </p>
			<p>ASI marks Rocket Lab&rsquo;s first acquisition as the company is in the midst of going public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger, and its second acquisition. Rocket Lab acquired component manufacturer Sinclair Interplanetary in April 2020. As part of its beef up of the Space Systems department, the company recently said it has surpassed the total number of satellite components produced by Sinclair annually and is building a new facility to increase production. </p>
			<p>Rocket Lab is developing into more than a launch company, offering end-to-end spacecraft and launch together. Beck spoke with Via Satellite about this vision after the SPAC was announced, commenting: &ldquo;When you couple both launch and spacecraft as one complete package, there&rsquo;s so much advantage. It&rsquo;s a very powerful model, rather than just focusing on building satellites or just being a freight company.&rdquo; <br>

			<p><b><i>PH Space Agency eyes satellite internet for remote areas<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/10/13/21/ph-space-agency-eyes-satellite-internet-for-remote-areas<br>
			</p>
			<p>MANILA - The Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA) has launched a program to help the country achieve more robust internet connectivity, particularly in remote and far-flung areas.</p>
			<p>During the launching of the INCENTIVISE (Introducing Non-geostationary Satellite Constellations Test Deployments for Improved Internet Service) program, the PhilSA on Tuesday called on new satellite internet operators (SIO) to conduct test deployments and trials in the Philippines. </p>
			<p>It said it will facilitate these &quot;test deployments&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This initiative is intended to help expand internet accessibility.. in hard-to-reach areas through satellite broadband,&rdquo; said PhilSA chief project development officer Agnes May Bantigue.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are targeting companies that operate satellites in so-called non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) for providing internet access. Examples of such NGSO SIOs, include One Web of UK and Starlink of Elon Musk,&quot; she said.</p>
			<p>As of date, there are no known local companies with NGSO technologies.</p>
			<p>Citing a World Bank study, Bantigue said &ldquo;only 46.88% of the population in the Philippines had access to the Internet, making it the country to have the third-lowest penetration rate in the ASEAN region.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The Bangsamoro Region has the lowest internet accessibility, with internet access in just 4.5% of its households. </p>
			<p>In Regions 9 and 10, 93% of households do not have internet connectivity, while 92% of households in Regions 4-B and 5 also cannot access the internet, Bantigue noted.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;So, for these regions, we can perhaps turn to satellites as a means for connecting&#151;for achieving connectivity,&rdquo; she said.</p>
			<p>SATELLITE INTERNET</p>
			<p>Bantigue said satellite internet will &ldquo;bridge the digital divide&rdquo;, which is cost-effective in areas where &ldquo;terrestrial networks can be uneconomical and logistically difficult.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Moreover, satellites can provide urgent communications during disasters and emergencies when terrestrial infrastructure may be disruptive,&rdquo; she said.</p>
			<p>But PhilSA could not say how cost-effective the technology would be yet.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Definitely every infrastructure investment entails capital outlay. So, in terms of affordability, we really need to assess this against the benefits that it will bring to the community. Perhaps in terms of the uses of the internet such as maybe being able to bring education to far-flung areas or being able to conduct TELE-help in far-flung areas, also, financial inclusion,&rdquo; Bantigue said.</p>
			<p>ADVANTAGES OF NGSO</p>
			<p>Bantigue said the new satellite systems located in lower altitudes can cover unserved or underserved areas and can complement traditional geostationary orbit satellites (GEOs) already being used by the Philippine government for internet connection.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;So, because they are closer in proximity to earth, they entail shorter return trip time of the signal and therefore there is a latency or delay that is significantly less. So, because it&rsquo;s significantly less, it can better support delay-sensitive applications such as video teleconferencing like this one,&rdquo; Bantigue added, referring to the virtual presser.</p>
			<p>For example, based on PhilSA&rsquo;s calculations, Elon Musk&rsquo;s Starlink has 99.1% total availability or satellites passing over.</p>
			<p>This means that for areas like Tawi-Tawi, that could mean &ldquo;23.98 hours of 24 hours in a day&rdquo; satellite availability. This depends on the results of PhilSA&rsquo;s tests, if it can determine that this would translate to actual internet connectivity.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;INCENTIVISE will help us assess their performance in the Philippines and determine their performance in the local setting or under local conditions,&rdquo; Bantigue explained.</p>
			<p>The project can also further transfer technology and open opportunities for the Philippines to be part of the space technology&rsquo;s &ldquo;supply chain&quot; since these satellites need to be replaced more often, she said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We can pursue further discussions or negotiations on capacity building through know-how transfer and retention and even local design and manufacturing which promote local SSDA industry development.&quot;</p>
			<p>Philippine Space Agency aims to foster local space era opportunities</p>
			<p>PhilSA is now accepting proposals until the end of this month and will take evaluate and decide which satellite internet operators will be assigned to certain sites for trials.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;While the tests are ongoing, we will also be conducting the assessment and preparing the reports, which we intend to complete and present and share with relevant government agencies by early quarter two of 2022,&rdquo; Bantigue said.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://news.satnews.com/2021/10/11/mu-space-unveils-new-smallsat-debuts-space-factory-2/?mohide=true&amp;mc_cid=fdc0124901&amp;mc_eid=e80892f101<br>
			</p>
			<p>mu Space Corp. has announced and displayed to the public their brand-new satellite, the mu-B200, and the opening of Factory 2 in Bangkok, Thailand, at the company&rsquo;s Satellite Tech Unveil 2021 event.<br>
				The mu Space Satellite Tech Unveil 2021 event.</p>
			<p>Factory 2 is the company&rsquo;s third factory to date and aims to cement the Southeast Asian company as an aerospace leader. mu Space Corp is an aerospace manufacturer and satellite internet service provider and the organization emphasizes the importance of a vertical-integrated approach. The company designs, builds and test in-house all their products in order to improve performance and quality, while reducing the additional costs of an extensive supply chain.</p>
			<p>The opening of the new factory and announcement of the mu-B200 is significant in that this will enable mu Space to triple their efforts in leading Thailand into the global space race. In December of 2020, mu Space opened Factory 0 for research and technology prototypes. Less than a year later, Factory 1 was opened. The factory is designated for most of the manufacturing stages, development, tests, productions of entire satellites and components.</p>
			<p>Factory 2, unveiled via live stream at the Satellite Tech Unveil 2021 event, is considered an extension area that will enable the production of more satellites. This factory also focuses on producing electronic parts and power systems relating to mu Space&rsquo;s satellites. The organization researches, designs, builds and tests all its technology in-house.</p>
			<p>Founded in 2017 by James Yenbamroong, mu Space has conducted orbital microgravity experiments as part of Blue Origin&rsquo;s New Shephard rocket launches and plans to work alongside other commercial agencies, as well as conduct their own launches in the near future.</p>
			<p>With the production of a new satellite, the mu-B200 and the launch of a new factory, mu Space is making a statement regarding their work within the aerospace industry in 2021. The Satellite Tech Unveil 2021 event was all about announcing to the public, their followers and their investors what it takes to manufacture aerospace products. This was also an opportunity for the company to display the actual satellite on stage. The mu Space satellite is the latest satellite produced by mu Space and its team of leading engineers, proving the main talking point of this event.</p>
			<p>The satellite weighs 200 kilograms and comes with a 1.2 kW high-power system. The lightweight and high power is accomplished through the use of nanotechnologies in the manufacturing process. The mu-B200 satellite features krypton thrusters for orbit correction, a phased array antenna and a unique TRL-9 flight-proven high-power bus system.</p>
			<p>With global launch activity having increased by 39 percent over the last decade and the value of the global satellite industry rising rapidly and expected to be valued at $508 billion by 2024 according to the Global Satellite Industry Insights &amp; Forecast Report 2020, mu Space Corp&rsquo;s expansion into the market is a signal that Southeast Asia is accelerating its participation in the satellite industry. mu Space is backed by leading investors, including B.Grimm Joint Venture &#150; Thailand&rsquo;s private power generation industry, Majuven Fund and private business groups such as executives from the UCLA Foundation, among others.</p>
			<p>Speaking about mu Space&rsquo;s Factory 2 announcement, CEO and founder James Yenbamroong said, &ldquo;I remember the days when we only had one desk, now we have over 100 employees&#x2026; Factory 0 was made to produce 1 satellite, Factory 1 can produce 10 and the new Factory 2 will be able to produce 100 satellites &#x2026; we do all the production processes in-house as we are a vertically integrated company.&rdquo; He also talked in detail about the new satellite, saying, &ldquo;The focus of this satellite is high performance and high power, the higher the power the faster the internet connection.&rdquo;<br>

			</p>
			<p>The Esrange Space Center is located above the Arctic Circle</p>
			<p>Last week, The Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) reported that it had signed a loan agreement with the Nordic Investment Bank that will make possible the creation of the European Union&rsquo;s first satellite launch site. The new spaceport will enrich the Esrange Space Center, a Space technology research facility located near Kiruna, in the far north of Sweden.<br>
				That is sure to position Sweden as a pioneer in the space industry</p>
			<p>The loan, valued at 12 million euros, will go towards extensive modernization of the space centre, something that has already been going on since 2015. The new launching pad is expected to be quickly completed given that the aim is to launch the first satellite from there already in 2022.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This important milestone means that Sweden will become a launching state, offering the most modern ground technology possible to European and international satellite owners. This will be of great importance for future research, technology development and expanded international collaboration &#150; all to support sustainable development of life on Earth&rdquo;, explained Stefan Gardefjord, CEO of SSC.</p>
			<p>The project entails construction work for the new launch site, including integration halls for rockets and satellites, expansion of planned fuel plants, launch pads and surrounding technical ground systems as well as the development of technical support systems in Esrange's operational communication centre.</p>
			<p>The Esrange Space Center opened in 1966 and has been used since then to launch sub-orbital rockets and high-altitude balloons. Now, the SSC will be able to also launch satellites weighing up to 150 kilograms. With that, the state-owned corporation is hoping to tap into the growing space industry market, which has been underutilized according to experts.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;With more than 50 years of experience from launching rockets and balloons, Esrange Space Center is already one of the most active and versatile launch sites in the world. And with the new spaceport capability it will most likely become the first launch site on European mainland to provide a platform for space companies to develop their next-generation rocket technologies and launch their satellites&rdquo;, said Philip P&aring;hlsson, Project Manager for the New Esrange at SSC.<br>

			<p><b><i>Study: Lockdown streaming habits persist <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/10/12/study-lockdown-streaming-habits-persist/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Samsung Ads Europe reveals in its latest report on the Samsung Smart TV landscape, Behind The Screens, that streaming habits, accelerated by the pandemic, have become routine as consumers adjust to post-lockdown life.</p>
			<p>Samsung Ads Europe, the media and advertising division of Samsung Electronics, leveraged insights from millions of Samsung Smart TV devices across &lsquo;EU5&rsquo; countries: UK, Germany, France, Spain and Italy. Samsung Ads Smart TV viewer data is broadly representative of all TV users for each country, verified by Kantar ComTech TV data.</p>
			<p>Streaming stabilises its position</p>
			<p>In 2020, time spent streaming overtook linear TV minutes on Samsung Smart TVs in the UK. Whilst undoubtedly exacerbated by lockdown there is evidence that streaming is a habit set to stay within the Samsung Smart TV environment, despite the gap between streaming and linear narrowing since 2020. For H1 of 2021 in the UK, Samsung Smart TVs consumed 32 minutes extra per day of streamed content versus linear.</p>
			<p>The UK is leading the streaming trend in the EU5, consuming an average of 13 per cent less linear TV than Samsung Smart TVs in Germany, Italy, Spain and France.</p>
			<p>Summer of sport</p>
			<p>Linear still draws in the crowds for live sporting events. 2021&rsquo;s summer of sport with Euro 2020, Wimbledon and the Olympics, took linear to the top for the first time since March 2020. While we have seen this shift back to streaming in the months since, it&rsquo;s clear that British audiences still love to watch sporting TV together and on terrestrial TV.</p>
			<p>In fact, Samsung Smart TVs in the UK saw a 20 per cent jump in average hours spent watching linear in June. While streaming remains overall more popular on Samsung Smart TVs, there is still an appetite for linear around major live events.</p>
			<p>AVoD takes a leap</p>
			<p>SVoD has remained largely flat, growing steadily at 331 per cent year-on-year in terms of time spent viewing per TV. Meanwhile, AVoD has started to close the gap &#150; amassing a 150 per cent growth in the UK since January 2020. It now accounts for 50 minutes per day on Samsung Smart TVs in the UK.</p>
			<p>This reflects the growth of traditional AVoD services such as YouTube as well as the increasing popularity of FAST platforms such as Samsung TV Plus, which saw a 25 per cent year-on-year growth between Q3 2020 and Q3 2021.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;While we saw many changes in viewership over the past 18 months, many stakeholders within the CTV ecosystem awaited to see if those changes stuck,&rdquo; commented Alex Hole, Vice President of Samsung Ads Europe. &ldquo;The initial results are in and while linear still dominates for live TV, we can see that streaming has become an entrenched habit among Samsung Smart TVs in the UK. This means that keeping a close eye on where a given audience will be spending &#150; and splitting &#150; their total TV time is more critical than ever if advertisers wish to reach them in the right moments.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Australian made Binar-1 satellite deployed into Low Earth Orbit<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.manmonthly.com.au/news/australian-made-binar-1-satellite-deployed-low-earth-orbit/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Western Australia&rsquo;s homegrown spacecraft, Binar-1, has been deployed into Low Earth Orbit from the International Space Station (ISS), five weeks following its launch from Cape Canaveral in Florida. </p>
			<p>Curtin University&rsquo;s Space Science and Technology Centre (SSTC) staff and students watched a live feed on 6 October as Binar-1 was placed into the tiny airlock of the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo on the ISS and sent into space. </p>
			<p>Binar-1 is now on a journey to make first contact before testing critical systems, collecting data and taking photographs from 400km above Earth. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;The launch of WA&rsquo;s first homegrown spacecraft on the Space-X rocket was exciting, but this moment and the coming few days are the really crucial points for our Binar Space Program and the team of staff and students who designed and built Binar-1 from scratch,&rdquo; SSTC director Professor Phil Bland said. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t wait to hear Binar-1&rsquo;s &lsquo;first words&rsquo; from space &#150; that will be the time when we will be able to declare the success of our first space-mission and put us firmly on the path to proving that our technology can deliver. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;That contact and the protocol testing that follow will set us up to achieve our aim of sending six more satellites into space over the next 18 months, and our ultimate goal of taking WA to the Moon by 2025.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>With Binar-1 now safely in orbit, the team is focused on listening out for her &lsquo;heartbeat&rsquo;. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;We built Binar-1 to communicate using Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radio signals which is the backbone of an exciting opportunity to engage both the ham radio community and STEM students,&rdquo; Binar program manager Ben Hartig said. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;We have been collaborating with amateurs around the world and local school groups, so that they are also able to listen to Binar-1 as it passes overhead. With the right equipment and antenna, anyone can hear Binar-1 when it makes contact. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;But it will be our Curtin SSTC team who can decode the signal to tell us where Binar-1 is and how it is performing. The team will confirm all systems are working and then begin sending instructions for the next phase of its mission.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>The deployment was made possible through Curtin University&rsquo;s partnership with start-up Space BD Inc, which is the official service provider selected by JAXA, the Japanese Space Agency, in the area of ISS utilisation and satellite launch service. </p>
			<p>Testing the viability of Binar-1 in space, will be facilitated through Curtin&rsquo;s alliance with remote operations specialists, Fugro, and their Space Automation, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Control Complex (SpAARC). </p>
			<p>The Binar Space Program has been generously supported by a $500,000 state government to facilitate joint operations with the Fugro SpAARC facility, and advance a valuable outreach component to inspire young people in WA to pursue careers in STEM. It is also supported by the Australian Remote Operations for Space and Earth (AROSE) consortium. </p>
			<p>Binar-1 will orbit 400km above Earth&rsquo;s surface, about the distance from Perth to Albany, and circle the planet once every 90 minutes. Two small cameras on board will also capture images of WA&rsquo;s coastline. </p>
			<p>Western Australians can re-watch the Binar-1 launch by visiting the Big Binar at WA Museum Boola Bardip and writing a message to space until 11 October. </p>

			<p><b><i>Newly appointed 9Now boss to push for place on Smart TVs<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/business/companies/newly-appointed-9now-boss-to-push-for-place-on-smart-tvs-20211008-p58yg9.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>The newly appointed head of Nine Entertainment Co&rsquo;s advertising backed streaming service says he will push for a seat at the table with global manufacturers to ensure local broadcasters are given prominence above offshore services on smart televisions.</p>
			<p>Hamish Turner, who was previously Nine&rsquo;s program director, has been elevated to run 9Now, the company&rsquo;s broadcast video on demand platform which is viewed as a significant growth driver inside the company. Nine is also the owner of The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.</p>
			<p>Mr Turner said a key priority in the role will be ensuring 9Now is given the same prominence on smart TV home screens as global streaming products such as YouTube, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.<br>
			</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Decisions are being made in boardrooms in New York, not in the local markets and so we absolutely would like to be at the table,&rdquo; Mr Turner said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re really focused on this prominence and inclusion space that we&rsquo;re seeing in every market around the world - UK, Germany, France - where you&rsquo;re pushing the government to ensure the sanctity of the free-to-air players.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The so-called &lsquo;prominence&rsquo; of streaming apps on smart TV home screens has become one of the biggest regulatory issues for local television networks, which view advertising based streaming services as a key source of growth.</p>
			<p>Smart TVs - devices that allow people to watch television through an internet connection - are increasingly common in Australian households. A report by Integral Ad Science last year found eight in 10 consumers have access to a smart TV in their home and half of Australians prefer to stream video content on this device over mobile, desktop computers or tablets.</p>
			<p>But manufacturers like Samsung, Toshiba and Sony often have relationships with international tech and media companies like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video and strike global deals to feature their apps in favourable positions on their interfaces.</p>
			<p>In the UK, regulation is being introduced to manage this issue. The UK government last month renewed a licence for a digital terrestrial platform - known as Freeview - until 2034, a deal which ensure audiences can watch TV channels like ITV and BBC for free digitally for at least another decade. Local television lobby group Free TV is pushing for the creation of a regulatory framework that prevent local networks&rsquo; programming being swamped by shows from offshore streamers.</p>
			<p>Mr Turner said being able to find local applications through these devices was crucial to their growth, given almost 70 per cent of 9Now&rsquo;s live viewing was on a smart television and about 65 per cent of &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; viewing on 9Now was also conducted through smart TVs.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We need to continue to look at how we strengthen those relationships [with global manufacturers] and make good strategic calls on the people we want to back in. Android is emerging as a real monopoly in terms of the operating systems,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>Foxtel chief executive Patrick Delany says the group&rsquo;s strategy will continue to be a successful way to grow.</p>
			<p>Foxtel to launch smart TVs in new global deal</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What that leads to is the discussion we are having around prominence and ensuring that Australian content will continue to be seen now and in the future, and whether these big international conglomerates are the people deciding what you&rsquo;re going to watch moving forward. Ultimately, that will be what will happen if a commercial model emerges whereby they&rsquo;re deciding what you as a consumer should watch the type of revenue that they&rsquo;re going to get on the way through.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The comments come after Foxtel announced plans on Friday to license a Comcast&rsquo;s new smart TV - Sky Glass - in this market. The deal will allow Foxtel to sell the product and well as use its operating systems to integrate streaming services Kayo Sports, Binge and Flash onto the device.</p>
			<p>OzTAM data from January to September this year shows that Nine has the largest share of the online video on-demand space - 44.2 per cent. Seven has a share of 38.2 per cent and Ten&rsquo;s share is 17.6 per cent.</p>
			<p>Nine, which has requested viewers register some personal details before watching 9Now since its inception, has grown to more than 11 million signed-in users. Mr Turner said the future of online video services is tailoring the experience to the user - which also helps advertisers.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/10/08/cheng-set-to-acquire-hks-i-cable/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Henry Cheng, billionaire chairman of Hong Kong&rsquo;s New World Development, is set to become the controlling shareholder of the parent company of the region&rsquo;s broadband pay-TV operator i-Cable.</p>
			<p>Stock exchange filings indicate that Celestial Pioneer, a company wholly-owned by Cheng, reached two agreements with certain undisclosed minority shareholders of Forever Top (Asia) on September 30th conditionally to buy a 40.5 per cent interest in the i-Cable parent.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Upon completion of the sales and purchase agreements, Forever Top will become a controlled corporation of Celestial Pioneer and Dr Cheng Kar-shun,&rdquo; the exchange filing said.</p>
			<p>Together with an existing stake held by Celestial Pioneer, Cheng will own at least 72 per cent of Forever Top when the transaction completes.</p>
			<p>Forever Top assumed control of i-Cable in 2017 with a capital injection of more than HK$700 million (&euro;78m), after its previous owner, Wharf Holdings, chose no longer to fund the loss-making operator.</p>
			<p>It had 754,000 pay-TV subscribers as of June 2020, a 38 per cent share of the market.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.itnews.com.au/news/us-telecom-regulator-circulates-boeing-satellite-plan-for-approval-571052<br>
			</p>
			<p>Company wants to launch and operate 147 satellites.</p>
			<p>The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) disclosed it circulated Boeing's application seeking approval to launch and operate 147 satellites to provide broadband internet access for a vote.</p>
			<p>Boeing first filed with the FCC in 2017 seeking approval to deploy a V-band Constellation using low earth orbit and highly inclined non-geostationary orbit satellites &quot;to provide high speed broadband communications.&quot;</p>
			<p>Boeing sought to operate V-band Constellation &quot;to provide broadband Internet and communications services to residential consumers, governmental, and professional users across the United States, Puerto Rico, and US Virgin Islands.&quot;</p>
			<p>In 2019, Elon Musk's SpaceX urged the FCC to reject Boeing's plan saying it presented a &quot;clear danger of harmful interference&quot; to other systems or &quot;at a minimum impose appropriate conditions to ensure that Boeing&rsquo;s operations do not harm those of other&quot; operators.</p>
			<p>Boeing declined to comment on the FCC application circulated for a vote by Acting FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel.</p>
			<p>In April, the FCC voted to approve a SpaceX plan to deploy some Starlink satellites at a lower earth orbit than planned as part of its push to offer space-based broadband internet.</p>
			<p>SpaceX had asked the FCC for approval to fly 2824 satellites at a lower orbit as part of the plan to provide high-speed broadband internet services to people who currently lack access.</p>
			<p>The FCC also said SpaceX agreed to accept that their lower-altitude satellites may encounter interference from satellites deployed under Amazon's Kuiper Systems satellite project.</p>
			<p>In July, Amazon said it would invest more than US$10 billion to build a network of 3236 low-earth orbit satellites.</p>
			<p>SpaceX, which plans to eventually deploy 12,000 satellites in total, has said previously the Starlink constellation will cost it roughly US$10 billion.</p>
			<p>While extremely costly to deploy, satellite technology can provide high-speed internet for people who live in rural or hard-to-serve places where fibre optic cables and cell towers do not reach.</p>
			<p>The technology could also be a critical backstop when hurricanes or other natural disasters disrupt communication.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://news.satnews.com/2021/10/06/ready-to-launch-space-operations-new-zealand-is-launched/?mohide=true&amp;mc_cid=1b6fd162a0&amp;mc_eid=e80892f101<br>
			</p>
			<p>Great South&rsquo;s space operations business has grown to such an extent that on October 1, 2021 it became a stand-alone company, Space Operations New Zealand Ltd.</p>
			<p>This speaks well for the business that has undergone exponential growth in recent years with increasing demand from international small satellite companies for its commercial and civilian ground station services and launch support services at Awarua.</p>
			<p>Space Operations NZ CEO Robin McNeill said Awarua had gone from hosting 24 antennas before COVID- 19 hit, to 35 now, and by mid next year there would be 42 on site.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We will have at least five new antennas installed before the end of this year and we continue to field enquiries from companies in this rapidly growing global sector.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Space Operations NZ also owns its own antennas that are leased to satellite operators and is building another to keep up with demand. Additionally, Space Operations NZ provides downrange support for international launch companies, including Rocket Lab.</p>
			<p>Southland has had an active role in the space community since 2004 when the Awarua Satellite Ground Station was established in conjunction with the European and French Space Agencies.</p>
			<p>It is New Zealand&rsquo;s only commercial low Earth orbit satellite ground station, where data is downloaded from satellites and spacecraft are commanded.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Essentially, without us you&rsquo;ve got a flying brick,&rdquo; Mr. McNeill said.</p>
			<p>The satellites are used for all manner of purposes, including tracking shipping containers, measuring the atmosphere, imaging the Earth, calibrating satellite navigation systems and providing internet services.</p>
			<p>Future opportunities for Space Operations New Zealand include building further ground station sites in New Zealand and potentially internationally.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We have built an excellent international reputation and the longer we work with the space community, the more opportunities present themselves, so we&rsquo;re excited to now have more ability to develop the options and commercialize some of our research and development.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Southland is ideally located for satellite ground stations, given its proximity to the South Pole, flat land with excellent horizon sightlines and lack of radio interference.</p>
			<p>Space Operations NZ is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southland Regional Development Agency, a CCO trading as Great South.</p>
			<p>The company has its own office at 62 Deveron Street and now has five engineers on staff, including two postgraduate students from the University of Canterbury rocketry research group, which has had a close relationship with Great South.<br>

			<p><b><i>Foxtel enters smart TV market in global deal<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/foxtel-enters-smart-tv-market-in-global-deal-20211008-p58yc9<br>
			</p>
			<p>Foxtel is jumping into the smart TV market in a new global agreement with Comcast-owned Sky, designed to accelerate its streaming aggregation strategy.</p>
			<p>Foxtel is the first global syndication partner for Sky Glass, a smart television that will feature 4K TV and aggregate streaming content all in one place.</p>
			<p>Foxtel chief executive Patrick Delany says the group&rsquo;s deal with Comcast-owned Sky will help it &ldquo;be Australia&rsquo;s premium aggregator of streamed entertainment&rdquo;. Foxtel</p>
			<p>The product will be available in Britain from next month, but is not expected to be available in Australia until late 2023.</p>
			<p>Foxtel Group chief executive Patrick Delany pushed the deal as part of the company&rsquo;s repositioning &ldquo;to be Australia&rsquo;s premium aggregator of streamed entertainment&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are incredibly pleased to be the first syndication partner for Sky Glass. It allows us to join a global product and technology road map created by Sky and Comcast, offering customers a world-class entertainment experience and devices, powered by Comcast&rsquo;s global technology platform,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>The Foxtel Group has been aggressively pitching its future as a content supplier and content aggregator in a strategy designed to take advantage of a limited window of opportunity for a run at the ASX.</p>
			<p>Deloitte Australia has said a move towards bundling services is likely to be the next phase of the streaming wars, and will probably pull in players such as Foxtel, telcos and big media players such as Nine Entertainment, owner of The Australian Financial Review.</p>
			<p>&lsquo;Village square for video&rsquo;</p>
			<p>The iQ5 set-top box, which launched to select Foxtel subscribers early last month, is the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;start of the answer&rdquo; to the aggregation question and ties into the company&rsquo;s overall vision to be the &ldquo;village square for video&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>The partnership with Sky is the next part of the equation, effectively eliminating the need for a set-top box.</p>
			<p>The licensing deal, which will allow Foxtel to sell Sky Glass, also gives Foxtel access to Comcast&rsquo;s global media technology, which will help it establish itself as a streaming aggregation platform.</p>
			<p>Smart TVs that directly connect audiences with the internet and offer access to apps such as Netflix and TV catch-up providers are mainstream in Australia.</p>
			<p>According to figures from an Integral Ad Science report last year, eight in 10 consumers now have access to a smart TV in their home, and almost half of Australians prefer to stream video content on this device instead of mobile, desktop or tablets.<br>
				Free-to-air challenge</p>
			<p>The rise of the connected TV is both an opportunity and a challenge for free-to-air players such as Nine, Seven and Ten, and for subscription products such as Foxtel because the manufacturers control which services can be found.</p>
			<p>In May, Free TV, the industry lobby group of Australian metropolitan and regional free-to-air television, asked the government to make &ldquo;prominence requirements&rdquo; so that Australians can easily find and use free-to-air broadcast channels and on-demand services in a connected environment.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Increasingly, our TVs are computers, not simple sets, so we have to grapple with the fact that it is the manufacturer or the operating system that determines what services can be found,&rdquo; Free TV CEO Bridget Fair said at the time.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;And we have global players paying huge amounts for placement on TV remotes and home screens. If our free television services are harder to find, it&rsquo;s a big issue for a future sustainable business model.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The terms of the deal between Foxtel and Sky are unclear, but it is understood it is a non-binding memorandum of understanding rather than a binding contract.</p>
			<p>The announcement comes as Foxtel continues to pursue a limited window of opportunity &#150; while content agreements remain in place and subscription numbers are growing &#150; for a float on the ASX, expected for early next year.</p>
			<p>Patrick Delany has transformed Foxtel.</p>
			<p>Mr Delany and other key Foxtel executives, plus major shareholders News Corp and Telstra, appeared in front of investors last week to sell them on the company&rsquo;s narrative.</p>
			<p>Foxtel announced the launch of Flash, a news-focused streaming service to complement Kayo Sports and Binge, and spoke to its technology investments in the launch of the iQ5 set-top box.</p>
			<p>It laid down ambitious growth targets, including reaching 5 million subscribers across its portfolio, and increasing revenue to $3 billion.</p>
			<p>While the company pushed a growth story for its streaming products Binge and Kayo, its residential subscription numbers have declined by 250,000 year-on-year, with COVID-19 restrictions hurting its commercial business while pubs and clubs have been shut.</p>
			<p>Foxtel increased revenue by 10 per cent from $1.8 billion to $2 billion in the last financial year, as reported by News Corp in August.<br>

			<p><b><i>End of the satellite dish? Sky launches its own smart TV<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/07/end-satellite-dish-sky-glass-launch-smart-tv<br>
			</p>
			<div align="left">
				<p>Company says Sky Glass will be paid for &lsquo;like a mobile phone&rsquo; and removes need for dish or set-top box</p>
			</div>
			<p>Sky customers in the U.K will no longer need a satellite dish or set-top box.</p>
			<p>Sky has launched its own range of smart TVs, removing the need for customers to use a satellite dish or set-top box, as the pay-TV company shifts its offering to remain competitive in the streaming era.</p>
			<p>The broadband-powered TV set, called Sky Glass, will be be available to buy in the UK from 18 October and in Sky&rsquo;s other European markets next year. The new service will aggregate content from streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+, as well as Sky channels and content from other broadcasters.</p>
			<p>Dana Strong, the group chief executive at Sky, said: &ldquo;The streaming revolution and the explosion of content has brought a whole new set of challenges.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Sky Glass is the streaming TV with Sky inside. Most people use multiple apps to find the content they want. But the apps are not connected, and the experiences are fragmented. So we spend more time searching for content than enjoying it.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The TV aims to simplify the largest screen in the house by doing away with the need for multiple boxes, separate speakers and a mess of cables, while adding smartphone-like features.</p>
			<p>It detects your presence to wake when you walk in the room and responds to voice commands with &ldquo;Hello, Sky&rdquo;. It will learn from your family&rsquo;s watching habits to suggest appropriate content, even if it is within apps such as Netflix or from another device such as an Xbox. Software updates will give it new features, while a Zoom-capable video chat camera add-on is coming in spring 2022.</p>
			<p>It boasts an integrated Dolby Atmos surround sound system with six speakers, and promises to automatically adapt to the content being broadcast and ambient light in the room to offer the optimum speech and picture quality. The remote has also been simplified.</p>
			<p>Sky said Glass would cut electricity consumption by about 50% by doing away with multiple boxes, while it claims its recyclable, plastic-free packaging and off-setting make it be the first carbon-neutral TV.</p>
			<p>The launch of the TV service signals Sky&rsquo;s attempt to get ahead of the &ldquo;cord-cutting&rdquo; phenomenon in which tens of millions of US customers ditched their traditional pay-TV bundles of channels in favour of cheaper offerings from streaming services such as Netflix.</p>
			<p>Sky, which was acquired by the US pay-TV giant Comcast three years ago for &pound;30bn, said the new service would be competitively priced, with consumers able to pay for the TV as part of a monthly subscription.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You can now buy your TV just like you buy your mobile phone, with a range of flexible monthly payment options,&rdquo; she said.</p>
			<p>Monthly subscription packages will start at &pound;13 for the TV with the cheapest device and TV content package priced at &pound;39 a month.</p>
			<p>When the company launched its premium Sky Q box in 2017, it said it was working on an offering to make its full TV service available via a broadband connection, which would enable it to target 6m homes across Europe who do not have a satellite dish.</p>
			<p>In the UK, Sky offers the Now TV streaming platform, which allows consumers to buy monthly passes for access to entertainment and sports content, but it does not provide access to all Sky&rsquo;s services.<br>
			</p>
			<p>The cost of TV and streaming services</p>
			<p>Netflix: From &pound;5.99 a month to &pound;13.99 (excluding broadband)</p>
			<p>Amazon Prime Video: &pound;79 annually, &pound;6.58 a month</p>
			<p>Disney+: &pound;7.99 a month</p>
			<p>ITV&rsquo;s Britbox: &pound;5.99 a month</p>
			<p>Discovery+: &pound;4.99 a month</p>
			<p>Sky&rsquo;s Now TV: From &pound;9.99 a month to &pound;33.99 depending on package</p>
			<p>BT TV: From &pound;12 to &pound;40 a month</p>
			<p>Virgin Media TV: From &pound;5 to &pound;41 a month</p>

			<p><b><i>Ku-band tuned-up to play well in the Middle East<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.arabianaerospace.aero/ku-band-tuned-up-to-play-well-in-the-middle-east.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>Panasonic&rsquo;s Gen-3 in-flight connectivity is now available in Asia with the Middle East to follow.</p>
			<p>Increased connectivity: The third-generation Ku-band roll-out continues: Image: APSTAR-6D.</p>
			<p>Panasonic Avionics is continuing with the roll-out of its third-generation Ku-band communications network, which offers an improved airline and passenger experience.</p>
			<p>This includes faster internet, video streaming, VoIP applications, improved live TV picture quality and broader channel choice, 4G phone services, and greater bandwidth for crew applications.</p>
			<p>In March, its first extreme high-throughput satellite (XTS) entered service over the Asia-Pacific region. There are plans for another satellite launch to cover the Middle East region next year.</p>
			<p>The APSTAR-6D high-throughput satellite was launched last July and has a total capacity of 50 gigabits per second.</p>
			<p>It was jointly designed by APSATCOM and Panasonic Avionics, and provides airlines with multiple gigahertz of new Ku-band capacity over China and high-density routes around East Asia, including Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, using narrow XTS spot beams.</p>
			<p>In addition, APSTAR-6D provides high-throughput satellite (HTS) coverage over its full field of view, including the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Australia and the Southern Ocean down to Antarctica, which includes areas not served by any other HTS satellite.</p>
			<p>Plans are now well under way for the launch of a second XTS satellite that will provide enhanced connectivity over Europe and the Middle East.</p>
			<p>Built by Thales Alenia Space, Eutelsat 10B is due to launch on an Ariane 5 rocket from the Guiana Space Centre in early 2022. The satellite will be located at 10&deg; East, an orbital position that offers a unique visibility spanning from the Americas to Asia.</p>
			<p>Panasonic Avionics has signed a contract with Eutelsat Communications to enable it to provide multiple gigahertz of XTS Ku-band in-flight connectivity to airlines and their passengers flying over a wide area across Europe, the Mediterranean basin, Africa, the Middle East and the Indian Ocean.</p>
			<p>The satellite&rsquo;s HTS payloads will be able to process more than 50 GHz of bandwidth, offering a throughput of approximately 35 Gbps in total.</p>
			<p>All of the aircraft &#150; more than 2,500 &#150; flying with Panasonic&rsquo;s connectivity solutions have now been upgraded to its Gen-3 network.<br>
				Gen-3 is a combination of both new installed next-generation modems and new XTS and HTS that promise to boost both the speeds and bandwidth available while in flight.</p>
			<p>In addition to in-flight internet access, Panasonic Avionics offers live television with the world&rsquo;s only global live sports channels delivered in partnership with IMG. It also delivers real-time advertising and other transactions that open up a huge range of in-flight retail possibilities.</p>
			<p>The higher-speed Gen-3 network will also help enable Panasonic&rsquo;s ZeroTouch system, which moves content to and from an aircraft using Wi-Fi, 4G or a Ku-band satellite connection.</p>
			<p>ZeroTouch reduces an airline&rsquo;s need to physically touch the aircraft because all interactions are managed through a virtual dashboard.</p>
			<p>It provides access to real-time passenger data, software, and media, plus content updates can be data-driven, helping to create a relevant and personalised passenger experience.</p>
			<p>Ken Sain, chief executive officer of Panasonic Avionics Corporation, said: &ldquo;Our third-generation communications network delivers the targeted, flexible use of extreme high-throughput capacity, ensuring we can meet the needs of our airline customers with cost-effective and reliable high-bandwidth services well into the future.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Tailoring the capacity to areas of demand will provide our airline customers with better service, unprecedented coverage, and the ability to dramatically increase throughput. This opens the doors for airlines to further customise their connectivity offerings to meet the evolving expectations of their passengers.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Jeff Sare, the company&rsquo;s vice president, in-flight connectivity solutions added: &ldquo;We are committed to long-term investment in our high-bandwidth, global Ku-band network, and the service entry of APSTAR-6D is the latest step in that journey.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The company currently has equipment flying on Emirates, Turkish, Etihad, Qatar, Saudia, Egypt, Kuwait, Middle East Airlines-Air Liban, Saudi Gulf and several private operators.</p>
			<p>It has delivered more than 15,400 in-flight entertainment systems and 2,540 in-flight connectivity solutions to the world&rsquo;s leading airlines.<br>

				Hanoi (VNA) &#150; The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, JAXA, on October 7 morning suspended the launch of its fifth Epsilon solid-fuel rocket that is expected to carry nine small satellites, including Vietnam&rsquo;s NanoDragon.</p>
			<p>In its announcement, JAXA said the suspension was due to strong wind.</p>
			<p>On October 1 morning, JAXA also suspended the launch of the rocket some 19 seconds before the scheduled lift-off time.</p>
			<p>According to the agency, a glitch occurred at ground radar equipment that monitors the Epsilon-5's position and speed, located near the rocket's launching pad. It might cause a problem in tracking the rocket.</p>
			<p>The NanoDragon, a nano-layer cubesat satellite which weighs 3.8 kilograms, was developed by the Vietnam National Space Centre (VNSC) under the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology.</p>
			<p>The satellite was delivered to Japan and tested at the Uchinoura Space Centre in Kagoshima prefecture in August before being officially transferred to the JAXA for launching under the second &quot;Innovative satellite technology demonstration&quot; programme.<br>

			<p><b><i>Philippine Cube Satellites Officially Launched from International Space Station<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://opengovasia.com/philippine-cube-satellites-officially-launched-from-international-space-station/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The country&rsquo;s first university-built cube satellites (CubeSats), Maya-3 and Maya-4, were launched into space from the International Space Station (ISS) via Japan&rsquo;s Japanese Experiment (JEM) or &ldquo;Kibo&rdquo; Laboratory Module. The launch of the locally built cube satellites (CubeSats) to the International Space Station (ISS) &#150; the Maya-3 and Maya-4 &#150; is said to have been postponed due to inclement weather before the recent deployment attempt.</p>
			<p>The JEM Small Satellite Orbital Deployer (J-SSOD), along with satellite install cases containing CubeSats, was installed on the Multi-Purpose Experiment Platform (MPEP) by ISS crew members and passed through the Kibo airlock for retrieval, positioning, and implementation by the Japanese Experiment Module Remote Manipulator System (JEMRMS). The released CubeSats will move in an orbit similar to that of the space station, which is 400 kilometres in altitude.</p>
			<p>    This is a very historic and important day because the world has witnessed the deployment of the Maya-3 and Maya-4 cube satellites from the International Space Station to outer space. These two CubeSats are the first Philippine university-built cube satellites developed by Filipino scholars.</p>
			<p>    &#150; DOST secretary</p>
			<p>The most recent development follows the CubeSat&rsquo;s August launch to the space station aboard the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket&rsquo;s Dragon C208 as part of SpaceX Commercial Resupply Mission-23 (SpX-23). They were released alongside two other Australian CubeSats, Biner-1 and CUAVA-1, developed by Curtin University and the University of Sydney, respectively.</p>
			<p>The two CubeSats were established as a part of the STAMINA4Space Project&rsquo;s Space Science and Technology Proliferation through University Partnerships (STeP-UP), which is funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and implemented by the University of the Philippines Diliman (UPD) and the DOST Advanced Science and Technology Institute (DOST-ASTI).</p>
			<p>Maya-3 and Maya-4 were built by the first of two batches of STeP-UP scholars enrolled in the nanosatellite development track of the UPD Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute&rsquo;s Master of Science (MS)/Master of Engineering (MEng) programme (EEEI). The CubeSats are being developed in partnership with the Kyushu Institute of Technology (Kyutech) in Japan, with scholarship funding provided by the DOST-Science Education Institute (DOST-SEI).</p>
			<p>OpenGov Asia in an article reported that the CubeSats is said to be twice as heavy and larger than the Diwata-2 microsatellite, with more payloads and spectral bands, allowing it to support more image applications and satellite products. &ldquo;MULA is very significant to the DOST. Aside from being the biggest Philippine satellite developed, this is the first satellite that the DOST is doing in coordination with PhilSA,&rdquo; the DOST chief said.</p>
			<p>The DOST Secretary is convinced in PhilSA&rsquo;s ability to oversee the completion and expected launch of MULA, as well as manage and operate the satellite afterward. &ldquo;It gives me the pride to see first-hand how the DOST&rsquo;s early space R&amp;D (research and development) activities have helped capable young Filipino scientists and engineers,&rdquo; the official said, adding that the MULA team&rsquo;s dedication inspires him.</p>
			<p>Using the satellite, Filipino researchers could use MULA to mitigate challenges such as water quality and marine resource sustainability, among others. The MULA satellite in low earth orbit can circle the globe ten times per day, expanding opportunities for market data or leveraging collaboration with other nations.</p>
			<p>The Chancellor of the University of the Philippines Diliman (UPD) commented on the impact of this latest development on the youth. During the launch of the microsatellites Diwata-1 and Diwata-2, he noted that this project of building their satellites has the potential to inspire students and young children to pursue careers in space science and engineering. This will help many young and aspiring scientists overcome psychological barriers. The STeP-UP Batch 1 scholars explained that now that the satellites are in orbit, they can begin testing the various functions of the CubeSats.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/10/06/saudi-arabia-to-reportedly-lift-bein-ban/<br>
			</p>
			<p>beIN Sport&rsquo;s four and a half year-long ban in Saudi Arabia may be coming to an end.</p>
			<p>According to The Athletic, the Qatari broadcaster will no longer be barred from the country following an about-face from the Saudi kingdom. </p>
			<p>The end of the ban will mean that football matches from the English Premier League, UEFA, FIFA will be shown legally for the first time in Saudi Arabia for years.</p>
			<p>In a statement reported on by Reuters, beIN said that it had been approached by officials in Riyadh to settle legal cases. </p>
			<p>The Saudi government meanwhile is yet to comment on the reports. </p>
			<p>The broadcaster, which is the MENA region&rsquo;s primary sports rights holder, first filed a complaint with the WTO in 2018 alleging that the broadcaster was blocked. This was followed up by an international investment arbitration against the country totalling more than US$1 billion &#150; a figure which beIN said that it has now settled.</p>
			<p>In the intervening years, the Saudi government-sponsored piracy campaign beoutQ specifically targeted beIN and hijacked its feeds to broadcast illegally over the air in Saudi Arabia and internationally online.</p>
			<p>The agreement will see Saudi Arabia turn off beoutQ &#150; which the WTO had ruled was linked to the kingdom despite protestations of innocence. </p>
			<p>This comes months after beIN Sports began appearing on an irregular basis in Saudi Arabia, though its website was still blocked and its licence was not reinstated. </p>
			<p>The ban of beIN and the related piracy campaign were key factors that led the Premier League to block the takeover of Newcastle United by a consortium that was led by the Public Investment Fund (PIF) of Saudi Arabia. It remains to be seen whether the acquisition, which was abandoned last year, will be revisited by Saudi Arabia. <br>

			<p>Hiber abandons plans for IoT satellite constellation</p>
			<p>Hiber says two of the four satellites it has launched to date are no longer operation and the other two have suffered technical problems. Credit: Hiber</p>
			<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. &#151; Dutch company Hiber is dropping plans to deploy an internet-of-things smallsat constellation, electing instead to provide similar services through a third-party system.</p>
			<p>In a Sept. 24 letter to the Federal Communications Commission, the company said it was surrendering its market access authorization, effectively a license to provide communications services in the United States. It is also surrendering a license to operate 10,000 terminals that would have used those satellites.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Hiber will not be further developing its authorized satellite system and is currently in the process of surrendering its space system license to the Administration of the Netherlands,&rdquo; the company said in the filing.</p>
			<p>Hiber had been authorized to operate a 24-satellite system, with four launched to date. The first two launched in late 2018 as payloads on PSLV and Falcon 9 rideshare missions. A third launched on another Falcon 9 rideshare mission in January 2021 and the fourth as a secondary payload on a Soyuz-2 launch in March 2021.</p>
			<p>However, Hiber said in the filing that two of the four satellites are no longer operational. The other two, the company, have suffered technical issues that &ldquo;prevent Hiber from deploying its anticipated commercial service.&rdquo; The company didn&rsquo;t elaborate on those problems but stated that &ldquo;diagnosing and addressing the technical issues would be cost prohibitive.&rdquo; The company did not disclose which two of the four satellites were no longer operational and which two had encountered technical issues.</p>
			<p>A lack of operational satellites has kept the company from generating revenue, it said. In addition, the pandemic &ldquo;has been devastating to Hiber&rsquo;s ability to obtain additional investment to support construction of the remaining satellites&rdquo; because its executives in the Netherlands have been unable to travel to the United States to meet with potential investors.</p>
			<p>Hiber, though, did raise 26 million euros ($30 million) from the European Union&rsquo;s European Innovation Council Fund and private investors in March. The company said at the time that it was working on its &ldquo;in-house-developed satellite constellation&rdquo; for IoT services. &ldquo;The funds will be used to further expand the satellite network and grow its customer base,&rdquo; the company said in a March 30 statement.</p>
			<p>More recently, though, the company has called itself an &ldquo;industrial IoT as-a-service startup&rdquo; in statements, including one Sept. 13 announcing an agreement with energy company Shell to provide well monitoring services. Those services use &ldquo;satellite technology,&rdquo; the company said in a statement, but made no mention of Hiber&rsquo;s own satellites.</p>
			<p>Hiber said in its FCC filing that it is relying on other satellite networks to provide IoT services. &ldquo;Hiber has pivoted its business operations and intends to provide Internet-of-Things services through leased capacity on a third-party satellite network,&rdquo; the company stated. The company did not disclose that third-party network in the letter, or in a statement to SpaceNews.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Historically, we have provided IoT connectivity solutions through both our own satellites and third-party networks,&rdquo; Roel Jansen, chief executive of Hiber, said in the Oct. 6 statement. &ldquo;After reviewing our operations and our customers&rsquo; requirements, we have decided to discontinue our own satellite activities and deliver connectivity exclusively through best-in-class third-party providers.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Hiber acknowledged in its letter surrendering its license that it owes the FCC a default payment of $1.92 million, paid by a surety bond. The company asked the FCC to waive that payment, arguing it made a good-faith effort to deploy its satellite constellation, spending about 28 million euros in the process. If the FCC declined to waive the payment, Hiber asked that it be reduced by one third, reflecting the fact that it launched four satellites out of the minimum of 12 it needed to avoid the surety bond obligation.</p>
			<p>Hiber was among several startups planning smallsat constellations to provide IoT services, seeking a piece of what they believe is a growing market for device connectivity, particularly in remote locations not served by terrestrial networks.</p>
			<p>Others in the field are developing partnerships to provide service on other companies&rsquo; satellites in addition to launching their own satellites. Myriota, an Australian company offering IoT services by satellite, announced a partnership with Spire Global Sept. 22, where Myriota will use Spire&rsquo;s constellation of smallsats to expand its network. The deal, Myriota said, will allow it &ldquo;to quickly and cost-effectively scale its IoT services to meet rising global demand.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Hiber says two of the four satellites it has launched to date are no longer operation and the other two have suffered technical problems. <br>

			<p><b><i>Report: Will pandemic boost OTT take-up in Australia/NZ? <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/10/05/report-will-pandemic-speed-ott-take-up-in-australia-nz/<br>
			</p>
			<p>If historically the Australian and New Zealander pay-TV markets have mainly been counting DTH homes, things could significantly change in the next five years, predicts Dataxis. Similar to other regions of the world, the pandemic could have set the cat amongst the pigeons when it comes to cord-cutting and OTT adoption.<br>
				Despite being available for several years, OTT pay-TV offers have struggled to gain traction in Australia and New Zealand in the past. For instance, Foxtel Now and Kayo Sports, respectively the SVoD and the sports OTT pay-TV offers of Foxtel, the leading pay TV operator in Australia, only accounted for 10 per cent each of Foxtel&rsquo;s pay-TV mix in 2019. Eighteen months later, Kayo Sports alone accounts for almost 30 per cent of subscribers, while in the meantime DTH subscriptions, which accounted for two-thirds of the total, collapsed to 43 per cent of the mix.</p>
			<p>In fact, global streaming subscribers (Kayo Sports, BINGE, Foxtel Now) now account for more than 50 per cent of the Foxtel Group&rsquo;s total subscribers, according to News Corp CEO Robert Thomson, in June 2021.</p>
			<p>But Dataxis asked if we can expect this trend to last and accelerate in the coming years, and the answer is complex. In terms of figures, OTT subscriptions are indeed expected to overtake DTH by 2026. But in terms of content providers, only a few OTT pay-TV services offer skinny bundles or extensive pay-TV bouquets in the two countries.</p>
			<p>In this sense, Fetch TV, one of the early OTT players in Australia which started to provide an extensive TV offer, widely distributed among NBN providers and retailers, should have grown significantly over the last three years. But in reality, the OTT operator has struggled to win market shares, partially due to the high prices of its additional subscription packs. The OTT service finally diversified its app catalogue in order to become the broadest OTT library in the country. This aggregation strategy could prove successful for Fetch in the coming years, as Dataxis forecasts Fetch TV to account for 20 per cent of the Australian OTT market by 2026.</p>
			<p>In the end, DTH markets are expected to remain strong in Australia and New Zealand, respectively accounting for more than 40 per cent and 66 per cent of the total pay-TV subscriptions in the two countries.<br>

			<p><b><i>New small satellite platform debuts<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/New_small_satellite_platform_debuts_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>China is offering a small communication satellite platform to countries seeking an affordable solution for their own space-based internet networks.</p>
			<p>The DFH-3E satellite platform was designed by the China Academy of Space Technology, a subsidiary of the State-owned space conglomerate, China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. It is the country's first small satellite platform designed for operations in geostationary orbit, according to Xiong Xiaojiang, head of the platform's design team at the Beijing academy.</p>
			<p>A satellite platform is a framework used to assemble a satellite, or satellite system, in accordance with its role and function. It consists of the universal equipment needed by any satellite such as a power source, propulsion and orbital control devices, as well as instruments specifically designed for the satellite in question. This permits easy configuration.</p>
			<p>Xiong said satellites based on the electrically propelled DFH-3E platform will be able to carry up to 30 transponders and operate in a geostationary orbit for at least 15 years. With a weight of up to 1.8 metric tons, the satellite is tasked with establishing a space-based internet service and is designed to be lifted into orbit by a Long March 2C or 2D carrier rocket, he added.</p>
			<p>The designer noted that the first satellite based on the platform - APSTAR-6E, owned by Hong Kong-based satellite operator, APT Satellite - will be launched before the end of 2022. It will provide broadband internet services to Southeast Asian nations.</p>
			<p>&quot;We noticed that an increasing number of developing countries now seek to own communication satellites, but often don't have the money or the market demand and also can't obtain suitable signal frequency resources for communication satellites. So they don't need large, high-capacity satellites that are overly large or too expensive. The DFH-3E platform is affordable and can meet their needs,&quot; said Hu Zhongmin, chairman of China Great Wall Industry, the international trade arm of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp.</p>
			<p>&quot;This platform is also an ideal option for communication service companies to conduct trial runs for new business models, or to expand their networks. Any new business venture or expansion is prone to greater risk than established businesses. Buying and operating a small satellite comes with a smaller financial burden and greater flexibility, and helps operators reduce uncertainties,&quot; he added.</p>
			<p>Fu Zhiheng, president of China Great Wall Industry, said his company has signed a letter of procurement intent for one of the new DFH-3E-based satellites with the China Academy of Space Technology and APT Mobile SatCom.</p>
			<p>It will be operated by APT Mobile SatCom, a joint venture with APT Satellite headquartered in Shenzhen, to provide internet services to nations in Asia, Europe and Africa, he noted.</p>
			<p>All of them made their remarks on the sidelines of the 13th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition which concluded on Sunday in Zhuhai, Guangdong province.</p>
			<p>The biennial exhibition, popularly known as the Zhuhai Airshow, was originally scheduled for November last year, but was postponed due to the impact of COVID-19. More than 700 enterprises from nearly 40 countries and regions took part this year, according to the event's organizing committee.<br>

			<p>The Philippines continues to make its mark in space as the country&rsquo;s two cube satellites are scheduled to be deployed into space on Wednesday, Oct. 6.</p>
			<p>The Maya 3 and 4, the country&rsquo;s first university-built satellites developed by Filipino engineers and scientists, will be released from the International Space Station (ISS) at 5:15 p.m. (Manila time).</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Once the CubeSats are released from the ISS, the ground team will be able to prepare for its operations,&rdquo; the Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA) said.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Made in Vietnam&rdquo; NanoDragon satellite is scheduled to be launched into orbit on October 7, announced Assoc. Prof., Dr. Pham Anh Tuan, General Director of the Vietnam National Space Centre (VNSC) under the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology.</p>
			<p>The launch is slated to take place from 7:51.21 am to 7:55.16 am (Hanoi time), according to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).</p>
			<p>The solid-fuel Epsilon 5 rocket, expected to carry the NanoDragon satellite and eight others into the outer space, will be launched from JAXA&rsquo;s Uchinoura Space Centre in the town of Kimotsuki in south-western Kagoshima prefecture of Japan.</p>
			<p>JAXA on October 1 morning suspended the launch of the rocket some 19 seconds before the scheduled lift-off time.</p>
			<p>According to the agency, a glitch occurred at ground radar equipment that monitors the Epsilon-5's position and speed, located near the rocket's launching pad. It might cause a problem in tracking the rocket, JAXA added.</p>
			<p>The NanoDragon, a nano-layer cubesat satellite which weighs 3.8 kilogrammes, was developed by the VNSC.</p>
			<p>The satellite was delivered to Japan and tested at the Uchinoura Space Centre in Kagoshima prefecture in August before being officially transferred to the JAXA for launching under the second &quot;Innovative satellite technology demonstration&quot; programme.<br>

			</p>
			<p>The combined use of Al Yah 4 and Al Yah 5 with Al Yah 1 and Al Yah 2, which are expected to continue in parallel for several years, is expected to have a positive impact on Yahsat&rsquo;s future growth and secure the longer-term financial outlook. &#151; Supplied photo</p>
			<p>The Abu Dhabi-listed company has been appointed to complete detailed analysis, assessment and recommendation for 2 new satellites, which would be targeted for launch in 2026</p>
			<p>Al Yah Satellite Communications Company (Yahsat) on Tuesday announced that it has been formally requested to perform a thorough study in order to support a contract to augment the capacity already provided to the UAE Government on its existing satellites, Al Yah 1 and Al Yah 2, with two potential additional satellites, Al Yah 4 and Al Yah 5.</p>
			<p>The new anticipated capacity would augment the secure high-throughput capacity currently contracted on Al Yah 1 and Al Yah 2 with new coverage, capabilities and capacity to meet the next-generation demands of this key customer, according to the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange-listed company.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The combined use of Al Yah 4 and Al Yah 5 with Al Yah 1 and Al Yah 2, which are expected to continue in parallel for several years, is expected to have a positive impact on Yahsat&rsquo;s future growth and secure the longer-term financial outlook,&rdquo; the UAE&rsquo;s flagship satellite solutions provider said.</p>
			<p>Yahsat will pursue an RFP process to identify satellite vendors that offer the best technical and commercial solution to manufacture two geostationary satellites for a prospective launch by 2026 and make a recommendation to the UAE Government.</p>
			<p>Any such agreement would further add to the group&rsquo;s already significant contracted backlog, which stands out significantly from its industry peers at over five times current annual revenues, and underpins Yahsat&rsquo;s strong balance sheet, cash flow and low leverage position. These factors together form the right financial conditions to pursue such programs to create long-term shareholder value in parallel to delivering dividends.</p>
			<p>Ali Al Hashemi, group chief executive officer at Yahsat, said Yahsat has long been recognised as a strong national champion, a global ICT leader, and an enabler of critical communications infrastructure.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This potential expansion of our fleet for the UAE Government would further underpin our long-term contracted backlog and reinforces our position as the UAE&rsquo;s primary supplier and preferred partner to the UAE Government for advanced satellite communications and critical satellite connectivity needs.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We continuously strive to provide our customers and partners with best-in-class solutions and equipment. Today&rsquo;s announcement to assess the expansion of the existing fleet presents a significant opportunity to enhance Yahsat&rsquo;s business value for all stakeholders, allowing us to capitalise on our future growth strategy,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>Yahsat has a long-standing relationship with the UAE Government going back over a decade. The first satellite, Al Yah 1, launched in 2011 and the second satellite, Al Yah 2, launched in 2012, serve markets in the Middle East, Africa, Europe and Central and South West Asia.<br>

			<p><b><i>Connected Farms New Zealand Launch Innovative ZOLEO Device To Address Lone-Worker Safety Concerns.<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From Press Release<br>
			</p>
			<p>Connected Farms New Zealand Launch Innovative ZOLEO Device to Address Lone-Worker Safety Concerns.<br>
			</p>
			<p>In 2020, there were 22,796 farm-related injury claims accepted by ACC. That&rsquo;s over 60 incidents a day, taking a huge toll on farms, families, and the rural community whenever a farm worker is hurt on the job. Today, Connected Farms New Zealand is launching ZOLEO Satellite Communicator, a farm safety device designed to transform the way rural communities approach on-farm connectivity and safety. Now, tens of thousands of NZ farmers across all farm types can remain accessible, connected, and safe regardless of how isolated they are, with the ZOLEO device.</p>
			<p>Operating on the Iridium network, ZOLEO Satellite Communicator facilitates 2-way communication from anywhere including the highest, remotest high-country station. This multi-award winning product is easy and intuitive to use with a familiar messaging experience when integrated with smartphones, improving remote communications simply and effectively. This allows farmers and lone-workers to check-in to let others know they&rsquo;re ok, or get help quickly and easily, even outside of mobile phone range.</p>
			<p>ZOLEO offers peace of mind for family members and employers due to its ability for contacts to seamlessly and immediately reach each other via their ZOLEO number/email using the free app. ZOLEO provides farmers with reliable connectivity over satellite, mobile or Wi-Fi - improving lone worker safety. It's built with 24/7 SOS functionality for when things go wrong. This feature has the ability to alert first responders with a GPS location plus 2-way triage information can be messaged for integrated emergency services.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;When we are talking to Farmers about connectivity solutions over their land, the subject of lone worker safety always comes up.&rdquo; says Melissa Andrews, Country Manager at Connected Farms. &ldquo;Everyone knows someone who has been badly injured or even worse, has been out of range and unable to get help. Connected Farms have listened to these concerns and are delighted to bring remote communications to farmers with the ZOLEO Satellite Communicator.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Additionally, ZOLEO&rsquo;s durable profile case, belt fastener, small size, and light weight (only 150 grams) is ideal for all farming environments! With this device, the rural community not only improves lone-worker safety but, also acts as an important catalyst for reducing isolation to improve mental health and wellbeing - a growing priority across the rural sector.</p>
			<p>The ZOLEO device features a long-life rechargeable battery and integrates with the app which also provides accurate weather forecasts, so farm workers are never left in a sticky situation. Farmers can always count on reliable connectivity bringing reassurance to their families and communities, to help reduce on-farm accidents, as backup is only a message away.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;My son goes hunting on the remote areas of our farm and as a mum, ZOLEO brings me a tremendous sense of relief knowing he can send me a location drop along the way. I can message him back and he can alert emergency services if anything goes wrong.&rdquo; - Louise, Mackenzie high country farmer, and ZOLEO Satellite Communicator user.</p>
			<p>The ZOLEO Satellite Communicator is now available for purchase online at Connected Farm&rsquo;s website.</p>
			<p>Wherever farmers, family members or farm workers go, even to the most remote part of the farm or station, ZOLEO makes lone worker safety communications both simple and effective.<br>

			<p>Satellite company Starlink, led by world's one of the richest entrepreneurs Elon Musk, will focus on 10 rural Lok Sabha constituencies to provide internet services, according to a top company official.</p>
			<p>The company is also looking to hold virtual conversations with Members of Parliament, ministers and top government officials over the importance of broadband connectivity in changing lives in rural areas.</p>
			<p>The SpaceX's satellite broadband arm aims to start broadband service in India from December 2022, with 2 lakh active terminals subject to permission from the government.</p>
			<p>Starlink Country Director for India Sanjay Bhargava on Sunday said, &quot;In October I am also keen to have 30-minute virtual conversations with MPs, ministers, secretaries to GOI (government of India), or principal secretaries to states to see if they think 100 per cent broadband would help improve lives. We will probably focus on ten rural Lok Sabha constituencies for 80 per cent of the Starlink terminals shipped to India.&quot;</p>
			<p>In an earlier social media post, Bhargava had said that the pre-order from India has crossed 5,000 and the company was keen to work in rural areas for providing broadband services.</p>
			<p>However, he expressed uncertainty over the target number of terminals if the company does not get permission from the government to start satellite-based service in India.</p>
			<p>The company is charging a deposit of USD 99 or Rs 7,350 per customer and claims to deliver data speeds in the range of 50 to 150 megabit per second in beta stage.</p>
			<p>&quot;The number of pre-orders from rural constituencies will be one factor that helps us select focus constituencies,&quot; Bhargava said.</p>
			<p>The services of the company will compete with that of Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea in broadband and it will be a direct competitor to Bharti Group-backed OneWeb.</p>
			<p>In the post, Bhargava said that the company would be working with rural constituencies who were keen to have 100 per cent broadband.</p>
			<p>&quot;Most of this will be provided by terrestrial broadband, but the hard-to-serve areas will be handled by Satcom providers like Starlink. We look forward to the day a rural constituency in India can declare itself to be 100 per cent broadband,&quot; Bhargava said.</p>
			<p>Bharti-backed OneWeb, a satellite communications company, has plans to offer its services in India from May 2022.</p>
			<p>Telecom and satellite operators are in a dispute over spectrum allocation for mobile services particularly in frequency bands that are considered fit for 5G services.</p>
			<p>The Department of Telecom has sought views of telecom regulator Trai on spectrum allocation but the future of satellite-based broadband services is dependent on the method and process that the government will choose for the allocation of radiowaves.</p>
			<p>Satellite players do not want spectrum to be allocated to them through auction. Telecom operators have demanded for level playing in spectrum allocation as they get the radiowaves through auction only.</p>
			<p>In a pre-order note, Starlink said that its service is available in many countries and it will be easier for it to get government approvals if it has a high number of pre-orders from India.</p>
			<p>&quot;The government approval process is complex. So far there is no application pending with the government, so the ball is in our court to apply for consideration which we are working on. Our approach will be to get pilot approval quickly if pan India approval will take long.</p>
			<p>&quot;We are optimistic that we will get approval for a pilot programme or Pan India approval in the next few months,&quot; the note had said.<br>

			<p><b><i>Satellite Broadband More Affordable For Underserved Regions Of New Zealand<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From Press Release: Kacific<br>
			</p>
			<p>Easier setup, lower terminal and installation costs with high throughput ST Engineering iDirect MDM2010 IP Satellite Modem</p>
			<p>Kacific Broadband Satellites has reduced the total price of satellite broadband for New Zealander customers with the introduction of a new terminal kit. The full kit consists of a new, low power, high throughput ST Engineering iDirect MDM2010 IP Satellite modem, a paired iLNB 3210 transceiver and a smaller 75cm VSAT antenna.</p>
			<p>The MDM2010 is a 2-way, high throughput modem supporting a wide range of IP services like Internet/intranet access, VoIP and multi-casting services. Its easy point and play -installation and high-performance modulation techniques allow Kacific to offer fast broadband services more cost-effectively over its Ka-band network.</p>
			<p>The compact, lightweight modem is more affordable, easier to set up than existing modems, and can be configured from a web browser. It has a small profile, low power consumption and is suitable for all weather conditions.</p>
			<p>The introduction of the MDM2010 will reduce installation time and bring down the cost of the terminal kit by up to 50 percent[1], with entry prices starting from USD$440 for New Zealand.</p>
			<p>The new modem will easily connect 4 to 5 average users simultaneously, making it suitable for farms, households and small businesses.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The underlying principle of Kacific&rsquo;s business is providing fast affordable broadband to under-served areas,&rdquo; said Christian Patouraux, Kacific&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer. &ldquo;The MDM2010, is an step forward in delivering that. Along with its paired iLNB transceiver, it is an entry level product that will significantly lower the price of Kacific&rsquo;s consumer-oriented terminals without compromising performance. It is capable of speeds of up to 50Mbps down and 10Mbps up, further reinforcing the total cost-effectiveness of the Kacific broadband plans for consumer and SME end-users.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;There is nothing more satisfying for us at Kacific than to see videos of smiling first-time internet users accessing rich online content via a Kacific VSAT terminal. Every life that we and our ISPs and channel partners touch with internet connectivity represents a chance for a child, a family, a community, to have higher quality education and healthcare and be better integrated in a fast, connected world.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Lower costs will also give Kacific&rsquo;s partners flexibility to reduce the length of fixed term contracts where installation costs are included in monthly pricing.</p>
			<p>The new modems and terminals will roll out in New Zealand from 1 October 2021.</p>
			<p>New Gigstarter plans</p>
			<p>In conjunction with the introduction of the new modem Kacific has also introduced new plans for its popular Gigstarter service. Please refer to the local partners for local pricing at https://kacific.com/services/internet-for-business/</p>
			<p>[1] Relative to previous wholesale cost of dish, modem and transceiver kit. Total installation cost will also depend on travel and contractor costs. Installation costs may be amortised under a fixed term contract.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/09/30/ariane-6-launch-ready-8-years-late/<br>
			</p>
			<p>A major event took place in French Guiana when the launch complex for the upcoming Ariane 6 rockets was inaugurated. Dubbed ELA-4, the massive facility cost well over its budgeted &euro;600 million. The project is also some eight years late.</p>
			<p>The project was managed by the French national space agency CNES.</p>
			<p>The site is now handed over to Ariane for a series of tests in readiness for the launch in Q2/2022 for the maiden test flight of its Ariane 6 rocket.</p>
			<p>The CNES statistics are impressive and refer to some 55,000 cubic metres of concrete and 8,000 metres of structural steelwork and that some 75 per cent of the construction workers were locally hired.<br>

			<p><b><i>Planned launch of 9 Japanese satellites scrubbed late in countdown<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.space.com/nine-satellites-launch-japanese-rocket-epsilon-5<br>
			</p>
			<p>It's unclear when JAXA will try again.</p>
			<p>Update for 9 p.m. EDT on Sept. 30: Tonight's planned launch of the RAISE 2 satellite and rideshare payloads was scrubbed due to an apparent issue with a ground station. JAXA has not yet announced a new target date.</p>
			<p>Nine small satellites will launch to Earth orbit atop Japan's Epsilon rocket tonight (Sept. 30), and you can watch the action live.</p>
			<p>An Epsilon is scheduled to lift off from Japan's Uchinoura Space Center tonight during a 4-minute window that opens at 8:51 p.m. EDT (0051 GMT on Oct. 1). You can watch live at Space.com, courtesy of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or directly via JAXA. (FYI: JAXA's feed is in Japanese.)</p>
			<p>The Epsilon will haul to orbit for JAXA the Rapid Innovative Payload Demonstration Satellite 2, or RAISE 2 for short, and eight tagalong spacecraft.</p>
			<p>As its full name suggests, the 240-pound (110 kilograms) RAISE 2 is a technology demonstrator. The spacecraft, which was built by Mitsubishi Electric Corp., will test six different space technologies, including a small sensor called MARIN designed to gauge the position, altitude and velocity of orbiting satellites, JAXA officials said.</p>
			<p>The other eight satellites, which were manufactured by a variety of Japanese companies and universities, are even smaller than the 3.3-foot-wide (1 meter) RAISE 2. Four of the rideshare spacecraft weigh 8.8 pounds (4 kg) or less, and the other four tip the scales at between 101 pounds and 137 pounds (46 to 62 kg). (Those satellites will become weightless in orbit, of course, but they'll still have mass.) </p>
			<p>The heftiest of the tagalongs is DRUMS (&quot;Debris Removal Unprecedented Micro-satellite&quot;), a craft built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries. Once in orbit, the 2.75-foot-wide (84 centimeters) DRUMS will release a small object and then capture it, demonstrating tech that could eventually help humanity clean up space junk.</p>
			<p>This will be the fifth mission for the 78-foot-tall (24 m) Epsilon, which JAXA began developing in 2007. The solid-fueled rocket is capable of delivering to low Earth orbit payloads as heavy as 2,646 pounds (1,200 kg), according to its JAXA specifications page.<br>
				ayloads, huge benefits for space research</p>
			<p>The four previous Epsilon launches &#151; which took place in September 2013, December 2016, January 2018 and January 2019 &#151; were all successful. </p>
			<p>The 2019 launch lofted RAPIS 1 (&quot;Rapid Innovative Payload Demonstration Satellite 1&quot;), the primary payload on the first mission developed via JAXA's Innovative Satellite Technology Demonstration Program. RAISE 2 is the second mission in that program, which seeks to encourage the development of innovative space tech, especially by universities and the private sector.<br>

				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/09/30/pluto-tv-agrees-to-us3-5-million-fine-over-closed-captions/<br>
			</p>
			<p>ViacomCBS&rsquo;s ad-supported streaming platform Pluto TV has agreed to pay a US$3.5 million fine over closed captioning rules. </p>
			<p>The FCC announced that Pluto had also agreed to enter into a compliance plan to ensure that its programming includes closed captioning going forward.</p>
			<p>Pluto TV was found to be in violation of rules set out in the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010, which require operators to provide closed captioning on programming streaming over the internet if it had previously been shown on TV in the US with captions. </p>
			<p>The regulator first received complaints about Pluto TV&rsquo;s lack of subtitles in 2018 and ultimately decided that it was in violation. </p>
			<p>In a statement, the FCC said: &ldquo;The Investigation confirmed that Pluto had failed to comply with the IP Closed Captioning Rules when disseminating Video Programming on some Platforms. Even after being reminded of its closed captioning obligations, after filing the Petition for Waiver, after receiving the LOI and throughout the Investigation, Pluto continued to offer Pluto TV on existing Platforms and initiated Pluto TV on several new Platforms without being in compliance with the IP Closed Captioning Rules. As a result of Pluto&rsquo;s actions, individuals with hearing disabilities were unable to access closed captioning when viewing Pluto TV over some Platforms.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Responding to the fine, a spokesperson for Pluto TV said: &ldquo;We recognize the importance of closed captioning and have been working in close collaboration with the FCC on the consent decree. Pluto TV&rsquo;s mission, since its onset, has been to entertain the planet. We are committed to ensuring that our audiences can freely enjoy the programming streaming on our platform with ease of use and accessibility.&rdquo;<br>

			</p>
			<p>International companies tracking their satellites are using the satellite ground station in Awarua.</p>
			<p>But now the site is growing so fast, it&rsquo;s now a registered company and a multimillion-dollar business.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;[I&rsquo;m] pretty excited, actually rather a lot excited,&rdquo; Robin McNeill from Space Operations NZ said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are purely civilian and commercial so it&rsquo;s everything from high-speed internet to low-speed internet... We've got some customers who are tracking containers [and] we've got others who are imaging the Earth every day.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The site monitors satellites in low orbit roughly 600 kilometres away.</p>
			<p>It started out small 15 years ago, with just one dish for the European and French space agencies after being gifted to regional development and tourism organisation Venture Southland, now Great South, in 2008.</p>
			<p>Since then, its list of clients is growing and its revenue has doubled year-on-year.</p>
			<p>Just before the Covid-19 outbreak, there were more than 24 antennae, which ballooned to 35 in just over a year. More are expected by Christmas.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We've got three really big ones to go in in the next month and another two before Christmas that depends on shipping to New Zealand, and a few more next year - and we've got negotiations for even more,&rdquo; McNeill said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We'll have to buy some more land soon, I think.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The station's vital for US data and weather forecasting company Spire.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;When they pass over New Zealand, we get the data very quickly. If we didn't have that station, we would have to wait for the satellite to pass over another ground station and that could be 20 or 30 minutes later ... 20 or 30 minutes means a big deal in weather forecasting,&rdquo; said Dallas Masters.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It means that data can flow into weather forecasting systems and can improve those weather models.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s important too for our own space export Rocket Lab, which relies on the site to keep track of its launches.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;If you haven't got communications then you don't know what you've got. So, it's always a very, very tense moment when your spacecraft or rocket goes into the dark and comes back an hour later and it's either there or it's not there,&rdquo; chief executive Peter Beck said.</p>
			<p>The space industry globally is worth around $460.40 billion and expected to be $1 trillion by 2030.</p>
			<p>Places like Southland playing a major part in that growth.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;That tracking station is quite a little gem for the whole of the space industry. It's a very unique location, there's not many places on the planet where you can get elevations in the Southern Hemisphere like that,&rdquo; McNeill said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I struggle to sleep at night thinking about the great things we can do.&rdquo; </p>

				From https://www.adnews.com.au/news/foxtel-to-go-full-streaming<br>
			</p>
			<p>Foxtel, in a strategy update, confirmed that growth will be driven by streaming content, currently through Kayo Sports, BINGE and live news aggregation streaming service, Flash.</p>
			<p>The company also revealed a transition to streaming for Foxtel Retail following the recent launch of the iQ5 plug and play IP set top box.</p>
			<p>This transition includes a future as a streaming aggregator of Foxtel&rsquo;s content along with integrating a broad range of local and global streaming apps.</p>
			<p>The company plans a software update later this year which will allow the iQ4 set top box to be IP-only, without the need for satellite.</p>
			<p>Foxtel's three-year plan:</p>
			<p>     5 million plus subscribers, having reached four million total subscribers in the year to June, one million higher in the past 12 months.<br>
				    About $3 billion in revenue with continued opportunities for margin expansion, supported by streaming revenue growth, continuing to slow the decline in residential broadcast revenue and ongoing cost transformation through digital growth and operational efficiencies.</p>
			<p>CEO Patrick Delany: &ldquo;Our strategy briefing highlights today&rsquo;s Foxtel Group is a very different company to the one-product Foxtel of three or four years ago.</p>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.claimsjournal.com/news/national/2021/09/29/306217.htm<br>
			</p>
			<p>LOS ANGELES (AP) &#151; The latest in a series of U.S. satellites that has recorded human and natural impacts on Earth&rsquo;s surface for decades was launched into orbit from California on Monday to ensure continued observations in the era of climate change.</p>
			<p>Landsat 9 was carried into space aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket that lifted off from foggy Vandenberg Space Force Base at 11:12 a.m. The satellite successfully separated from the rocket&rsquo;s upper stage more than an hour later.</p>
			<p>A project of NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey, Landsat 9 will work in tandem with a predecessor, Landsat 8, to extend a nearly 50-year record of land and coastal region observations that began with the launch of the first Landsat in 1972.</p>
			<p>Landsat 9 will take the orbital track of Landsat 7, which will be decommissioned.</p>
			<p>Landsat 9 carries an imaging sensor that will record visible and other portions of the spectrum. It also has a thermal sensor to measure surface temperatures.</p>
			<p>Capturing changes in the planet&rsquo;s landscape ranging from the growth of cities to the movements of glaciers, the Landsat program is the longest continuous record of Earth observation from space, according to NASA.</p>
			<p>Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, who went to Vandenberg to see the launch, said the Landsat program provides &ldquo;a rich form of data&rdquo; that helps people&rsquo;s everyday lives and is vital in dealing with climate change.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the thick of the climate crisis right now, we see that every day _ drought, wildfires, hurricanes, Hurricane Ida that devastated parts of the South and went all the way up to New England,&rdquo; Haaland said during a NASA TV interview.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Images like the ones that Landsat 9 will bring back to us will help us tremendously to guide us in how we are approaching climate change, working to make sure that we can make the best decisions possible, so that folks have water into the future, that we can grow our food into the future,&rdquo; Haaland said.</p>
			<p>The Landsat program has amassed over 9 million multispectral images of Earth&rsquo;s land and coastal regions, according to Jeff Masek, Landsat 9 project scientist at NASA&rsquo;s Goddard Space Flight Center.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Using this record we can really document and understand the changes that have occurred to the land environment over this period from human activities as well as natural events,&rdquo; he said at a prelaunch briefing.</p>
			<p>The information has a wide array of uses in understanding and managing Earth&rsquo;s resources.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Landsat is our best source for understanding rates of tropical deforestation &#x2026; as well as other forest dynamics like disturbances from hurricanes, wildfires, insect outbreaks, as well as the recovery of those disturbances over time,&rdquo; Masek said.</p>
			<p>Landsat is also crucial for monitoring agriculture and food security, he said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We can pinpoint the types of crops that are growing on every field in the U.S. and worldwide,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We can also look at the consumption of water by crops.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Landsat 9&rsquo;s liftoff was the 2,000th launch from Vandenberg since 1958. Located on the Pacific coast northwest of Los Angeles, its position is ideal for testing ballistic missiles and putting satellites into polar orbit.</p>
			<p>French telecoms billionaire makes unsolicited approach for commercial satellite operator</p>
			<p>From https://www.ft.com/content/f928a4af-6e45-4536-8802-64fe7a27c55a</p>
			<p>Paris-based satellite operator Eutelsat has turned down an unsolicited takeover offer from French telecoms billionaire Patrick Drahi.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The relevant governance bodies of Eutelsat Communications have unanimously decided not to engage in discussions based on the terms of this proposal,&rdquo; the company said on Wednesday.</p>
			<p>Reuters, which first reported Drahi&rsquo;s interest, said Eutelsat, one of the world&rsquo;s leading commercial satellite operators, viewed the price submitted as too low.</p>
			<p>Drahi offered to pay roughly &euro;12 per share for Eutelsat, according to a person familiar with the matter. That compares with its share price of &euro;10.35 at the close of trading in Paris on Wednesday, giving it a market capitalisation of &euro;2.4bn.</p>
			<p>The bid comes only months after Drahi, who own telecoms and cable assets in France and the US and auction house Sotheby&rsquo;s, took a 12.1 per cent stake in BT, making it the British company&rsquo;s biggest shareholder. That deal had marked the tycoon&rsquo;s return to dealmaking after an interlude of several years on the acquisition front. He also took his European telecoms company private last year.</p>
			<p>Eutelsat competes with Luxembourg-based SES and UK-based Intelsat and operates 36 satellites over Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The company, which is 20 per cent owned by the French state, sells capacity to broadcasters, delivers broadband services and provides connectivity to aeroplanes and ships.</p>
			<p>A move into satellite services would be a departure for Patrick Drahi &copy; REUTERS</p>
			<p>Eutelsat shares are trading at all-time lows after five years of declining revenue and narrowing profit. In April, it bought a 24 per cent stake in OneWeb, the space-based internet pioneer, for $550m in a significant expansion bet.</p>
			<p>Analyst have predicted a period of consolidation in the satellite sector as traditional sources of revenue such as TV broadcasting shrink, and new competitors like Elon Musk&rsquo;s SpaceX seek to build new, cheaper satellite networks closer to Earth.</p>
			<p>But a move into satellite services would be a departure for Drahi because there would be few synergies with his telecoms and cable assets.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It is impossible to say with any conviction why Eutelsat would be of interest to Patrick Drahi at this point,&rdquo; wrote Jefferies analysts in a note. &ldquo;In our view, Eutelsat has been in value territory for some time, but its candidacy for acquisition was far better suited to in-market consolidation.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.startupdaily.net/2021/09/adelaide-nano-satellite-statup-myriota-lands-5-5-million-government-defence-contract/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Internet of Things (IoT) satellite company Myriota has landed a $5.48 million contract from the Australian government for Defence tracking communications.</p>
			<p>Myriota will use its network of nano-satellites to retrieve data from sensors across hundreds of Defence platforms, forming a global, space-enabled communications network.</p>
			<p>The network, dubbed the &lsquo;Internet of Military Things&rsquo;, could deliver increased operational efficiency, safety, and reliability.</p>
			<p>Minister for Defence Industry Melissa Price said the contract, through the Defence Innovation Hub, would contribute to growing a robust, resilient and innovative industrial base for space technologies in Australia.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Sovereign, space-enabled capabilities are critical to the future of Defence,&rdquo; she said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This innovation could enable the secure transfer of Defence data from almost anywhere on Earth.</p>
			<p>The contract follows Myriota&rsquo;s successful engagement with Defence&rsquo;s Next Generation Technologies Fund, part of the integrated Defence innovation system.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This technology has the potential to be used beyond Defence, with potential impact across almost all sectors of the Australian economy,&rdquo; Minister Price said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;From mining to remote education, Myriota&rsquo;s secure satellite communications technologies will provide global connectivity.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The contract comes just a week after the spacetech startup signed a deal to improve its IoT nano-satellite network with US-listed satellite data company Spire Global.</p>
			<p>The partnership will expand Myriota&rsquo;s existing coverage in North America, Australia and New Zealand to other markets including Europe.</p>
			<p>Based at Lot 14 in Adelaide, the startup has launched seven nano-satellites into orbit, with the goal of having 44 above the earth by the end of 2022.</p>
			<p>Myriota launched in 2013 and counts former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull among its investors, along with Right Click Capital, super fund Hostplus and the CSIRO&rsquo;s VC arm, Main Sequence Ventures.</p>
			<p>Having already raised more than $50 million, including $28 million in a Series B in 2020, the company announced earlier this month, that insurer IAG had invested an undisclosed figure in the startup via its VC arm, IAG Firemark Ventures, to bring IoT to Australia&rsquo;s insurance sector.</p>
			<p>The company used Elon Musk&rsquo;s SpaceX to launch its first satellite in 2018 and its most recent nano-satellites with Rocket Lab earlier this year.</p>
			<p>Myriota has also teamed up with the South Australian government on a $6.5 million project using low-earth orbit satellites to improve data collection and monitoring for state emergency, environment, water monitoring and bushfire mitigation services. The SASAT1 Space Services Mission will support data collection from ground based sensors plus Earth observation imaging.<br>

			<p>10 BOLD moves to MPEG4... but if you can no longer watch it, here's what to do.</p>
			<p>10 BOLD recently updated to a High Definition MPEG4 channel with surround sound audio in capital cities around Australia.</p>
			<p>But the move means some older television screens may be unable to access the channel.</p>
			<p>10 advises:</p>
			<p>    If you have a modern television (less than approx. 5 years old) should not need to do anything. Your TV should automatically receive the new 10 BOLD service in HD.<br>
				    If you have an older televisions (up to approx. 9 years old), you may need to rescan your television to continue watching 10 BOLD in HD.<br>
				    If you have a very old televisions (over 9 years old), you may not be able to receive 10 BOLD after Thursday 23rd September. This is due to very old televisions not being equipped with MPEG4 capability.</p>
			<p>Note: If you can receive 10 HD on LCN 1 or LCN 15 then you will also be able to receive 10 BOLD in HD on LCN 12.</p>
			<p>10 advises if your TV is not compatible, the cheapest option is to purchase a set-top box that is HD compatible. There are a few brands available at $40 (and some around $34).</p>
			<p>It also supplied the following advice for Foxtel viewers:</p>
			<p>    Foxtel cable subscribers with a modern Foxtel STB (IQ series) will continue to receive 10 BOLD as before but now in HD.<br>
				    Foxtel cable subscribers with a very old Foxtel STB will not be able to receive 10 BOLD after Thursday 23rd September unless they upgrade their STB to a IQ series STB.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From http://www.ecns.cn/news/sci-tech/2021-09-28/detail-iharmkpe0572365.shtml<br>
			</p>
			<p>China on Tuesday rolled out a small geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite platform, DFH-3E, at the ongoing 13th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition.</p>
			<p>Compatible with low-cost launch vehicles, the small GEO satellites based on the DFH-3E platform are targeting the market of small and medium-sized communication satellites with low capital expenditure.</p>
			<p>Xiong Xiaojiang with the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, also technical director of the platform, said they have provided schemes and suggestions to users in many countries and regions and attracted considerable interest.</p>
			<p>The global market for satellites has seen changes in recent years, Xiong said. A growing number of small and medium-sized countries need their own communication satellites, but they usually have limited funds and demands.</p>
			<p>He noted that when satellite operators test new services or expand their services, they need small and medium-sized satellites to deal with the market uncertainty.</p>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/09/shiyan-10-fails-in-orbit-after-launch/<br>
			</p>
			<p>China launched the Shiyan-10 satellite on a Long March 3B/E rocket at 8:20 UTC on September 27, lifting off from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center. The name and purpose of the payload were not confirmed before the launch, however, an object was cataloged in orbit a few hours after the launch, confirming it reached orbit.</p>
			<p>The payload was deployed into a 177 km by 40,104 km geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) with an inclination of 51.04 degrees. It was later confirmed that the payload of this launch was Shiyan-10, which experienced abnormal operating conditions during launch and was declared a failure. The Long March 3B launch vehicle was confirmed to have performed normally during the launch.</p>
			<p>Shiyan Weixing spacecraft are technology test satellites that are built by different providers as a pathfinder for new satellite technologies. The first Shiyan satellite was launched in April 2004 on a Long March 2C rocket. After that, eight more missions followed to test more experimental technologies.</p>
			<p>The last one was the Shiyan-9 payload, which launched on a Long March 7A (also known as Chang Zheng 7A) in March 2021 to a geostationary orbit (GEO). While the true function of this satellite was never revealed, it is speculated that it is used to perform high-resolution and high orbit optical remote sensing.</p>
			<p>Long March 3B/E lifts off from LC-2 at Xichang with Shiyan-10</p>
			<p>The Long March 3B/E is the upscaled version of the smaller 3B variant The 3B/E features an upgrade to the first stage and the liquid rocket boosters, which results in an increased payload capacity of the rocket to GTO and GEO. It can launch up to 11,500 kg to LEO and 5,500 kg to GTO.</p>
			<p>The majority of the 66 payloads that the rocket has launched so far had destinations of either GTO or GEO, with only a few rare exceptions in which it launched a payload into a Medium Earth Orbit (MEO). Most of the payloads are communications and telecommunications satellites, which usually require the orbits Long March 3B is built for.</p>
			<p>Since 2007, the 3B/E has flown 64 missions successfully, which is a record for the Long March rocket family. Its first launch was NigComSat-1, a Nigerian communication satellite. After that, Long March 3B/E only had one partial failure and one complete failure.</p>
			<p>During the launch of the Chinasat 9A mission in June 2017, the Reaction Control System (RCS) of the rocket stopped working during the coast phase, which resulted in a sub-planned payload release. The satellite, however, used its onboard propulsion to reach the desired orbit even with the rocket underperforming.</p>
			<p>The last, and only complete failure, occurred during the Palapa-N1 launch in April 2020, in which the third stage failed to ignite and the satellite failed to reach orbit, resulting in a complete loss of payload.</p>
			<p>The medium-lift vehicle is 56 meters tall with a liftoff mass of 458,970 kg. It is built by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology and consists of three stages, with the option to include a fourth stage as a kick stage.</p>
			<p>The first stage of the rocket stands 24.76 meters tall with a diameter of 3.35 meters. It uses a cluster of four YF-20C engines which are called YF-21C in this bundled configuration. At liftoff, they provide 2961.6 kN of thrust with a specific impulse of 260.69 seconds.</p>
			<p>The hypergolic engines on the Long March 3B/E ignite and Shiyan-10 lifts off from LC-2 at Xichang</p>
			<p>The engines use the hypergolic combination of dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) and dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) as propellants, which burn when they contact each other. This hypergolic mix is used on the first, second, and optional fourth stage of the Long March 3B/E as well as the four liquid rocket boosters.</p>
			<p>These four side boosters have a height of 16.1 meters with a slightly smaller diameter of 2.25 meters. They use a single YF-25 engine each, which is just the booster engine name for the YF-20C that the center core uses as well. Together with the center core, the rocket reaches a liftoff thrust of 5923,2 kN with all eight YF-20Cs igniting at launch.</p>
			<p>After a bit more than two minutes into the flight, all four liquid rocket boosters are jettisoned from the main stage, leaving the center core. After that separates 18 seconds later, the second stage ignites and takes over. It is 12.92 meters in length with the same diameter as the first stage and uses a single YF-22E engine. This engine provides up to 742 kN of thrust with the four YF-23F vernier engines to steer the rocket during the operation of the second stage.</p>
			<p>Shortly after the second stage is depleted, the third stage ignites with its two YF-75 engines. The stage has a length of 12.38 meters and stores liquid hydrogen and oxygen as fuel for the two engines. This stage can be shut down and started multiple times to reach the desired GTO or GEO orbit. Each of the engines provides 78.45 kN of thrust at a high specific impulse of 438 seconds.</p>
			<p>At last, there is an optional Yuanzheng-1 fourth stage. It is a kick stage that can provide up to 6.5 kN of thrust with its YF-50D engine, and was last used on the BeiDou-3 M19/20 mission in December 2019. However, it was not used with this launch.</p>
			<p>This launch was conducted from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center, in the southern part of China. It started operations in 1984 and since then has hosted a variety of Chinese rockets, including every launch of the Long March 3B family. The launch complex that was used in this launch was LC-2, which is one of the three launch complexes at Xichang.<br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/09/28/onewebs-next-batch-arrives-preps-india-launch/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Satellite broadband operator OneWeb, flush with $1 billion of insurance cover on its remaining 10 launches, is readying its business plans.</p>
			<p>The operator already has 322 satellites in orbit out of its full constellation target of 648 craft and the latest batch of 36 satellites are being prepared by Arianespace for launch next month having arrived at Ignatievo Airport in Russia from their construction facility in Florida.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Bharti, a major investor in OneWeb, is busy building two ground-based gateways in order to connect with the overhead satellites. OneWeb is aiming for a service introduction in India by mid-2022.</p>
			<p>However, OneWeb &#150; and potential rival Telesat of Canada as well as Elon Musk&rsquo;s Starlink service &#150; need clarity from India&rsquo;s government on &lsquo;landing rights&rsquo; and how the administration sees a sharing of spectrum. Questions have been asked over the 28 GHz band which is being looked at by satellite operators as well as cellular players in India.</p>
			<p>Peng Zhao, heading APAC Government Affairs and Policy for OneWeb, told BusinessLine that India has created a new agency, IN-SPACe, to handle applications for capacity.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This 28Ghz band is the only one available to satellite operators at the moment and is a bitter fight between the two industries. The question is that whether mobile operators really need that band, while 26GHz and many other 5G bands are available; on the other hand, if this band is taken away from satellite players, it is very difficult to do business and provide connectivity to those needing it the most,&rdquo; commented Zhao.<br>

			<p><b><i>Chinese KZ-1A returns to flight and lofts new remote sensing satellite into orbit<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/09/kz-1a-returns-to-flight/<br>
			</p>
			<p>A Chinese Kuaizhou 1A (KZ-1A) rocket lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Inner Mongolia at 06:19 UTC on September 27, lofting a new high-resolution remote sensing satellite into orbit.</p>
			<p>The rocket lifted off from Site 95 at Jiuquan, marking the 14th flight of a KZ-1 series rocket. This was also the first KZ-1 launch since the Jilin-1 Gaofen-02C launch in September 2020, which ended in failure and the loss of its payload.</p>
			<p>China&rsquo;s KZ-1A rocket is manufactured by the ExPace Technology Corporation, an aerospace company owned by the Chinese government, based out of Wuhan in China&rsquo;s Hubei province. The rocket is capable of delivering payloads of up to 200 kg into a Sun-Synchronous Orbit, and therefore is mainly marketed as a small satellite launch vehicle. </p>
			<p>ExPace is also in charge of managing the launch, as it has been for all previous flights of the KZ-1A vehicle.</p>
			<p>The 20 meter long rocket utilizes four stages, the first three of which are solid-fueled. The first of the three solid fuel stages has a burn time of 65 seconds and an impulse of 2,352 N/kg. The second burns for 62 seconds with an impulse of 2,810 N/kg, followed by a third stage burn lasting 55 seconds with an impulse of 2,850N/kg.</p>
			<p>The fourth and final stage is powered by a liquid-fueled engine and serves as the orbital insertion stage.</p>
			<p>The most recent flight of a KZ-1A, which was intended to deliver the Jilin-1 Gaofen-02C satellite into orbit, ended in failure after &ldquo;abnormal performance&rdquo; was detected coming from the launch vehicle, following which the payload failed to enter its pre-set orbit. Today&rsquo;s launch serves as a return to flight, following an investigation into the cause of the failure on last year&rsquo;s flight.</p>
			<p>Jilin-1 Gaofen-02D, the 250 kg satellite carried into orbit on today&rsquo;s launch, is the fifth in the Jilin-1 Gaofen-2 series of remote sensing satellites. It is the third to successfully reach orbit following the failures of the previously mentioned Goafen-02C launch last September, and the failed launch of Gaofen-02E in July of the same year. </p>
			<p>The Gaofen-2 series of satellites are developed and built by the Chang Guang Satellite Technology Corporation, which specializes in the design and operation of remote sensing satellites for commercial use.</p>
			<p>Artists impression of a Jilin-1 Gaofen-02 spacecraft &#150; via Chang Guang Satellite Tech Company</p>
			<p>The spacecraft is believed to have an operational altitude of 535 km above the surface of Earth, and be able to obtain a static push-scan image with a full-color resolution better than 0.76 meters and a multi-spectral resolution better than 3.1 meters. Images are transmitted to the ground stations via digital transmission with a rate of 1.8Gbps. </p>
			<p>Gaofen-02D &#150; the fifth Gaofen-02 spacecraft &#150; joins multiple other types of Jilin-1 series remote sensing satellites in orbit, all of which were built by Chang Guang Satellite Technology. Other Jilin-1 satellites in orbit include the two Jilin-1 Kuanfu-01 series spacecraft, which focus on providing high definition video from orbit, and the single Jilin-1 Guangexe-A optical imaging satellite. Overall there are at least 16 currently operating Jilin-1 spacecraft in orbit. </p>
			<p>The company plans to have approximately 138 Jilin satellites in orbit by 2030. Altogether, these will perform 24/7 all-weather, full-spectrum acquisition segment data and a capability of observing any global arbitrary point with a 10-minute revisit capability. This will create the world&rsquo;s highest spatial resolution and time resolution space information products.</p>
			<p>Report: Free Wi-Fi coming to aircraft </p>
			<p>From https://advanced-television.com/2021/09/27/report-free-wi-fi-coming-to-aircraft/</p>
			<p>A report from Norther Sky Research (NSR) suggests that while the Inflight Connectivity (IFC) market has inevitably been hard hit by the Covid pandemic and the severe cancellation of air traffic, both for business and holiday journeys, recovery is now taking place.</p>
			<p>As aviation traffic continues to bounce back following widespread vaccination programmes, the IFC market may now be on the path to recovery, says NSR. But other changes will also likely impact take-up and asks whether &lsquo;free&rsquo; on-board Wi-Fi is a reasonable expectation. Either way, NSR suggests that available bandwidth to operators and passengers will boom: &ldquo;With the free service model in mind, NSR forecasts that High Throughput Satellite (HTS) capacity demand alone will grow from 13 Gb/s in 2020 to 924 Gb/s by 2030. A free service model on a Wi-Fi network that actually works will increase user take-rates and bandwidth utilisation, driving the exponential growth of capacity demand.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The market is beginning to see a rebound in some regions, while other places with existing travel restrictions are not expected to return to 2019 levels until 2022/23. For example, the US market saw a massive uptake in domestic travel last summer due to pent up demand from months of staying at home; so did passenger appetite for onboard Wi-Fi. In fact, passengers had a stronger demand for inflight Wi-Fi due to the change in working habits orchestrated by the pandemic, where millions of people became accustomed to working remotely from anywhere,&rdquo; states NSR.</p>
			<p>NSR gathers that demand for inflight Wi-Fi is at an all-time high as passengers return to flying. This trend pushes airlines to a tight position of making the critical decision of defining their inflight connectivity strategy.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;One of the tough choices airlines have been battling is whether to offer free onboard Wi-Fi and how to bankroll the associated expenses. Before the pandemic, the industry consistently hinted at the promise of third-party sponsorship and opportunities in e-commerce. While the former has shown some fruition with new partnerships in recent years, the latter seems to lack reasonable prospects &#150; who gets on the plane for a shopping spree? Meanwhile, since NSR&rsquo;s Claude Rousseau published the article &ldquo;Monetizing IFC: The 3rd Party Promise&rdquo; in May 2019, not much significant progress has been made in onboarding third party sponsors for IFC. What then is the future of free onboard Wi-Fi?,&rdquo; asks NSR.</p>
			<p>NSR&rsquo;s AERO9 report determines that free inflight connectivity is still feasible in the near term and will become more widely adopted by various airlines within the decade. &ldquo;The pertinent question is, how will the industry get there? NSR sees three key factors as harbingers of that possibility: sufficient capacity supply, contract optionality and third-party sponsors. Unfortunately, the conversation has predominantly focused on the sponsorship factor, forgetting that the aero market needs adequate satellite capacity to power high passenger take-rates that will become available with a free service model. The good news is that the industry is on the verge of solving the capacity problem.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;One major challenge facing the IFC market is limited capacity. Given that the IFC business was started and dominated by service providers who purchased capacity from satellite operators, it is not a surprise that capacity has historically been pricey and limited &#150; just enough to meet contract service level agreements. As a result, capacity constraints arising from cost and limited coverage have been the bane of IFC take-off,&rdquo; says the NSR report.</p>
			<p>NSR says the IFC market has sailed from the meagre 5-15 Mbps throughput allocated per aircraft at the beginning of IFC 2.0 to north of 50 Mbps. &ldquo;Some IFC providers claim to offer 100+ Mbps, with plans to more than double the number with new capacity coming on board and some equipment upgrades,&rdquo; states NSR.</p>
			<p>A new high-throughput satellite SES-17 will launch on October 22nd with a significant boost to available Wi-Fi bandwidth over the Americas.<br>

			<p>CNBC has reported that in the course contract negotiations between the major Hollywood unions for backstage crews, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) revealed that, as recently as July, Apple claimed it had less than 20 million subscribers to its Apple TV_ streaming service in North America.</p>
			<p>Since launching its subscription streaming service in November 2019, Apple hasn&rsquo;t revealed subscriber numbers. With Apple giving away access to the $4.99-a-month SVoD away to those who bought iPhones and other Apple gadgets for the first 20 months of Apple TV Plus&rsquo; existence, several well-regarded research firms have pegged Apple TV+ at around 40 million subscribers, many of them on via these promotions.</p>
			<p>At that level, Apple was able to pay lower rates than larger streaming services (and the major studios) for everything from costume designers and makeup artists, to camera operators and production designers. A union spokesperson told CNBC that NBCUniversal&rsquo;s Peacock and ViacomCBS&rsquo; Paramount+ also fall under the 20-million subscriber threshold.</p>
			<p>It may be the sub 20 million number only counts users who are paying for the Apple TV+ service, and not the millions who are still on promotion.</p>
			<p>The current contract between the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and IATSE was negotiated in 2009 at a time when streaming media was seen as a nascent business model with an uncertain future. Streaming companies have enjoyed reduced labour rates compared to film and television productions. However, the union is looking to eliminate those discounts in its current negotiations.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.crn.com.au/news/optus-to-trial-rural-satellite-voice-tech-with-federal-government-570247<br>
			</p>
			<p>Optus has been tapped by the Federal Government to trial its satellite services to provide connectivity to rural and remote communities.</p>
			<p>The trials are part of the Government&rsquo;s Alternative Voice Services Trial (AVST) agreement, a $2 million program to provide grants to deliver trial services in different rural and remote locations across Australia. The other telcos invited to trial are Concerotel, NBN Co, Pivotel, Telstra and Zetifi.</p>
			<p>Optus will trial some 15 services at predetermined regional locations in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia. The trial involves fixed and mobile voice calls over data, as well as optional broadband data access with backhaul provided through its satellite network. The trials will run until May 2022.</p>
			<p>The satellite services trialled include SatOffice Direct To Home Voice Over IP, Femto &#150; 4G satellite backhaul, and SatOffice POP Wireless Access Loop for VoIP. Optus will supply all communication infrastructure, including satellite terminals and antennas, wireless equipment, hands-free handsets and mobile phones.</p>
			<p>The telco said the service would provide comparable service quality provided by traditional copper wires, while also opening up coverage beyond fixed line sockets to more hard to reach areas.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;As a pioneer in satellite solutions and a leading regional communications provider for Australia, Optus is delighted to work with the Federal Government to trial innovative options across our world class network,&rdquo; Optus managing director of wholesale, satellite and strategy Ben White said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Through Optus&rsquo; unique combination of satellite and mobile infrastructure, we are able to remove the tyranny of distance when connecting customers with life-changing technology across regional Australia.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;With unrivalled experience in Australia, we&rsquo;re excited to trial state of the art satellite voice technologies designed specifically to address the demands of those without traditional connectivity.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>In Optus&rsquo; announcement, regional communications minister Bridget McKenzie welcomed the telco&rsquo;s approach to the program.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The $2 million AVST program aims to identify new ways to deliver voice services including by new providers, while assessing their effectiveness and raising awareness of alternative solutions to provide better services and functionality,&rdquo; McKenzie said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Optus has an opportunity, with this Liberal Nationals Government funding, to showcase new services that offer greater functionality for people on the farm, including greater ability to use mobile phones around the farm.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Foxtel&rsquo;s 20-channel Flash streaming news service launching in October<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.mediaweek.com.au/foxtels-20-channel-flash-streaming-news-service-launching-in-october/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Kate de Brito to oversee launch: Will News Corp bundle platform with newspapers?</p>
			<p>The Foxtel Group has confirmed it will launch Flash, a first of its kind, dedicated live news streaming service featuring more than 20 local and global live news sources.</p>
			<p>To be launched in October, Flash is promising a diverse range of local and global television news sources live and on demand.</p>
			<p>The flagship offering of the package will be Sky News Australia and associated streams Sky News Weather and Sky News Extra. Fox Sports News should be part of the package too.</p>
			<p>Other existing Foxtel news channels that will join Flash should be Sky News UK, BBC World News, Fox News, CNN, CNBC, Bloomberg Television, Aljazeera, TRT World, NHK Newsline.</p>
			<p>Since the demise of Sky News Business and the short-lived News Corp/Nine JV Your Money, Foxtel has carried no domestic business channel. That could make the David Koch ausbiz channel a possible contender for Flash. Giving Flash subscribers access to Ticker News might also be a possibility.</p>
			<p>Another highlight of Flash will be the recently revealed News Corp British channel talkTV. Just last week News UK explained: talkTV will offer a mix of programming from News UK&rsquo;s stable of household brands. There will be proper hourly news bulletins, sports and entertainment shows as well as current affairs, debate, opinion and documentaries.</p>
			<p>New format shows will be introduced using talent from News UK brands &#150; talkRADIO, talkSPORT, Virgin Radio, Times Radio, The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times.</p>
			<p>The Foxtel Group today also confirmed the appointment of Kate de Brito (pictured) as executive director, Flash. De Brito was previously editor-in-chief of news.com.au, one of Australia&rsquo;s most popular digital news sites, with an average monthly audience of over 10 million. She has worked as a news, feature and opinion writer for more than 20 years across digital, newspapers and magazines.</p>
			<p>Foxtel Group CEO, Patrick Delany, said: &ldquo;We are excited to lock in our plans to launch Flash next month, the third streaming service we will have launched in as many years.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;These new streaming products are driving rapid growth in subscribers and revenue as we diversify our portfolio of entertainment brands and reinvent the Foxtel Group as Australia&rsquo;s most dynamic streaming company.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The number of Australian households with a streaming service is forecast to grow by almost 20% in the next four years, reaching 85% of all households, with each household expected to have between three and four SVOD subscriptions.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Flash will ride this wave, offering news-hungry Australians a new way to stay informed about politics, business and local and international events. We believe the product will tap into a growing demand for diverse, trusted news sources by making the best range of Australian and international 24-7 television news sources even more accessible.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Delany added: &ldquo;Flash won&rsquo;t be what the market expects. It will be more than simply aggregating live channels. Our experience and technology platform gives us the ability to draw on successful Kayo features and innovations to provide an outstanding news experience for our subscribers.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>How much will Flash cost?</p>
			<p>The big missing piece of the Flash puzzle so far is how much it will cost. For the streaming news channels alone the upper limit will probably be $10. That is the basic cost of a Binge subscription and it would be unlikely to cost more than that at launch.</p>
			<p>However the opportunity to bundle News Corp Australia news products could see that price creep higher if a subscriber could get access to The Australian or the News Corp metro mastheads.</p>
			<p>Foxtel has promised to reveal more about Flash on Thursday September 7.<br>

			<p>WASHINGTON &#151; Rocket Lab will launch an Astroscale mission to rendezvous with a spent rocket stage in low Earth orbit, a prelude to eventually deorbiting the stage.</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab announced Sept. 21 that it won a contract from Astroscale for the launch of its Active Debris Removal by Astroscale-Japan (ADRAS-J) spacecraft. A Rocket Lab Electron will launch ADRAS-J from its Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand in 2023.</p>
			<p>ADRAS-J will rendezvous with and inspect an upper stage left in orbit by a Japanese launch. The Japanese space agency JAXA awarded Tokyo-based Astroscale a contract in 2020 for the mission as part of its two-phase Commercial Removal of Debris Demonstration project. The second phase, which will involve an attempt to deorbit the upper stage, has not yet been competed by JAXA.</p>
			<p>The mission requires a precise orbital insertion so that the spacecraft can reach the rocket stage. &ldquo;Rendezvousing with a piece of debris on orbit, traveling at around 27,000 kilometers per hour, is a highly complex task that requires absolute precision when it comes to orbital deployment,&rdquo; Rocket Lab Chief Executive Peter Beck said in a statement. &ldquo;Electron&rsquo;s Kick Stage has demonstrated this precision across 18 missions, providing in-space transportation to place our customers&rsquo; satellites exactly where they need to go.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>In-situ inspection, like what ADRAS-J will perform, is one of several business lines for Astroscale, said Mike Lindsay, chief technology officer of the company, during a panel discussion at the Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies, or AMOS, Conference Sept. 15. Other lines of business include satellite life extension and transfer.</p>
			<p>Astroscale is best known, though, for developing technologies to enable deorbiting satellites at the end of their lives, as well as active debris removal. The company has been testing some of those technologies on its first spacecraft, End-of-Life Services by Astroscale-demonstration (ELSA-d), which launched in March on a Soyuz rideshare mission.</p>
			<p>Astroscale performed the first release and capture of a client spacecraft on ELSA-d Aug. 25, deploying the small spacecraft from the main one and then capturing it using a magnetic mechanism. A series of more complex tests, including attempting to capture the client while tumbling, are scheduled for the next several months, Lindsay said.</p>
			<p>The launch contract is the second that Rocket Lab has announced this month. The company said Sept. 8 it won a contract for five Electron launches to deploy a 25-satellite internet-of-things constellation for French startup Kin&eacute;is. Those launches will begin in the second quarter of 2023.</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab announced the contract after markets closed Sept. 21. Shares in Rocket Lab, which started trading publicly on the Nasdaq Aug. 25 after the completion of its merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), closed up about 0.5% at $14.54 Sept. 22, up nearly 40% from the end of its first day of trading.<br>

			<p><b><i>SpaceX satellite signals used like GPS to pinpoint location on Earth<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.gpsdaily.com/reports/SpaceX_satellite_signals_used_like_GPS_to_pinpoint_location_on_Earth_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>Engineering researchers have developed a method to use signals broadcast by Starlink internet service satellites to accurately locate a position here on Earth, much like GPS does. It is the first time the Starlink system has been harnessed by researchers outside SpaceX for navigation.</p>
			<p>The Starlink satellites, sent into orbit by Elon Musk's SpaceX, are designed to provide broadband internet connections in remote locations around the world. The researchers used signals from six Starlink satellites to pinpoint a location on Earth within 8 meters of accuracy.</p>
			<p>Their findings, shared at the Institute of Navigation GNSS annual meeting in St. Louis, may provide a promising alternative to GPS. Their results will be published in the upcoming issue of the journal IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems.</p>
			<p>The researchers did not need assistance from SpaceX to use the satellite signals, and they emphasized that they had no access to the actual data being sent through the satellites - only to information related to the satellite's location and movement.</p>
			<p>&quot;We eavesdropped on the signal, and then we designed sophisticated algorithms to pinpoint our location, and we showed that it works with great accuracy,&quot; said Zak Kassas, director of the Center for Automated Vehicles Research with Multimodal Assured Navigation (CARMEN), a multi-institution transportation center housed at The Ohio State University.</p>
			<p>&quot;And even though Starlink wasn't designed for navigation purposes, we showed that it was possible to learn parts of the system well enough to use it for navigation.&quot;</p>
			<p>CARMEN is one of four recently awarded U.S. Department of Transportation University Transportation Centers. Kassas is an adjunct professor of electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State and an associate professor at the University of California, Irvine.</p>
			<p>For this research, Kassas and his research team studied the Starlink system and analyzed signals being sent by the satellites. They developed an algorithm that could use the signals of multiple satellites to locate a position on Earth. Then, they set up an antenna on the campus of UCI and tried to use the network to pinpoint the antenna's location.</p>
			<p>Using Starlink, they identified the antenna's location within about 7.7 meters. GPS, by comparison, generally identifies a device's location within 0.3 and 5 meters. The team has used similar techniques with other low Earth orbit satellite constellations, but with less accuracy, pinpointing locations within about 23 meters, Kassas said. The team has also been working with the U.S. Air Force to pinpoint locations of high-altitude aircraft; they were able to come within 5 meters using land-based cellular signals, Kassas said.</p>
			<p>SpaceX has some 1,700 satellites in Earth's low orbit, meaning they circle the planet about 1,200 km from Earth's surface. SpaceX ultimately plans to launch more than 40,000 satellites.</p>
			<p>Kassas said as the Starlink constellation grows, so, too, will the accuracy of his team's navigation and geo-location technique with its signals.</p>
			<p>Their discovery could allow the government or other agencies to use Starlink's satellites as an alternative navigation system - and possibly, a more secure one - to GPS, which powers almost all navigation systems around the world, Kassas said.</p>
			<p>GPS has been in place for more than 30 years and its signals are well-known, akin to open-source software, Kassas said. That is an asset to companies that develop GPS receivers in smartphones, wearable fitness devices and vehicles, but it also makes the system vulnerable to attacks. GPS satellites are also farther away from Earth than low-Earth orbiting systems, making their signals weaker, and therefore more susceptible to interference.</p>
			<p>Jamming attacks on GPS signals can take down GPS signals altogether, which has been a growing problem for aviation. Spoofing attacks on GPS can manipulate where a given vehicle appears in systems designed to monitor locations and prevent vehicles from overlapping routes; attacks can also take over a vehicle's path - for example, some attacks have overtaken military and civilian drones, maritime vessels, and even Tesla's autopilot.</p>
			<p>The Starlink system is appealing to navigation experts, Kassas said, because the signals, until now, have been private - SpaceX has not shared them with governments or researchers. Starlink satellites are closer to Earth than GPS satellites are, making their signals much stronger and less susceptible to interference.</p>
			<p>&quot;The important catch here is that we are not 'listening' in on what is being sent over these satellites,&quot; Kassas said. &quot;We learned the signals just well enough to harness them for navigation purposes.&quot;<br>

			<p><b><i>What's behind Africa's increasing drive to launch satellites<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.africadaily.net/reports/Whats_behind_Africas_increasing_drive_to_launch_satellites_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>Twenty-two years after putting the first African satellite into orbit, the continent's satellite fleet currently stands at 44. With Africa's most recent satellite launch taking place in June 2021, the next few years may see more launches on the continent.</p>
			<p>The consultancy Space in Africa recently reported that 44 satellites have been sent into orbit by 13 African countries since the launch of the continent's first satellite in 1999. At the time, South Africa had launched its SunSat-1 satellite into space.</p>
			<p>According to the Space in Africa report, a further 125 satellites are being developed by 23 countries on the continent, and all of them are expected to be launched before 2025.</p>
			<p>The survey refers to &quot;new opportunities&quot; that have emerged &quot;around satellite constellations on the continent, with Egypt, South Africa, and Tunisia leading various initiatives&quot; on the matter.</p>
			<p>&quot;While Africa is currently unable to launch satellites from the continent, new opportunities are now emerging for foreign players to capitalise on several launch sites available on the continent. The [space] industry made [a] revenue of USD 7.37 billion in 2019 and is expected to generate over USD 10.24 billion in revenue by 2024&quot;, the report says.</p>
			<p>The report came as Khalid Manjoo, co-founder and CTO of the South African start-up Astrofica that was founded in 2017, said that the goal of the firm is to use the space industry to tackle Africa's pressing issues, including food and national security.</p>
			<p>Manjoo insisted that Astrofica may launch its first constellation of satellites by the end of 2022, which he said &quot;will provide decision makers with critical data sets [in] near real time&quot;. He expressed hope that the data will be used for monitoring crop yields or tracking the use of fertilisers, as well as helping governments with water management.</p>
			<p>&quot;The satellites that we put up in space, it's cool stuff, but it's not necessarily the end goal; the end goal for Astrofica is to deal with the challenges and problems that we would like to solve. They cannot be solved using purely terrestrial systems, they need these critical space-based insights&quot;, the Astrofica CTO stressed.</p>
			<p>He noted that Astrofica seeks to launch its first satellite on board an American SpaceX rocket, a Russian Soyuz rocket, or a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle in India.</p>
			<p>Manjoo was echoed by Bryan Dean, CEO of the South African company Dragonfly Aerospace, who makes imaging systems for satellites and is currently developing its own satellite constellation.</p>
			<p>Dean asserted that &quot;the new space industry has a lot of opportunity because there's a lot of growth&quot;.</p>
			<p>According to him: &quot;You are now able to launch more satellites for the same amount of money than you were in the past, and a system of satellites in orbit is far more powerful than a single satellite because they work together and combine the data&quot;.</p>
			<p>Dean added that his company is wrapping up a 3,000-square-metre satellite manufacturing facility in the South African town of Stellenbosch, which will have an annual capacity to build up to 48 satellites.</p>
			<p>Minoo Rathnasabapathy, a South Africa-born space research engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), however, told CNN that the continent's space industry has yet to resolve a number of challenges, including a lack of resources.</p>
			<p>&quot;When you consider the US or Europe, it's really apples and oranges. In the US we see a lot of private industry and a lot of private funding and we're seeing NASA and ESA [the European Space Agency] be able to tap into that funding. Whereas in Africa, we're just not there yet and that's completely understandable given other priorities of the countries&quot;, she claimed.</p>
			<p>Rathnasabapathy said that despite &quot;huge amounts of investments&quot;, countries are &quot;slowly starting to understand that the investment in space today is actually for the sustainability and prosperity of your country and your region in the years to come&quot;.</p>
			<p>SES Networks Africa Vice President Caroline Kamaitha has, meanwhile, suggested that African countries want to be part of the global space satellite race because they need cheaper, high-speed internet.</p>
			<p>&quot;Governments are taking a really huge step to ensure that their people in those different countries are able to get connectivity&quot;, she said in an interview with the news website Quartz.</p>
			<p>She mentioned &quot;landlocked&quot; nations that &quot;do not have access to undersea cables and have to go through multiple countries to get connectivity&quot;. Kamaitha added that &quot;there is still demand for good connectivity in those markets and [a] satellite is an answer&quot;.<br>

				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/09/24/warnermedia-opens-new-asian-hub-in-singapore/<br>
			</p>
			<p>WarnerMedia has opened a new regional hub for Asia &#150; excluding China and Japan &#150; in Singapore.</p>
			<p>The facility, which was opened today by Singapore&rsquo;s minister for communications and information Josephine Teo, marks the integration of WarnerMedia&rsquo;s business in the region that includes Warner Bros., HBO and Turner brands, the company said. It also houses the new streaming platform HBO Max, which is expected to launch in its first Asian markets in the near future.</p>
			<p>WarnerMedia expects to substantially increase its staff count in Singapore in the coming years, including those in the technology field as the company increases focus on its direct-to-consumer streaming business led by Amit Malhotra, managing director for HBO Max in Southeast Asia, India and Korea.</p>
			<p>The new office is a 40,000 square feet facility across two floors at Solaris in Fusionopolis, the city state&rsquo;s media and tech business park. The space was designed by Singapore firm ID21 and incorporates a post-COVID and flexible work environment inspired by an &ldquo;Activity Based Work&rdquo; strategy, according to the media giant.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Our new flagship office is truly spectacular. More than just a new workspace, it brings together the most incredible parts of our diverse business &#150; from Harry Potter&rsquo;s Wizarding World to Looney Tunes, Game of Thrones and Wonder Woman &#150; under one roof for the first time. Here in Singapore, we have long supported a sizeable ecosystem for the entertainment, broadcast, production and licensing industries. From our new Singapore hub, we will continue with our ambitious plans for the region,&rdquo; said Clement Schwebig, managing director of WarnerMedia for India, Southeast Asia and Korea.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;As we get ready to launch HBO Max in our first Asian markets, we&rsquo;ll build on WarnerMedia&rsquo;s legacy of incredible stories and introduce a brand-new streaming experience for our fans in the region. Our new office space in Singapore as a regional HQ will be the perfect backdrop for the innovative work to be done in the lead up to our launch,&rdquo; said Malhotra.<br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/09/23/183735/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Wurl, a specialist in powering streaming TV, has unveiled Wurl Perform, a new performance marketing service that enables streaming TV apps to acquire new viewers and reduce churn via highly targeted promotional campaigns. With Wurl Perform, every campaign impression and conversion is measured, which provides Streamers trackable ROAS (return on ad spend).</p>
			<p>&ldquo;As the world&rsquo;s TV viewing shifts to streaming, streamers need effective ways to acquire new viewers and keep existing viewers engaged,&rdquo; said Sean Doherty, Jr, COO of Wurl. &ldquo;But without the ability to measure the performance of promotional campaigns, streamers are likely to waste money. Wurl Perform was designed to address this challenge. Like the performance-based marketing services that revolutionised customer acquisition on mobile apps and the web, Wurl is bringing data-driven targeting and measurement to customer acquisition on television for the first time.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Wurl Perform&rsquo;s data-driven targeting begins by analysing the content interests of hundreds of millions of TV viewers. Machine learning and predictive algorithms are then used to deliver promo ads to only those viewers determined to have a high-ranked interest in the promoted content. Wurl measures the results of every Perform promo ad to identify which viewers were converted to watch the promoted content.</p>
			<p>Wurl Perform began a beta test in May 2021 with 25 FAST streamers including Bloomberg Quicktake, Stories by AMC, Cheddar News, Gravitas Movies, DangerTV and others running Perform campaigns to acquire new viewers. The Perform beta participants&rsquo; campaigns delivered individually targeted promos to millions of viewers who were predicted to have a high potential for conversion by Wurl&rsquo;s machine learning engine. Conversion was precisely measured for each individual viewer who saw one or more promos. Based on results of over 4 million viewers viewers in North America from May to August 2021, the key findings include:<br>
				&bull;When users became informed of new content, they increased their overall engagement with the streaming platform, including watching a greater variety of content and increasing their hours of viewing.<br>
				&bull;Measured across all promo viewers, the conversion rate was approximately 4 per cent. When Perform targeted viewers who were ranked as very highly likely to convert, conversion rates were close to 20 per cent.<br>
				&bull;Overall viewer engagement with the platform increased significantly for viewers who watched promos. There was an approximately 20 per cent uplift in the daily average viewing from promo viewers.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Wurl Perform is the world&rsquo;s first and only performance-based marketing service for TV,&rdquo; continued Doherty. &ldquo;Wurl processes over 120TB of data daily related to viewing activity on streaming apps, allowing for targeting precision that has previously only been available on mobile apps and the web.  During our beta, Wurl Perform produced outstanding results for the 25 companies that used the service. Our beta customers saw conversion rates increase 10x, with an average return on ad spend of more than 4x, and as much as 20x for some participants.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://news.satnews.com/2021/09/20/saves-lives-and-protects-express-am5-satellite-will-warn-about-seismic-activity/?mohide=true&amp;mc_cid=2fdf52bacb&amp;mc_eid=e80892f101<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Russian Satellite Communications Company (RSCC) and an international service provider Hunter Communications have put in place communication channels to monitor the Earth&rsquo;s seismic activity. High-precision seismometers are installed in a number of regions of Yakutia, transmitting data via the Express-AM5 communications and broadcasting satellite located in geostationary orbit at 140&deg; E.</p>
			<p>Over one and a half million square kilometers of Yakutia&rsquo;s territory are earthquake-prone. Every year, hundreds of earthquakes of various strengths occur here up to 9-10 points on the 12-point MSK-64 scale. The most dangerous are the northeast and south of Yakutia. The sensors allow you to record the vibration of the earth&rsquo;s crust, even if the source of the shock wave is located in another region of the globe, which makes it possible to predict an earthquake in advance. Going forward, the coverage of the VSAT network for monitoring seismic activity will be expanded to include the whole of Eastern Siberia.</p>
			<p>According to Hunter Communications president Brent Perrot, &ldquo;Sixteen years ago, Hunter helped establish the first such seismic monitoring network in the Caribbean. For that many years, early warning signals from seismic sensors made it possible to arrange timely evacuation of residents from the dangerous areas and save several hundred thousand lives. In 2021, it was information about an impending volcanic eruption, received from the sensors on the Saint Vincent Islands off the coast of Venezuela that made it possible for local authorities to stave off catastrophic consequences and avoid loss of life. We are confident that our expertise in building such networks and well-developed technologies will help in our joint work with RSCC on a project in Russia.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>For his part, RSCC General Director Alexey Volin noted that RSCC seeks to maximize the use of satellite technologies, &ldquo;Today our satellites support options to receive not only communication and television services. They can be used in other areas that are extremely important for the economy and life in general. The use of satellites for monitoring seismic activity is one of the new aspects of our business. I am sure that our efforts will not be limited only to Eastern Siberia. Since our satellites now cover 69% of the Earth&rsquo;s surface, this service may be in demand in other regions as well.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Blind auction for English Premier League rights could reshape Aussie streaming landscape<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/blind-auction-for-english-premier-league-rights-could-re-shape-aussie-streaming-landscape-20210919-p58sx4.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>English Premier League officials have begun informal talks with local media companies about broadcast rights to the world&rsquo;s most watched soccer competition ahead of a blind auction that could reshape the Australian streaming market.</p>
			<p>The EPL rights, currently held by telecom operator Optus, are expected to fetch as much as $80 million annually in the auction which will be held before the end of the year, according to industry sources who requested anonymity because the process is confidential.</p>
			<p>Optus snatched the EPL rights from Fox Sports in 2015 but its existing deal expires at the end of the current season, in the middle of 2022.</p>
			<p>The EPL rights auction is expected to be a four-way battle involving two Australian broadcasters, Optus and Stan Sport, and two cashed-up American-owned players, Paramount+ and Amazon Prime Video, which both have aggressive growth ambitions. Stan is owned by Nine Entertainment, which also owns this masthead.</p>
			<p>All four companies declined to comment, while the Premier League was also contacted for comment.</p>
			<p>The EPL, the world&rsquo;s most-watched domestic football competition, is considered the crown jewel of football rights and is the last rights package available for streaming services in this market that will be a major driver of subscriptions. In the past year, deals for the NRL, AFL, rugby union, netball, A-League and Formula One have all been either renegotiated, extended with their incumbent rights holder, or moved to another service.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Of all the content coming to market in the foreseeable future, the EPL rights are probably the last ones that have the potential to drive incremental subs for a streaming service,&rdquo; said Andrew Condon, managing director of sports marketing consultancy Gemba.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;A lot of the other content in and around the place is relatively minor, but we&rsquo;ve seen Optus build their business around it. The ability to add that to an Amazon Prime, Paramount+ or Stan is going to add some significant opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Well-placed industry sources expect the rights could cost up to $75-$80 million annually, over a three-year period. However, given the anticipated level of competition, they could go for even more money, with the blind auction to be conducted in November, according to the sources.</p>
			<p>Australia&rsquo;s streaming market has evolved dramatically since Optus first won the EPL rights seven years ago for a reported $50 million per year. Back then, Optus was just a telco provider, and none of Kayo Sports, Amazon Prime, Paramount+ or Stan Sport even existed.</p>
			<p>Football rights have become heavily fragmented in Australia, and the EPL looms as a content offering that could be make or break for the future of several services.</p>
			<p>Optus has more than 900,000 active subscribers and, according to sources, is keen to retain the EPL rights but will not spend irrationally to keep them. The company recently lost the UEFA Champions League to Stan Sport, but won the rights to broadcast the 2023 FIFA Women&rsquo;s World Cup, and has used its football offering to convert viewers into mobile phone and internet customers under a strategy first hatched by ex-chief executive Allan Lew.</p>
			<p>Stan Sport - which is owned by Nine Entertainment Co, the publisher of this masthead - could use the EPL to compliment their UEFA rights, but may also struggle financially to secure them. Shares in Nine fell 10 per cent following annual results when investors flinched at the cost associated with investing in sports rights for Stan&rsquo;s new sports arm. Nine boss Mike Sneesby said at the company&rsquo;s annual results that it would only bid on sports if they made sense commercially.</p>
			<p>Foxtel is expected to look at obtaining the rights, other industry sources said, but it is not a key part of the media company&rsquo;s future strategy.</p>
			<p>Amazon and Paramount+, which is owned by ViacomCBS, both have the capacity to table much higher bids given the wealth of their parent companies. Amazon Prime has the rights to 20 Premier League matches per season in the UK, and has begun experimenting with sports broadcasting in Australia after becoming Swimming Australia&rsquo;s exclusive broadcast partner.</p>
			<p>Paramount+ has also used football as the cornerstone of its sport offering overseas, and particularly in the United States. It has already committed to spending approximately $300 million on sports rights earlier this year after securing the A-League and W-League, as well as Matildas and Socceroos matches - some of which will be shown on Network Ten.</p>
			<p>According to a survey conducted by Gemba on the streaming market in Australia conducted shortly after Paramount+ launched in Australia on August 11, just four per cent of households have access to the service, compared to Stan Sport (seven per cent), Amazon (24 per cent), Optus (10 per cent), Kayo Sports (14 per cent) and Netflix (66 per cent).</p>
			<p>The survey also shows that despite the frustrations of many viewers over the fragmentation of sports rights, people are continuing to spend more on streaming services. It found 85 per cent of Australians subscribe to a sport, entertainment or music service - up five per cent from 2020. The average person has 3.6 subscriptions, and only 20 per cent of people are planning to reduce their spend on streaming services in the next three months, which shows why more companies are eager to enter such an already competitive market.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The sport and entertainment we&rsquo;re passionate about, and we love engaging with, it&rsquo;s very rarely a rational decision. It&rsquo;s an emotional decision,&rdquo; Mr Condon said. &ldquo;The thought of not being able to follow my team or keep abreast of my sport like I did five years ago is probably too much for most fans. I think that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re starting to see that propensity to purchase is continuing to go up.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Deep Pockets CBS Viacom Set To Bid For NRL To Bolster TEN<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.channelnews.com.au/deep-pockets-cbs-viacom-set-to-bid-for-nrl-to-bolster-ten/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Network Ten owners CBS Viacom has deep pockets and despite poor ratings in the past, the US owned network is currently working on making a major pitch for the rights to NRL according to sources.</p>
			<p>The move is seen internally as way for the network to bolster their fortunes and be seen as a major free to air TV network, some insiders have said that the NRL is backing the move as a way to put pressure on the current holders of the free to air rights Nine Entertainment.</p>
			<p>One stumbling block is believed to be Foxtel as CBS Viacom also own the recently launched Paramount + and want to stream more sport on their own streaming network this could lead to them making a pitch for the rights to State Of Origin which we understand the Seven Network will also make a bid for.</p>
			<p>Currently Nine Entertainment are being pushed to pay more for the NRL rights going forward, as well las sign up for a five-year deal similar to what Foxtel have in place with the NRL.</p>
			<p>ChannelNews has been told that the rights could go for $100M up from the $85M a season that Nine are currently paying.</p>
			<p>Currently, the NRL receives two-thirds of its total broadcast revenue from Foxtel, which last year extended its pay-TV deal until the 2027 season. NRL boss Peter V&rsquo;landys is said to want the organisation&rsquo;s free-to-air deal to be paid up to the same year.</p>
			<p>V&rsquo;landys is also concerned that Nine Entertainment who also have the rights to Rugby Union in Australia after Foxtel chose not to bid for the rights, is heavily promoting Rugby on their Stan streaming network at the expense of NRL.</p>
			<p>One source said, &ldquo;Getting the NRL rights will go a long way to fixing Network Tens profile with consumers&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also a cheap way for a US owned network to bolster an Australian owned asset as they also have the benefit of a weak Australian dollar which at A$100M is only US$72M&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Nine is currently paying for the rights to three weekly Thursday, Friday and &shy;Sunday games, plus Saturday games in the last month of the regular season, all finals games (including the grand final) and its jewel in the crown, the State of Origin series.</p>
			<p>ChannelNews understands that the Seven, Nine and Ten networks are all bidding for State Of Origin Rights and that the NRL could see a &ldquo;significant lift&rdquo; in revenue from the rights to the State Of Origin Games.</p>
			<p>In the USA CBS Viacom, ESPN/ABC, Fox, and NBC agreed to pay $123 Billion the next 11 years for the rights to air pro football games, a 108 percent increase compared with the $59 billion the networks will have spent when their current deal ends this year.</p>
			<p>The NFL games&rsquo; total cost will reach about $144 billion when Amazon&rsquo;s streaming deal is included claim observers/</p>
			<p>A Ten insider confirmed to News Corp recently: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re interested&rdquo;, before quickly adding: &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re waiting for the NRL&rsquo;s engagement.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>We also understand that a fight is also emerging for the Australian right to the English Premier League, the world&rsquo;s most watched soccer competition.</p>
			<p>The EPL rights, currently held by Optus, are expected to fetch as much as $80 million annually in the auction which will be held before the end of the year, according to industry sources who requested anonymity because the process is confidential claims the SMH.</p>
			<p>The EPL rights auction is expected to be a four-way battle involving two Australian broadcasters, Optus and Stan Sport, and two cashed-up American-owned players, Paramount+ and Amazon Prime Video, which both have aggressive growth ambitions. Stan is owned by Nine Entertainment, which also owns this masthead.</p>
			<p>All four companies declined to comment, while the Premier League was also contacted for comment.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				https://advanced-television.com/2021/09/20/starlink-to-end-beta-test-in-oct/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Elon Musk, in one of his regular Tweets, says that the Starlink initial beta broadband-by-satellite test stage will end in October. This early adopter test-stage has more than 100,000 users spread over 17 countries.</p>
			<p>SpaceX has launched almost 1,800 Starlink satellites into orbit and well over 1600 are fully working.</p>
			<p>Musk&rsquo;s Tweet suggests that a normal (non-beta) service could also be launched at about the same time. Not all countries have yet granted Starlink &lsquo;landing rights&rsquo; for its signals, but the new Mk 2 versions with their laser inter-satellite links will help get those signals to and from their destination.</p>
			<p>SpaceX has previously said it has pre-orders from some 600,000 potential users and Musk has admitted that the first half-million will get a service, but that handling &ldquo;several million&rdquo; users might be more of a challenge.</p>
			<p>Those challenges will evaporate when more satellites are in orbit. The current plan is to have 4,425 in orbit by 2024 &#150; and perhaps sooner if Musk&rsquo;s giant Starship can be brought into use.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.mediaweek.com.au/sca-chooses-mediahub-to-manage-and-deliver-sky-news-regional-channels-across-australia/<br>
			</p>
			<p>MediaHub provided 3 free to air, dedicated, live 24-hour news channels in 3 days</p>
			<p>It was Sky News Australia that recommended SCA use MediaHub to deliver their services across regional Australia.</p>
			<p>MediaHub Australia executive head of operations Scott Jolly explained, &ldquo;SCA and Sky News were keen to partner with MediaHub due to our quality of service and the collaborative relationship we already had with Sky News Australia. After a series of meetings and discussions with SCA we were awarded the contract.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>As a result, Sky News Regional launched offering free-to-air channels to viewers in parts of NSW, VIC, QLD and SA with a focus on live breaking news, weather, national affairs and sport from the Sky News Australia and Fox Sports News teams.</p>
			<p>Jolly continued, &ldquo;SCA required three HD channels for regional Queensland, regional Southern NSW and regional Victoria. The channels are a mix of Sky News Australia and FOX SPORTS News programming. On a technical level they required connectivity via MediaHub&rsquo;s FibreHub network to and from four live studios including live talkback. They also needed channel branding and graphics capabilities, promo and commercial content aggregation and commercial insertion for each of the three markets. Finally, SCA wanted us to provide programme record, preparation and turnaround for replay and breaking news quick-switching capabilities.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The requirements were comprehensive, but the timeframe was tight. According to Jolly, this wasn&rsquo;t an issue for MediaHub Australia.</p>
			<p>MediaHub</p>
			<p>He continued, &ldquo;MediaHub provided three free to air, dedicated, live 24-hour news channels within three weeks. This included building workflows for schedule delivery and conversion, graphics requirements, commercial aggregation from suppliers and workflows for promos. Our solution also includes facilitating an exclusive dedicated breakfast show for Sky News Regional viewers.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Now complete and operational, the new MediaHub Australia solution comprises of fully redundant A and B broadcast chains allowing for high availability delivered from MediaHub&rsquo;s datacentre in Ingleburn, NSW, including ingest, processing, channel creation, presentation playout and distribution operations.</p>
			<p>Sky News head of operations and Innovation Mark McKeown said, &ldquo;MediaHub is one of our most trusted technology partners. The team is innovative and efficient, and its products and services are flexible, scalable and reliable which is critical for live events and 24/7 channels.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>SCA head of engineering Dan Jackson added, &ldquo;SCA was able to take full advantage of the pre-existing relationships between MediaHub and Sky. This relationship clearly allowed MediaHub to provide a quick and efficient solution that meets our needs and was evident with a seamless transition on the night.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>With Mark McKeown and the Sky News team and Dan Jackson and the SCA team clearly impressed, Scott Jolly concluded by acknowledging the fundamentals that made this project such a success by saying, &ldquo;It was a pleasure to collaborate on this project with both the Sky News and SCA teams and its testament to their skills and determination that we achieved this all so quickly. MediaHub has an excellent and close working relationship with Sky News Australia providing playout for their channels on Foxtel and their OTT platforms and we are delighted to expand on the services we provide for SCA on free to air.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>SpaceX emphasizes coordination with other satellite operators<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacenews.com/spacex-emphasizes-coordination-with-other-satellite-operators/<br>
			</p>
			<p>SpaceX says it's working closely with a number of government and commercial satellite operators to coordinate close approaches involving Starlink satellites with their spacecraft. Credit: SpaceX</p>
			<p>WAILEA, Hawaii &#151; Two years after the close approach of a Starlink satellite with a European Space Agency satellite alarmed some in the space industry, SpaceX says it&rsquo;s working closely with a wide range of satellite operators to ensure safe space operations.</p>
			<p>In September 2019, ESA announced it maneuvered an Earth science satellite called Aeolus when the agency determined it would pass dangerously close to a Starlink satellite. The incident was exacerbated by a breakdown in communication between ESA and SpaceX in the days leading up to the close approach.</p>
			<p>After that incident &ldquo;we went to work coordinating&rdquo; with both commercial and government satellite operators, said David Goldstein, principal guidance navigation and control engineer at SpaceX, during a panel discussion at the Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies, or AMOS, Conference here Sept. 16.</p>
			<p>The best-known example of that coordination is a Space Act Agreement between NASA and SpaceX announced in March. Under the terms of that agreement, SpaceX agreed to move its Starlink satellites in the event of any close approaches with NASA spacecraft, a move intended to avoid scenarios when both parties maneuvered their satellites.</p>
			<p>In addition to that agreement, Goldstein said the company has a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the U.S. Space Force and a &ldquo;good working relationship&rdquo; with ESA and the European Union&rsquo;s Space Surveillance and Tracking program.</p>
			<p>Those partnerships extend even to OneWeb, a company that complained in Federal Communications Commission filings about a close approach one of its newly launched satellites had with a Starlink satellite in March. &ldquo;We have a great working relationship with OneWeb after that conjunction in March,&rdquo; Goldstein said. &ldquo;Just fantastic coordination at the operational level.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He specifically praised OneWeb for its support for the ongoing Inspiration4 crewed mission, saying &ldquo;they jumped through a lot of hoops&rdquo; to provide updated information about the orbits of its satellites. Goldstein appeared by video on the panel from SpaceX&rsquo;s headquarters because, he said, he is providing collision avoidance support for Inspiration4, which launched Sept. 15 for what&rsquo;s scheduled to be a three-day mission.</p>
			<p>Other companies SpaceX is working with regarding space traffic management include Astroscale, which is developing technologies to service satellites and remove orbital debris, and United Launch Alliance. The work with ULA, he said, is to address &ldquo;launch COLA [collision avoidance] sorts of issues.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>SpaceX recently signed a contract with LeoLabs, which provides commercial space traffic management services using data from a network of tracking radars it operates. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re doing great work, and we&rsquo;re super proud of the accomplishments they&rsquo;ve had and the help they&rsquo;re providing to us and others,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>Goldstein also expressed interest in Slingshot Beacon, a collaboration platform developed by Slingshot Aerospace to help satellite operators share space traffic information. That tool, he said, could make it easier for companies to share data and coordinate potential conjunctions.</p>
			<p>One of the more controversial aspects of Starlink is its automated collision avoidance system, where the satellites maneuver 12 hours before the time of closest approach if the risk of a collision exceeds a set threshold.</p>
			<p>Goldstein said he did not have up-to-date information on the number of such maneuvers the Starlink fleet has performed to date. However, he said the company informed the FCC that, from December 2020 through May 2021, Starlink satellites made more than 2,000 collision avoidance maneuvers.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The average per satellite during that time is one to two,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a terribly high number for that many spacecraft.&rdquo; SpaceX currently has nearly 1,700 Starlink satellites in orbit.</p>
			<p>Goldstein appeared on a panel that was discussing developing &ldquo;right of way&rdquo; procedures for determining who should maneuver in the event of a close approach. &ldquo;We need a sense of urgency to address things that we can do to avoid the Kessler Syndrome,&rdquo; or a runaway growth of orbital debris. &ldquo;There are things that we can do to make space safer, and we all need a sense of urgency to do what we can to avoid that.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>The Philippines&rsquo; MULA Satellite a Launch Priority<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://opengovasia.com/more-satellite-in-the-philippines-set-to-launch-into-space/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Philippines Space Agency has reported that the Philippines to move forward with more of its establishment of satellites launched to space. According to the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), the MULA (Multispectral Unit for Land Assessment) satellite, which is set to launch in 2023, is on the government&rsquo;s priority list. With its added jet propulsion system, MULA will stay in space longer and take more images than other Filipino-made satellites that have previously been launched.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I am looking forward to seeing how MULA&rsquo;s enhanced imaging capabilities can help improve disaster management, land use and land cover change mapping, crop monitoring and forest monitoring,&rdquo; he said during a virtual event on the Philippine Space Agency&rsquo;s (PhilSA) social media page.</p>
			<p>    The results of our human resource development program are even beyond our expectations considering the difficult working environment where we are in right now. Our country partners like Japan are saying that we are catching up fast. I hope that government budgetary support will be stronger and continuing.</p>
			<p>    &#150; DOST Secretary</p>
			<p>It is said to be twice as heavy and larger than the Diwata-2 microsatellite, with more payloads and spectral bands, allowing it to support more image applications and satellite products. &ldquo;MULA is very significant to the DOST. Aside from being the biggest Philippine satellite developed, this is the first satellite that the DOST is doing in coordination with PhilSA,&rdquo; the DOST chief said.</p>
			<p>The DOST Secretary is convinced in PhilSA&rsquo;s ability to oversee the completion and expected launch of MULA, as well as manage and operate the satellite afterwards. &ldquo;It gives me the pride to see first-hand how the DOST&rsquo;s early space R&amp;D (research and development) activities have helped capable young Filipino scientists and engineers,&rdquo; the official said, adding that the MULA team&rsquo;s dedication inspires him.</p>
			<p>Using the satellite, Filipino researchers could use MULA to mitigate challenges such as water quality and marine resource sustainability, among others. The MULA satellite in low earth orbit can circle the globe ten times per day, expanding opportunities for market data or leveraging collaboration with other nations.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, the launch of two locally built cube satellites (cubesats) to the International Space Station (ISS) &#150; the Maya-3 and Maya-4 &#150; has been delayed due to inclement weather. According to the Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA), another attempt will be made. As per PhilSA&rsquo;s Deputy Director-General, the cubesats will illustrate satellite stabilisation and control in orbit, onboard image processing and classification, as well as the use of solar cells and cubesat antennas, and test sensor and chip functionality.</p>
			<p>In an interview, the Secretary of Science and Technology (DOST) asserted, &ldquo;I am pleased that the country is meeting its targets and timelines in the space technology programme.&rdquo; &ldquo;The collaboration between DOST, PhilSA, and the University of the Philippines (UP) &#150; Diliman has been quite effective,&rdquo; he added.</p>
			<p>Both cubesats were created as part of the STAMINA4Space (Space Technology and Applications Mastery, Innovation, and Advancement) Programme, which was funded by the DOST, UP Diliman, PhilSA, and Japan&rsquo;s Kyushu Institute of Technology. The cubesats are nearly identical, weighing 1.15 kgs and measuring 10 cm (cm) X 10 cm X 11.35 cm.</p>
			<p>Their missions included ground data acquisition demonstrations, image and video capture, detection and protection from single event latch-up due to space radiation, and GPS chip demonstrations, among others. Maya-1 was launched in 2018 and Maya-2 in 2021. Diwata 1 and 2, both microsatellites, were launched in 2016 and 2018, respectively. DOST previously noted that the projects will increase efforts to harness the power of satellite technology for other purposes such as agriculture, forest cover and natural resource inventory, weather forecasting, and disaster damage assessment and monitoring, among others.<br>

			</p>
			<p>The SES claim against Intelsat for a potential $1.8 billion has been postponed.</p>
			<p>Judge Keith Phillips, who is overseeing Intelsat&rsquo;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy reconstruction, had earlier confirmed that the trial date for the SES vs Intelsat dispute over FCC payment allocations would start on September 20th. A new date has not &#150; as yet &#150; been circulated.</p>
			<p>It is understood that both parties have requested a trial where evidence is heard in person (and not via Zoom) and this means that a courtroom has to be found to accommodate witnesses and their counsel. Judge Phillips, who is overseeing Intelsat&rsquo;s bankruptcy, has also previously said that the anticipated two-week trail would begin &ldquo;no later than October 30th&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>SES has already had denied its request for a speedier judgement in its claim.</p>
			<p>The trial, when it happens, will focus on two elements: the SES claim for a larger share (worth $421 million) of the FCC&rsquo;s &lsquo;incentive&rsquo; payments that flowed from the C-Band Alliance&rsquo;s reorganisation of C-band frequencies over the US. The second, and potentially much larger element, demands damages and compensation for what SES claims is a deliberate breach of their contract with Intelsat.<br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/09/17/urc-rte-launch-global-streaming-service/<br>
			</p>
			<p>RT&Eacute; and United Rugby Championship (URC) have launched URC TV, a new global streaming service offering fans around the world the opportunity to watch games live and on-demand, and follow their team home or away.</p>
			<p>URC TV will be a single destination for fans to watch all 151 games when and where they want, with every minute of every URC game live and on-demand.</p>
			<p>The introduction of South Africa&rsquo;s four elite teams to the URC has created a challenge unlike any other rugby as two hemispheres collide as the best of Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales stand their ground against the best of South Africa.</p>
			<p>URC TV is easily accessible across multiple devices with mobile apps launching soon after the tournament starts on September 24th. Matches will be broadcast in HD with English commentary.</p>
			<p> Martin Anayi, chief executive of URC, said: &ldquo;In addition to RT&Eacute; strength in TV it has experience of streaming big sporting events globally and is evidence of a broadcaster that can adapt to market demands and provide a very creative offering for rights holders.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Dee Forbes, RT&Eacute; Director General, added: &ldquo;We are delighted to collaborate with URC on the launch of this innovative new global OTT service to ensure fans across the world don&rsquo;t miss a moment of URC action&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>A free service showing a range of highlights, archive matches and snackable videos, will be available in all countries including the UK and South Africa (fans in these countries can watch all games live on Premier Sports and Super Sport respectively).</p>
			<p>URC TV will also offer a range of subscription packages including a Season Pass (all games), Ireland Pass (all games featuring Irish Clubs), Weekend Passes (all games within a round) and individual games passes. These will be available for fans watching in Ireland, Europe (excluding UK), US and a number of other territories.<br>

			<p><b><i>News UK to launch talkTV <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/09/16/news-uk-to-launch-talktv/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s News UK is to launch a new channel, talkTV, in early 2022.</p>
			<p>The channel will be streamed live and made widely available on all platforms including linear TV and OTT with content available across social media as well as News UK&rsquo;s own inventory of websites and apps. According to News UK, everyone in the UK will be able to access the channel, live or on-demand, either on their television or on any personal device.</p>
			<p>talkTV will offer a mix of programming from News UK&rsquo;s stable of brands. There will be hourly news bulletins, sports and entertainment shows as well as current affairs, debate, opinion and documentaries.</p>
			<p> New format shows will be introduced using talent from News&rsquo; own brands &#150; talkRADIO, talkSPORT, Virgin Radio, Times Radio, The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times.</p>
			<p>News UK says it will hire some &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; new talent to join a schedule of prime time programming for the evenings.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are committed to providing choice for television and streaming viewers and bringing the best of our journalism to the screen,&rdquo; stated Rebekah Brooks, Chief Executive of News UK. &ldquo;Taking advantage of modern technology, we can produce high quality shows at low cost.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;talkTV will provide a rich mix of entertaining and informative shows that no other service provides,&rdquo; added Scott Taunton, CEO of News UK Broadcasting. &ldquo;News UK&rsquo;s brands already engage millions of people through print, digital and audio and we are using those brands to create video programming. We have some of media&rsquo;s biggest names on our radio stations and in our newspapers, as well as some of the most articulate thought-leaders who reflect many different viewpoints. Some of the most talented people in news, sports and entertainment journalism will be taking part as contributors or creating original content for talkTV.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>News UK has invested in new TV studios in its HQ in the News Building in London Bridge. Taunton recently expanded his remit beyond radio and audio and was appointed CEO, News UK Broadcasting and is leading the talkTV launch.</p>
			<p>talkRADIO TV has soft launched on connected TV platforms and is streamed live through the talkRADIO TV app. It is available on Samsung TV Plus, Apple TV, Rakuten, Samsung TV Plus, Roku, YouTube and on Amazon Fire TV.</p>
			<p>There is a free talkRADIO TV app and a livestream on talkRADIO.tv. Its roster of presenters includes Julia Hartley-Brewer, Mike Graham, Trisha Goddard, Rob Rinder and Jeremy Kyle.</p>
			<p>There will be further announcements as the plans evolve.</p>
			<p>The proposed service looks set to benefit from the troubled launch and continued turmoil of GB News.<br>

			<p><b><i>Kacific Launches New Broadband Service<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.satellitetoday.com/broadband/2019/01/11/newtec-selected-to-enhance-broadband-services-on-kacific-1/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Kacific Broadband Satellites is working to bring a new internet service dedicated to businesses in the markets where it operates. It is launching a service called GigWiFi, a service that aims to combine the best of Kacific&rsquo;s Gigstarter and Community WiFi services, allowing businesses to connect office workers to a head office local area network (LAN), while providing internet services to the surrounding community needing remote access to a Wi-Fi service, all from a single terminal.</p>
			<p>GigWiFi aims to be Kacific&rsquo;s most efficient solution for those needing high-speed broadband targeted to agricultural, manufacturing and tourism businesses, government agencies and others. It is designed to work for hybrid workplaces that need both both LAN and Wi-Fi access, but do not want the cost involved with operating two terminals. Under this new, businesses can connect up to seven office staff on a Gigstarter plan and provide monitored Wi-Fi access to workers in fields, warehouses, and yards at the same time.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;GigWiFi is in line with Kacific&rsquo;s core purpose, to make fast affordable broadband available everywhere. It combines the best of two popular plans, Gigstarter and Community WiFi, so customers can enjoy the benefits of high-speed internet and unlimited data for less in all parts of their workplace,&rdquo; Beatrice Mok, Kacific&rsquo;s Marketing Director said in a statement.</p>
			<p>Kacific is based in Singapore and serves South East Asia and the Pacific Islands regions.</p>
			<p>Newtec Selected to Enhance Broadband Services on Kacific 1</p>
			<p>Kacific selected Newtec&lsquo;s Dialog Very Small Aperature Terminal (VSAT) multiservice platform for Kacific 1, its new High Throughput Satellite (HTS). This is expected to significantly expand broadband service delivery in underserved areas of South East Asia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
			<p>The initial contract is for $10 million of Newtec Dialog hubs, and is expected to result in further terminal procurements totaling several million in the first years of service. Kacific 1 aims to deliver affordable, high-speed internet broadband to telecommunications companies, ISPs and governments throughout the region, with Newtec&rsquo;s Mx-DMA return technology aiming to provide high bandwidth efficiency.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The Kacific Hub, based on the Newtec Dialog multiservice platform, is a pivotal part of the satellite network and we selected Newtec because it demonstrates the highest performance and ability to offer the very high link efficiencies and availabilities required for our Ka-band spot beam system,&rdquo; said Kacific Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Founder Christian Patouraux.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/09/15/ses-sees-uptakes-in-cloud-playout-services/<br>
			</p>
			<p>An increasing number of broadcasters and channel operators worldwide are adopting SES&rsquo;s Cloud Playout service to better manage their linear TV channels and content assets flexibly and cost-effectively. This recent shift to cloud-based services means that SES now has more than 60 TV channels from Africa, Europe and Asia-Pacific that started utilising SES Cloud playout services since Q1 2021.</p>
			<p>Leveraging the elastic scale and economics of the cloud, SES&rsquo;s Cloud Playout enables TV broadcasters and channel operators the ability to reliably prepare TV content for broadcast in a matter of minutes regardless of where they are since there is no need for on-premise hardware. Designed natively in the cloud, SES&rsquo;s Cloud Playout provides unparalleled flexibility and scalability while leveraging virtualized hardware with modular design of playout functions such as archiving, playlist, playback, encoding or graphics &#150; all to ensure resiliency and cost-savings for the media customers.</p>
			<p>One market with recent Cloud Playout momentum is Ethiopia. An increasing number of broadcasters on Ethiosat, Ethiopia&rsquo;s first-ever dedicated free-to-air (FTA) TV platform, have moved to SES&rsquo;s Cloud Playout service to better manage their linear TV channels and content assets flexibly and cost-effectively.</p>
			<p>One such Ethiopian customer, Engidawork Gebeyehu at Yegna TV, said, &ldquo;With a focus on local, in-country content, the Ethiopian TV market has been expanding significantly in the last years with TV playing an integral part of people&rsquo;s lives &#150; ranging from entertainment to education &#150; especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. With SES, we are able to respond to viewer demand and bring content to their homes faster and more flexibly than ever before via the cloud, meeting viewer demand for more local content. Using the cloud playout services also means that we are no longer restricted by hardware constraints and can get a channel ready for distribution much faster than before.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;At SES, we believe the cloud can maximise opportunities for growth with an inherently flexible and highly scalable broadcasting solution, enabling our customers to focus on attracting new audiences and create engaging content,&rdquo; said Yvonne Bertalot, Director of Broadcasters Segment Market Management at SES. &ldquo;It is therefore rewarding when we see how our customers feel the same as they increasingly adopt our cloud capabilities to expand their offerings.&rdquo;<br>

We&rsquo;re pleased to add Rakuten TV&rsquo;s FAST service in Europe to Amagi&rsquo;s distribution network.

				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/09/16/apple-tv-major-update-to-launch-next-week/<br>
			</p>
			<p>tvOS 15 will launch on September 20, Apple has confirmed.</p>
			<p>The major Apple TV update will bring significant new features to the streaming box, focused on discovery. </p>
			<p>The first, dubbed For All of You, presents a new row within the Apple TV app that suggests titles for all members of the household to stream together, utilising viewing data from multiple users. The second meanwhile presents titles shared with the user from Messages as a standalone row as part of further integration with other Apple devices. </p>
			<p>Other features coming to Apple TV focus on functionality, such as an on-screen prompt to connect AirPods headphones, HomePod Mini pairing and updates to HomeKit for smart home accessibility.</p>
			<p>The update will be supported on the Apple TV HD, and the Apple TV 4K devices released in both 2017 and 2021.</p>
			<p>One key feature missing at the launch of tvOS 15 &#150; and iOS 15 for that matter &#150; is SharePlay. SharePlay, initially announced earlier this year, will allow FaceTime users to stream titles together in sync across their Apple devices. The feature however was delayed in August, and will arrive at a later date.<br>

			<p>Nearly three dozen OneWeb internet satellites took flight today (Sept. 14), continuing to build out the company's broadband constellation.</p>
			<p>A Soyuz rocket topped with 34 OneWeb spacecraft launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan today at 2:07 p.m. EDT (1807 GMT; 1:07 a.m. Sept. 15 local time in Baikonur). </p>
			<p>If everything goes according to plan, all 34 satellites will have deployed into a near-polar orbit with an altitude of 280 miles (450 kilometers) by about three hours and 45 minutes after liftoff. The solar-powered spacecraft will then gradually make their own way to their operational orbit 746 miles (1,200 km) above Earth.</p>
			<p>That migration will bring the number of satellites in OneWeb's constellation to 322, nearly half of its envisioned size. The London-based communications company is assembling a network of 648 spacecraft, which will beam broadband service down to people around the globe.</p>
			<p>&quot;Once deployed, the OneWeb constellation will enable user terminals that are capable of offering 3G, LTE, 5G and Wi-Fi coverage, providing high-speed access globally &#151; by air, sea and land,&quot; Arianespace representatives wrote in a prelaunch statement.</p>
			<p>Arianespace has launched all of the OneWeb satellites to date over the course of 10 separate missions. The French company achieved a big milestone during today's flight: Arianespace has now lofted more than 1,000 satellites over its 41 years of launch operations.</p>
			<p>OneWeb, which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy late last year, aims to start providing internet service by the end of 2021 to some of Earth's northern regions, including Canada, Alaska, Greenland, Iceland and continental northern Europe. Full global service is expected to commence in 2022.</p>
			<p>The company has some competition in the satellite-internet business. For example, SpaceX has launched more than 1,700 of its Starlink broadband spacecraft to low Earth orbit and is already beta-testing the service they provide. Another heavy hitter, Amazon, plans to loft more than 3,200 broadband satellites of its own, though none of them have launched to date.<br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/09/14/spacex-success-for-51-starlinks/<br>
			</p>
			<p>SpaceX has launched 51 of its Starlink satellites from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The launch happened at 11.55 pm (3.55am UTC on September 14th).</p>
			<p>The Version 1.5 satellites were launched into Polar orbits and have laser inter-satellite links.</p>
			<p>The Falcon 9 booster supporting this mission previously launched Telstar 18 Vantage, Iridium-8, and seven Starlink missions.</p>
			<p>Following stage separation, SpaceX landed flawlessly Falcon 9&rsquo;s first stage on the &lsquo;Of Course I Still Love You&rsquo; droneship, which was stationed in the Pacific Ocean. One half of Falcon 9&rsquo;s fairing halves previously supported NROL-108 and the other previously flew on GPS III-3 and Turksat-5A.<br>

			<p><b><i>KDDI to use Starlink for mobile backhaul<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://telecoms.com/511313/kddi-to-use-starlink-for-mobile-backhaul/<br>
			</p>
			<p>KDDI has contracted Starlink to provide satellite-based backhaul for mobile base station sites to remote areas.</p>
			<p>Under the terms of the deal, the satellite company will hook up 1,200 remote mobile towers for KDDI, ready for use as early as next year.</p>
			<p>The telco market will likely be an important revenue stream for Elon Musk&rsquo;s Starlink, which has made headlines in recent years by launching thousands of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites into space in a bid to achieve global coverage; it&rsquo;s getting there. Much of the attention to date has focused on the firm&rsquo;s consumer play, which is currently a beta offering serving 100,000 users, but those users are not &#150; yet &#150; bringing in sufficient revenues.</p>
			<p>In June, in an interview in which he was fairly candid about the perilous financial position of the satellite industry, Musk told Mobile World Congress attendees that Starlink is working hard to bring down the cost of the dish users require to access its services, since it is currently absorbing a US$500-plus shortfall on each one.</p>
			<p>In addition, with users paying around $100 per month for the service, the company will need to sign up a lot of customers before it can start thinking about making a return on its hefty investments; Musk puts the firm&rsquo;s spend at $5 billion-$10 billion by the time it turns cash flow positive, possibly rising to the $20 billion-$30 billion region over time.</p>
			<p>Enter the telcos.</p>
			<p>Musk noted that Starlink can offer backhaul services to telcos, as well as potentially providing all of the connectivity for their rural customers to help them meet coverage targets. He revealed the firm had already signed partnership deals with two major global telecoms operators, but said they had declined to be named, and that it was in talks with a number of other telcos. It is likely that KDDI was one of the above.</p>
			<p>Indeed, on announcing the Starlink deal, the Japanese operator said it is already in receipt of an experimental licence from the country&rsquo;s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) to operate the ground station for the Starlink service at KDDI&rsquo;s Yamaguchi Satellite Communication Centre. Further, the pair have been carrying out technical trials to evaluate the performance of the service.</p>
			<p>KDDI said it aims to use Starlink to offer an urban mobile connectivity experience &#150; where towers are connected by fibre &#150; to its rural mobile customers.</p>
			<p>That is surely a goal for many telecoms companies. The KDDI deal could well be the first of many for Starlink, as operators look to utilise satellite technology, particularly the lower latency and higher speeds facilitated by LEO satellites, rather than compete with it at a retail level.</p>
			<p>And Starlink is not the only satellite firm attracting big name telco customers. Rival OneWeb has struck a deal with AT&amp;T to boost connectivity for business customers in remote and hard-to-reach locations in the US, while also connecting up the telco&rsquo;s mobile towers in similar places.</p>
			<p>That&rsquo;s two major telco satellite deals in less than a week, and it&rsquo;s safe to say there will be more to come.<br>

			<p><b><i>RAAF, UNSW satellite separates to conduct deeper space research<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://australianaviation.com.au/2021/09/raaf-unsw-satellite-separates-to-conduct-deeper-space-research/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The M2 mission, completed in collaboration between the Royal Australian Air Force and UNSW Canberra, has reached its latest milestone, with its 6U CubeSat successfully separating into two parts over the weekend to continue deeper space research.</p>
			<p>Following its launch from New Zealand in March this year, and under the control of UNSW Canberra, the M2 has now split into two smaller CubeSats  (M2-A and M2-B) and will now continue to orbit in formation flying.</p>
			<p>According to the RAAF and UNSW Canberra, formation flying enables them to conduct research into satellite control mechanisms, space domain awareness, and inter-satellite communications.</p>
			<p>According to the Air Vice-Marshal Cath Roberts, the M2 mission is Australia&rsquo;s &ldquo;most complex&rdquo; CubeSat &#150; miniature satellite &#150; mission.</p>
			<p>Russell Boyce, director of UNSW Canberra Space, said on LinkedIn the separation occurred at 2:55pm Canberra time on Friday.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;A careful drift will be followed by formation stabilisation employing LEO aerodynamics, and then it will be time for next steps,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>The two newly separated satellites will be able to communicate with each other as well as ground stations back here on earth, giving better quality data, with greater detail and less lag time.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This collaboration allows small satellites to be used for evaluation of technologies that may eventually be placed onto more complex space systems, such as large communications or earth observation satellites,&rdquo; AVM Roberts said.</p>
			<p>She said the initiation of formation flying is a milestone for the defence space domain, as the separation will allow for deeper &ldquo;on-orbit research&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The two satellites are packed with payloads such as optical telescopes, which are informing future Defence surveillance concepts,&rdquo; she added.</p>
			<p>Courtney Bright, UNSW Canberra&rsquo;s flight operations lead announced the achievement on LinkedIn, and said the move has been in the making for a long time.</p>
			<p>She captured two photos of the CubeSats 17 seconds after the separation, which she said was a &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; of its own.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We had to juggle large uncertainties in the physical separation time, the drift rate of the two spacecraft, separation-induced rotation, as well as lighting conditions when we were constrained to execute the separation approaching eclipse,&rdquo; Bright said.</p>
			<p>Each of the CubeSats are equipped with advanced radios and telescopes to gather remote sensing information.</p>
			<p>Significantly, they can process information through advanced artificial intelligence techniques, which can be reconfigured during flight.</p>
			<p>The UNSW Canberra team was able to successfully perform in-space AI using on-board computing as part of this next step &#150; an Australian first.</p>
			<p>Further, satellite was almost entirely designed and built in Australia in a collaboration between Air Force, UNSW Canberra Space, and a domestic supply chain of Australian companies.</p>
			<p>Air Commodore Philip Gordon said UNSW Canberra engaged with around 30 Australian companies for the M2 mission.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;M2 is not only significant for Defence&rsquo;s space domain, but also for advancing Australia&rsquo;s burgeoning space industry,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is an example of the world-class space capabilities on offer by Australian industry and academia &#150; showcasing their depth of talent, ingenuity and collaborative spirit.&rdquo;<br>

				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Hughes_and_OneWeb_announce_agreements_for_low_earth_Orbit_satellite_service_in_US_and_India_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>Hughes Network Systems, LLC (HUGHES), an innovator in satellite and multi-transport technologies and networks for 50 years, and OneWeb, the low Earth orbit satellite communications company, has announced that they have signed a distribution agreement in the U.S. focused on enterprise services. In India, the parties have entered into an MOU for a strategic agreement to distribute services to large enterprises, small and medium businesses, government, telcos and ISPs in the rural and remote parts of the country.</p>
			<p>Services will be offered by Hughes Network Systems, LLC, and Hughes Communications India Private Ltd., respectively. Hughes and OneWeb intend to work together to broaden distribution globally, with Hughes to offer OneWeb's low-latency, high-speed connectivity for markets such as enterprise, government, commercial aviation and maritime, cellular backhaul, and community Wi-Fi hotspots.</p>
			<p>Pradman Kaul, President, Hughes, said: &quot;The future of connectivity depends on a worldwide network of multiple transports, including terrestrial, geostationary and low Earth orbit satellite services. OneWeb's system enhances the Hughes portfolio of networking capabilities, introducing a low-latency option with global reach that complements GEO satellite capacity density and capability to meet our customers' needs. As a case in point, in India which has been starved of high-throughput satellite services, the OneWeb services will help us meet the tremendous backhaul and broadband demand.&quot;</p>
			<p>Neil Masterson, Chief Executive officer, OneWeb, said: &quot;OneWeb is thrilled to be working with Hughes to offer our connectivity solution across the U.S. and India. This agreement is another example of our commitment to deliver high-quality, continuous internet access to areas in need including in rural and remote areas of the U.S and India. Hughes is already an important investor and an invaluable technology partner, and I look forward to continuing to grow our relationship further.&quot;</p>
			<p>At a jointly hosted session at Satellite 2021, the conference and exhibition event held at National Harbor, Maryland, representatives of the companies signed the new agreements, addressed their ongoing partnership, and shared a demonstration of multi-orbit connectivity in action. The test, recorded on August 26, featured the successful real-time, seamless switching between the Hughes JUPITER 2 geostationary, high-throughput satellite (HTS) and OneWeb's low-latency, high-speed LEO constellation.</p>
			<p>The demonstration highlighted advantages of each type of connectivity as Hughes ActiveTechnologies software instantaneously evaluated the type of traffic and transmitted it over the most efficient path: latency-sensitive activities (like fast-twitch video gaming and a video call) were transmitted via OneWeb; bandwidth-intensive activities like video streaming were transmitted via JUPITER HTS.</p>
			<p>This agreement expands an established relationship between the two companies. Hughes, through its parent company EchoStar, is an investor in OneWeb. It is also an ecosystem partner to OneWeb, developing gateway electronics and the core module that will power every user terminal for the system. And Hughes is the prime contractor on an agreement with the U.S. Air Force Research Lab to integrate and demonstrate managed LEO SATCOM using OneWeb capacity in the Arctic region.</p>
			<p>OneWeb works with carefully selected distribution partners in each of its core markets, providing new business and expansion opportunities through the low latency, global, high throughput attributes of OneWeb's network.</p>
			<p>OneWeb is building its initial constellation of 648 LEO satellites. Services will begin this year to the Arctic region including Alaska, Canada, and the UK. By late 2022 OneWeb will be offering its high-speed, low latency connectivity services globally. Service testing on the satellites already in orbit is underway, using gateways that Hughes is building for the network. Results are positive, including seamless satellite and beam handovers, high speeds and low latency.</p>
			<p>To help meet demand for broadband, Hughes is developing its next generation JUPITER 3 Ultra-High Density Satellite, expected to launch in the second half of 2022.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/09/10/china-cmg-acquires-olympics-rights-to-2032/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced that the China Media Group (CMG) has been awarded the exclusive broadcast rights in the Chinese mainland and Macau (SAR) for the XXV Olympic Winter Games in Milano Cortina in 2026, the Games of the XXXIV Olympiad in Los Angeles in 2028, the XXVI Olympic Winter Games in 2030, and the Games of the XXXV Olympiad in Brisbane in 2032.</p>
			<p>CMG has acquired the rights across all broadcast platforms, including free-to-air television, subscription television, internet and mobile. The agreement also includes the right to broadcast all editions of the Youth Olympic Games until 2032.</p>
			<p>The new agreement was signed during a virtual ceremony between IOC President Thomas Bach and CMG President Shen Haixiong.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The IOC is delighted to announce an extension to our agreement with our longstanding broadcast partner, CMG&rdquo; said IOC President Thomas Bach. &ldquo;The new agreement means Chinese sports fans will be able to continue enjoying CMG&rsquo;s first-class coverage of the Olympic Games through to 2032. I would like to congratulate CMG for the overwhelming success of its coverage of the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, when it reached hundreds of millions of people.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The IOC redistributes over 90 per cent of all its revenues to support athletes and sports organisations around the world. In these times of crisis, this support and solidarity are more important now than ever.</p>
			<p>Shen Haixiong, CMG President, commented: &ldquo;CMG and the IOC enjoy long-term friendly cooperation. CMG sent a team of nearly 800 people to the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020. The team made contributions to the success of the Olympic Games under special circumstances through CMG&rsquo;s coverage and supporting OBS&rsquo;s world feed productions. This displayed CMG&rsquo;s support for the Olympic Movement. The renewal of the Olympic Games broadcast rights in China will not only extend the partnership between the two sides, but also create a solid basis for widespread, continuous promotion of the Olympic Movement in China.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>According to Shen Haixiong, CMG&rsquo;s CCTV Olympic Channel, which will be the world&rsquo;s first 4K+HD, 7/24 TV channel, will be launched this year, along with the digital platforms of the CCTV Olympic Channel. This will be another key accomplishment in the cooperation between CMG and the IOC. It will facilitate the promotion of the Olympic Movement and the Olympic values in China and create a great atmosphere for the upcoming Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 to &ldquo;encourage 300 million Chinese to engage in winter sports,&rdquo; said Shen Haixiong.</p>
			<p>CMG will broadcast the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 in China with new innovations, including 8K transmission, and also support Olympic Broadcast Services&rsquo; production of the world feed.</p>
			<p>CMG already has an agreement to broadcast the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 and the Olympic Games Paris 2024. The group (previously known as CCTV) has broadcast the Olympic Games through its agreement with the Asia Broadcast Union since the 1980s, and first acquired rights directly from the IOC for the Olympic Games Beijing 2008.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.gisborneherald.co.nz/local-news/20210910/engaged-to-launch-satellite-constellation/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab yesterday announced a contract to deploy an entire satellite constellation across five dedicated Electron missions.</p>
			<p>The launches are for Kin&eacute;is, a global Internet-of-Things (IoT) connectivity provider and scheduled for launch beginning in the second quarter of 2023, from Mahia. The constellation will enable Kin&eacute;is, a company backed by private and public investors &#151; including the French government's space agency CNES (Centre National d'&Eacute;tudes Spatiales) and CLS (Collecte Localisation Satellites), an international space-based solutions provider &#151; to improve its global IoT connectivity.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We're thrilled to be Kin&eacute;is' launch partner and look forward to delivering their constellation across five dedicated missions in quick succession,&rdquo; Rocket Lab chief executive Peter Beck said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Deploying an entire constellation and having it operational quickly requires each satellite to be deployed to exactly the right orbit.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Kin&eacute;is currently operates the Argos system, an international scientific collaboration between CNES, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), to monitor wildlife, fisheries, and to collect data about Earth's climate and environment through CLS.</p>
			<p>Kin&eacute;is' new constellation will complete the current system with more powerful 30kg-class nanosats that integrate IoT technology and a ship-tracking Automatic Identification System (AIS). Once deployed, this technology will allow Kin&eacute;is to expand across multiple industries and scale from 20,000 devices connected to millions.</p>
			<p>In addition to these missions, Rocket Lab will further contribute to the international Argos system with another upcoming Electron launch. Rocket Lab is the launch provider for the Argos-4 mission for General Atomics, which is developing the satellite for the United States Space Force on behalf of NOAA. That mission is scheduled to launch in early 2022.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Argos is an international programme that collects data from thousands of sensors and transmitters located around the world. Currently, data is collected and distributed for use in numerous applications, including ocean buoy tracking, wildlife and fishery monitoring, and maritime security, as well as non-environmental uses,&rdquo; a General Atomics statement said.<br>

			<p><b><i>China launches ChinaSat-9B broadcast satellite<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacenews.com/china-launches-chinasat-9b-broadcast-satellite/<br>
			</p>
			<p>HELSINKI &#151; China conducted its 33rd launch of 2021 early Thursday, successfully sending the ChinaSat-9B communications satellite into geosynchronous transfer orbit.</p>
			<p>A Long March 3B lifted off from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center, southwest China, at 7:50 a.m. Eastern, September 9.</p>
			<p>The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. (CASC) announced ChinaSat-9B, also known as Zhongxing-9B, had entered its intended orbit within an hour of launch.</p>
			<p>ChinaSat-9B will provide live broadcast services, support 4K and 8K high-definition video program transmission using a specially designed  54MHz bandwidth transponder, and provide high-quality live broadcast transmission services for large-scale events, according to CASC.</p>
			<p>The satellite will be operated by CASC subsidiary China Satcom and provide communication services for emergency rescue and disaster relief.</p>
			<p>The satellite is based on the DFH-4E, an enhanced version of the established DFH-4 platform developed by China Academy of Space Technology (CAST), a major satellite manufacturing arm of CASC. The DFH-4E has a mass of around 5,500 kilograms and features hybrid electric- and chemical-propulsion.</p>
			<p>CASC states that China Satcom manages and operates 15 satellites in orbit, including ChinaSat and Apstar series satellites. Zhongxing-9B will replace Zhongxing-9A. </p>
			<p>The latter launched in June 2017 but a third stage anomaly left the satellite in a lower orbit than planned. This required Zhongxing-9A to use its own propellant for 10 orbital adjustments to raise itself into geostationary orbit at 101.4 degrees East and in doing so greatly reduced its planned 15-year lifetime. </p>
			<p>A Chinese news report in February stated that the satellite&rsquo;s propellant had been fully depleted, just over three and a half years after launch.</p>
			<p>The orbit of Zhongxing-9A has been raised 130 kilometers above geostationary orbit following its end of service. This is however short of the 300-kilometer raise needed to put ChinaSat-9A into an ideal GEO graveyard orbit.</p>
			<p>Space analyst Jonathan McDowell told SpaceNews that it may be the case that in raising the satellite to GEO enough propellant was not kept for the final retirement burn. McDowell notes that the satellite has drifted around the world since February and is once again over China. If the orbit of Zhongxing-9A is to be raised further, it would likely be during the next couple of weeks while the satellite is in view of Chinese groundstations.</p>
			<p>The first satellite based on the DFH-4E was Zhongxing-18 (ChinaSat-18). The satellite launched in August 2019 atop a Long March 3B launch vehicle but suffered unspecified anomalies and attempts to communicate with the satellite were unsuccessful. Zhongxing-18 remains in geosynchronous transfer orbit with a perigee of 147 kilometers.</p>
			<p>The Indonesian Nusantara-2 DFH-4E-based satellite was lost following a Long March 3B third stage issue in April 2020.</p>
			<p>China has attempted 33 launches so far in 2021. CASC has been successful with all 31 of its launches, with more than 40 planned in total this year by the state-owned giant.</p>
			<p>CASC is preparing to send the Tianzhou-3 cargo spacecraft to the Tianhe space station module within the next two weeks. The crewed Shenzhou-13 mission is planned to follow in October. </p>
			<p>The other two Chinese launches came from private firm iSpace, which has suffered two failures of its Hyperbola-1 light-lift solid rocket. Fellow private launch company Galactic Energy is meanwhile preparing to launch its second Ceres-1 solid rocket in October.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2179195/nt-looks-to-hire-thaicom-to-handle-satellite-systems<br>
			</p>
			<p>National Telecom (NT) is mulling hiring SET-listed satellite service provider Thaicom to handle the control systems of the Thaicom 4 and 6 satellites to ensure a smooth transition of operations, as Thaicom's 30-year concession is scheduled to end on Friday, says the Digital Economy and Society (DES) Ministry.</p>
			<p>Details of an agreement have yet to be concluded.</p>
			<p>After the concession ends, Thaicom has to hand over related assets of Thaicom 4 and 6 to NT, which was founded through the merger of CAT Telecom and TOT in January this year.</p>
			<p>Chaiwut Thanakamanusorn, the DES minister, said NT is ready to take over the assets of the satellites.</p>
			<p>&quot;NT will handle these assets and manage them with transparency by taking into account the interests of the state and the public,&quot; said Mr Chaiwut.</p>
			<p>The minister visited Thaicom's headquarters on Thursday to ensure services related to the two satellites will not be disrupted during the transition period.</p>
			<p>Thaicom's satellite control system centre in Nonthaburi as well as related equipment have been transferred to the ministry.</p>
			<p>Thaicom 4 is a broadband satellite and Thaicom 6 is a broadcasting satellite. Thaicom had a revenue-sharing concession with the DES Ministry.</p>
			<p>As the operational life of the two satellites extends beyond the term of the concession, the ministry has the right to operate them after the concession.</p>
			<p>The engineering life span of Thaicom 4 ends in 2023 and that of Thaicom 6 expires in 2029.</p>
			<p>The National Digital Economy and Society Committee recently resolved to assign NT to operate Thaicom 4 and 6 after the concession to ensure service will continue during the transition period.</p>
			<p>Thaicom's 30-year concession followed the build-transfer-operate model.</p>
			<p>The firm paid 13.7 billion baht in revenue sharing to the state from six satellites it has operated throughout the concession.</p>
			<p>The country is moving away from a concession model for satellite business to a licensing regime.</p>
			<p>The National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission previously planned to hold an auction for four satellite orbital slot packages on Aug 28, awarding licences for the right to use orbital slots.</p>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/09/10/hughes-oneweb-ink-us-india-leo-deals/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Satellite and multi-transport technologies and networks specialist Hughes Network Systems and low Earth orbit satellite communications company OneWeb have signed a distribution agreement in the US focused on enterprise services.</p>
			<p>In India, the parties have entered into an MOU for a strategic agreement to distribute services to large enterprises, small and medium businesses, government, telcos and ISPs, including in the rural and remote parts of the country. Services will be offered by Hughes Network Systems, LLC, and Hughes Communications India Private Ltd., respectively.</p>
			<p>Hughes and OneWeb intend to work together to broaden distribution globally, with Hughes to offer OneWeb&rsquo;s low-latency, high-speed connectivity for markets such as enterprise, government, commercial aviation and maritime, cellular backhaul, and community Wi-Fi hotspots.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The future of connectivity depends on a worldwide network of multiple transports, including terrestrial, geostationary and Low Earth Orbit satellite services,&rdquo; stated Pradman Kaul, President, Hughes. &ldquo;OneWeb&rsquo;s system enhances the Hughes portfolio of networking capabilities, introducing a low-latency option with global reach that complements GEO satellite capacity density and capability to meet our customers&rsquo; needs. As a case in point, in India which has been starved of high-throughput satellite services, the OneWeb services will help us meet the tremendous backhaul and broadband demand.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;OneWeb is thrilled to be working with Hughes to offer our connectivity solution across the US and India,&rdquo; added Neil Masterson, Chief Executive Officer, OneWeb. &ldquo;This agreement is another example of our commitment to deliver high-quality, continuous internet access to areas in need including in rural and remote areas of the US and India. Hughes is already an important investor and an invaluable technology partner, and I look forward to continuing to grow our relationship further.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>At a jointly-hosted session at Satellite 2021 at National Harbor, Maryland, representatives of the companies signed the new agreements, addressed their ongoing partnership, and shared a demonstration of multi-orbit connectivity in action.</p>
			<p>The test, recorded on August 26th, featured the successful real-time, seamless switching between the Hughes JUPITER 2 geostationary, high-throughput satellite (HTS) and OneWeb&rsquo;s low latency, high speed LEO constellation. The demonstration highlighted advantages of each type of connectivity as Hughes ActiveTechnologies software instantaneously evaluated the type of traffic and transmitted it over the most efficient path: latency-sensitive activities (such as fast-twitch video gaming and a video call) were transmitted via OneWeb; bandwidth-intensive activities such as video streaming were transmitted via JUPITER HTS.</p>
			<p>The agreement expands an established relationship between the two companies. Hughes, through its parent company EchoStar, is an investor in OneWeb. It is also an ecosystem partner to OneWeb, developing gateway electronics and the core module that will power every user terminal for the system. And Hughes is the prime contractor on an agreement with the US Air Force Research Lab to integrate and demonstrate managed LEO SATCOM using OneWeb capacity in the Arctic region.</p>
			<p>OneWeb works with carefully selected distribution partners in each of its core markets, providing new business and expansion opportunities through the low latency, global, high throughput attributes of OneWeb&rsquo;s network.</p>
			<p>OneWeb is building its initial constellation of 648 LEO satellites. Services will begin later in 2021 to the Arctic region including Alaska, Canada, and the UK. By late 2022, OneWeb will be offering its high-speed, low latency connectivity services globally. Service testing on the satellites already in orbit is underway, using gateways that Hughes is building for the network. Results are positive, including seamless satellite and beam handovers, high speeds and low latency.</p>
			<p>To help meet demand for broadband, Hughes is developing its next generation JUPITER 3 Ultra-High Density Satellite, expected to launch in the second half of 2022.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Doordarshan Direct (DD) offers Indian viewers free-to-view channels on its DD FreeDish. Some 20 channels, previously available on India&rsquo;s various pay-TV platforms, are also broadcasting on DD FreeDish.</p>
			<p>Harit Nagpal, MD &amp; CEO at Tata Sky, says there are 20 channels that are still part of the pay bouquets of the pay-TV operators.</p>
			<p>TataSky, Airtel Digital TV and other pay-TV operators have complained officially to India&rsquo;s media regulator TRAI complaining about the changes. The problem for the pay-TV broadcasters is that the channels which have tapped into DD FreeDish are using a loophole in India&rsquo;s broadcast regulations which are designed to supervise access to channels by the country&rsquo;s DTH and cable operators.</p>
			<p>The temptation for channels that were perhaps struggling with very modest payments from the pay-TV sector (generally between one and five Rupees per subscriber depending on perceived appeal) is that they can gain more viewers from DD FreeDish which enjoys some 40 million subscribing homes.</p>
			<p>DD FreeDish now offers more than 150 channels.<br>

			<p>It also plans to expand the service to other parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
			<p>We first heard of CONNECTme back in 2018 which is essentially a satellite broadband service delivered by MEASAT, the same company that is responsible for providing the satellite platform for Astro. Fast forward to 2021, there is now more than 2,000 CONNECTme NOW sites across Malaysia according to the MEASAT&rsquo;s COO, Yau Chyong Lim.</p>
			<p>A bulk of them is located in Sarawak with 1,183 sites to date while 243 sites are currently in operation within Sabah with the rest are scattered throughout Peninsular Malaysia. Yau said that these sites, which are mainly located in areas not covered by 4G or fibre connectivity, are serving over 200,000 broadband connections.</p>
			<p>However, the company is currently working to increase the number of CONNECTme NOW sites to 3,000 in order to achieve 300,000 connections by the end of this year according to Yau. At the same time, MEASAT is also planning to expand its CONNECTme NOW service to unconnected areas in other countries within Southeast Asia.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, MEASAT is also busy preparing to launch MEASAT-3d which is expected to take place in early 2022. The new Airbus-made satellite will not only help the company recover the missing capacity caused by the retirement of MEASAT-3 but would also allow CONNECTme to deliver a higher broadband speed of up to 100Mbps. At the same time, the company also expects that the new satellite to cover 100% of the unconnected population in Malaysia.<br>

			<p><b><i>Amazon fires back at SpaceX in regulatory war of words over satellite constellations<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-fires-back-spacex-regulatory-war-words-satellite-constellations/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Amazon laid out out a laundry list of SpaceX&rsquo;s regulatory tussles today in a letter sent to the Federal Communications Commission, marking the latest chapter in a bare-knuckles battle over broadband satellite constellations.</p>
			<p>The letter &#151; written by C. Andrew Keisner, lead counsel for Amazon&rsquo;s multibillion-dollar Project Kuiper satellite project &#151; argues that SpaceX has run roughshod over regulatory requirements, and that SpaceX lambastes anyone who seeks to call the company to account.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or reopening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks,&rdquo; Keisner wrote.</p>
			<p>This comes in response to SpaceX&rsquo;s complaint last week that Amazon is &ldquo;more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay&rdquo; its competitors. We&rsquo;ve reached out to SpaceX for a response to today&rsquo;s letter, and will update this report with anything we hear back.</p>
			<p>The central issue in the war of words is SpaceX&rsquo;s request to amend its application for the next generation of its Starlink satellite constellation. SpaceX is already beta-testing its initial constellation of more than 1,600 satellites, and last month, it proposed two new options for placing tens of thousands of additional satellites in low Earth orbit.</p>
			<p>Amazon, meanwhile, is still working on its Project Kuiper concept. More than 500 employees are at work at Kuiper&rsquo;s facilities in Redmond, Wash. Antennas are being tested, and launch agreements are being struck &#151; but no satellites have yet been sent into orbit.</p>
			<p>Amazon objected to SpaceX&rsquo;s latest request, saying that it shouldn&rsquo;t have combined two potential deployment strategies in one proposal.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;To this simple problem, Amazon proposed a simple remedy: settle on a single constellation proposal (as all others do) and resubmit the amendment,&rdquo; Keisner wrote. &ldquo;Instead, SpaceX chose a more complicated path &#151; one that involves misinformation, ad hominem attacks, and a belief that it can influence regulators via social media.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>On Twitter, for example, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk took particular aim at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who stepped down from the company&rsquo;s CEO role in July. &ldquo;Turns out Besos retired in order to pursue a full-time job filing lawsuits against SpaceX,&rdquo; Musk wrote in a tweet that misspelled Bezos&rsquo; name. In another tweet, Musk joked that the solution might be to &ldquo;zap him on the head with our space lasers.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Today&rsquo;s footnote-laced letter touches on occasions when SpaceX and Musk&rsquo;s other main venture, Tesla, stirred up regulatory controversies &#151; including an unauthorized test launch of a SpaceX Starship prototype that ended in an explosion last year, questions about the construction of a Starship launch tower, Tesla&rsquo;s tiff over a shelter-in-place order during the coronavirus pandemic, SpaceX&rsquo;s lawsuits over launch contracts and a controversy over the design of Starlink antennas.</p>
			<p>Most of those cases were resolved to allow SpaceX and Tesla to move forward.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;If there is anything kind to say about SpaceX&rsquo;s approach, it is that it has been effective in achieving SpaceX&rsquo;s goal of avoiding both the rules and any sanction for flouting them,&rdquo; Keisner wrote. &ldquo;But SpaceX&rsquo;s run of success with this strategy may be coming to an end.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Keisner referred to last year&rsquo;s award of $885 million in federal subsidies to SpaceX for boosting rural broadband internet access. In the months since then, some complained that money from the subsidy program was going to areas that are already well-served with broadband, or to provide access in areas such as golf courses, traffic islands and parking lots.</p>
			<p>In July, the FCC sent a letter to SpaceX and scores of other subsidy recipients, giving them the opportunity to withdraw funding requests &ldquo;where significant questions of waste have been raised.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Keisner said the FCC&rsquo;s letter &ldquo;provides some hope that a change in SpaceX&rsquo;s results will prompt a change in its tactics.&rdquo; But he also issued a warning. &ldquo;If SpaceX and Musk continue to hold themselves above the rules, they should buckle up: they will only draw further protest from Amazon and others who want to see rules applied to everyone equally,&rdquo; he wrote.<br>

			<p><b><i>Space junk traffic dangers to be tackled by first-of-its-kind research centre in UK<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Space_junk_traffic_dangers_to_be_tackled_by_first_of_its_kind_research_centre_in_UK_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>New ways of tackling the threat that space junk in our skies poses are being explored by University of Warwick scientists, as they pioneer new research that could help the UK fulfil its ambition to become a responsible spacefaring nation.</p>
			<p>Scientists at a new Centre for Space Domain Awareness are to focus attention on threats to the technology filling the skies above our heads in anticipation of a huge expansion in the number of satellites that provide vital services such as communications, navigation and Earth observation.</p>
			<p>The University of Warwick is launching the Centre for Space Domain Awareness to create a critical mass of research that tackles the growing threats to technology in Earth orbit. From the space junk that could collide with orbiting satellites, to the solar winds that could interfere with their electronics, the researchers at the new Centre will pioneer new work to understand and characterise the near-Earth environment to support scientific, commercial, governmental and military applications.</p>
			<p>Supported by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) and UKSA, the new Centre for Space Domain Awareness will be the first research centre in the UK dedicated to investigating the sustainable use of the near-Earth environment. The Centre is launched today (8 September) at the annual meeting of GNOSIS (The Global Network on Sustainability in Space), a Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) network of scientists and representatives from industry that aims to raise awareness of the problem of space debris and of space sustainability.</p>
			<p>Professor Don Pollacco, Director of the new Centre and Professor in the University of Warwick Department of Physics, said: &quot;The near-Earth environment is becoming increasing important, and yet we don't know that much about what's really going on there. At the Centre for Space Domain Awareness, we'll be concentrating on studying the solar wind and its impact on satellites and the Earth's atmosphere, and on the debris situation in all orbital regimes and its impact on spacecraft.</p>
			<p>&quot;Both those areas have become important, especially in terms of the UK's ambition to become a spacefaring country, and the responsibility that entails.&quot;</p>
			<p>Since the start of space exploration around 6,000 satellites have been launched into orbit and that number is expected to increase massively, particularly with plans from some organisations for 'mega-constellations' of thousands of satellites.</p>
			<p>Most of these are found in low-Earth orbit (LEO), less than ~1200km, as these orbits have become routinely (and relatively cheaply) accessible from the ground and are the ideal distance to obtain short latency for communications and high-resolution imagery.</p>
			<p>While our satellites are key to the space-for-Earth industries such as telecommunications and internet infrastructure (including banking) and Earth Observation, the near-Earth environment has become littered with debris from multiple space launches, as well as decommissioned spacecraft that have been left to burn up in the atmosphere. The scientists at the University of Warwick have been working to develop new ways to search for debris in orbit through projects such as DebrisWatch, as well as investigating how the solar wind, given off by our Sun, can affect the operations of spacecraft.</p>
			<p>Professor Pollacco added: &quot;The bulk of modern society is dependent on space. But we now have a space traffic issue. Sooner or later, this is all going to become a big issue. From our point of view, the idea is to get onto it a lot earlier.</p>
			<p>&quot;In terms of debris, we don't know about the distribution with orbital height but we know that there are some orbits that have significant debris in. The material is moving quite fast, and its momentum can be significant. Something very small can take out a whole spacecraft.</p>
			<p>&quot;We also want to study the impact of charged build-up from the solar wind on spacecraft electronics.&quot;</p>
			<p>Jacob Geer, Head of Space Surveillance and Tracking at the UK Space Agency, said: &quot;Without satellites, we wouldn't be able to connect with our families at the touch of a button or check the weather before leaving the house. As we become increasingly reliant on these services, the threat of space debris could cause havoc for our day-to-day activities.</p>
			<p>&quot;This centre will support the UK's growing need to track objects in space and shows how active our universities are in tackling space debris. We should see many civil and military benefits from this research as we look at ways to reduce and tackle the increasing congestion in space.&quot;</p>
			<p>Jason Green, STFC Associate Director External Innovation, said: &quot;Using research-based expertise to solve some of society's most pressing problems is the main aim of the STFC networks, such as GNOSIS.</p>
			<p>&quot;The GNOSIS network has provided the catalyst for this new centre, which will no doubt enhance the UK's expertise in this area.</p>
			<p>&quot;The centre will utilise STFC's experience in applying techniques from our research portfolio to tackle real-world challenges, along with the commercial connections developed within the GNOSIS network.&quot;</p>
			<p>Dr William Feline, Space Situational Awareness Project Technical Authority at Dstl, said: &quot;Dstl has been working with Professor Pollacco and his team for a number of years in tackling the challenge of understanding how best to monitor satellites and debris in Earth orbit. The unique capabilities that they have brought to bear on the problem, including their world-class observatory facilities on La Palma in the Canary Islands, have rapidly accelerated the UK's capabilities in this area. As a result, Dstl recently sponsored a Fellowship in Space Situational Awareness at the University of Warwick. I'm really pleased to witness the growth in UK expertise which has helped lead to the creation of this new Centre and I'm looking forward to working with them on the challenges faced by the UK and the world.&quot;</p>
			<p>Katherine Courtney, Chair of the GNOSIS Board, said: &quot;The volume of space traffic is increasing at a pace unimaginable just a few years ago. Nations and companies all over the world have growing ambitions for new space missions. The risks posed to those spacecraft from space weather, congestion and debris are a global concern.</p>
			<p>&quot;The Global Network on Sustainability in Space (GNOSIS) brings together scientists and industry to solve problems of how to safeguard the sustainable use of space for all. This new Centre for Space Domain Awareness being announced will help accelerate progress in understanding the nature and scale of the problems and will generate fresh insights into how to combat those. We are pleased GNOSIS has been able to play a role in the Centre's formation and look forward to its future success.&quot;<br>

			<p>Vodafone Introduces &ldquo;WaqaSAT&rdquo;, satellite internet solution for Maritime vessels. Picture: VODAFONE FIJI</p>
			<p>Vodafone Fiji has launched WaqaSAT which is set to provide cost effective and reliable internet connectivity for maritime vessels, operating within Fijian waters and beyond.</p>
			<p>According to the company WaqaSAT is the company&rsquo;s satellite internet connectivity solution which would keep seafarers connected while they are out at sea.</p>
			<p>It covers the bleak areas of the map allowing friends and family to be in contact with loved ones and sharing experience in real time.</p>
			<p>According to Vodafone WaqaSAT was designed to offer high-speed internet connectivity for browsing the web, uploading photos, streaming videos, downloading content and most importantly, another avenue to connect during emergencies.</p>
			<p>Vodafone stated it was powered by Kacific Satellites as the solution was a new addition to the portfolio of Vodafone&rsquo;s satellite-based solutions.</p>
			<p>It was delivered through reliable satellite internet beams throughout Fiji, with the setup being simple and cost effective, thereby making it highly affordable and accessible.</p>
			<p>The company said a special satellite dish, purposefully designed for maritime operations was installed on the vessel, with auto polling antennas to stay connected to satellite beams, providing consistent internet connectivity.</p>
			<p>Vodafone Fiji said it provided end to end complementary solution to extend Wi-Fi coverage throughout the vessel and to connect to other equipment on board as this could become seafarers, vessel owners and travellers most important service.</p>

			<p><b><i>Chang Zheng 4C lifts Gaofen-5-02 satellite to orbit<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/09/garden-5-02/<br>
			</p>
			<p>On Tuesday, September 7 China launched the second Gaofen-5 remote imagery satellite into a 705 km sun-synchronous orbit (SSO). The launch took place at 03:01 UTC on a Chang Zheng 4C and was conducted from Launch Complex 9 at the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in China.</p>
			<p>The first launch attempt on Monday was scrubbed due to an unknown reason.</p>
			<p>Gaofen-5&rsquo;s purpose is hyperspectral observation of Earth&rsquo;s environments to track environmental impacts, water quality, and atmospheric changes.</p>
			<p>The satellite bus is the SAST3000 and carries seven instruments that can observe the spectrum from infrared to ultraviolet and can measure atmospheric data in 15 different channels.</p>
			<p>The Gaofen-5 satellites, which first launched in May 2018, are part of the overall Gaofen family of satellites that are themselves part of the CHEOS program. The program was proposed in 2006 and approved and initiated by the Chinese government in 2010, which led to the creation of the Earth Observation System and Data Center of the China National Space Administration (EOSDC-CNSA).</p>
			<p>The goal of the program is to improve the capabilities of Chinese Earth imagery systems in sectors like ocean monitoring, disaster studies, environmental monitoring, and forecasting.</p>
			<p>The first Gaofen (Gao fen = high resolution) launch was conducted in April 2013 on a Chang Zheng 2D. Since then, 21 more Gaofen launches have taken place, with the last one being the Gaofen 12 launch in March 2021.</p>
			<p>The Chang Zheng 4C rocket that launched Tuesday&rsquo;s mission stood 45.8 meters tall with a diameter of 3.35 meters. Its liftoff mass was approximately 250,000 kg across three stages.</p>
			<p>The Chang Zheng 4C (CZ-4C, or Long March 4C as it is known internationally) is mainly used for low Earth orbit (LEO) and SSO missions.</p>
			<p>The first stage of the rocket is 27.91 meters long and has a mass of 182,000 kg, more than two-thirds of the liftoff mass. It is powered by four YF-21C engines which run on dinitrogen tetroxide and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine.</p>
			<p>The hypergolic mixture produces a liftoff thrust of 2.971 kN with a specific impulse at sea level of 259 seconds.</p>
			<p>On top of the first stage sits the second stage, which runs on the same hypergolic fuels as the first stage. It has a length of 10.9 meters with thrust produced by a single YF-24C engine &#151; which contains a YF-22C main engine and four YF-23C vernier engines for steering.</p>
			<p>Gaofen 5 02 during pre-launch testing. (Credit: China National Space Administration)</p>
			<p>The main engine produces a thrust of 742 kN and a specific impulse of 299 seconds. The four vernier engines have a thrust of 47 kN.</p>
			<p>The last stage also uses the same fuel mixture as the previous stages and is 14.79 meters in length with a diameter of 2.9 meters. It is powered by the YF-40 engine, which is a gas generator cycle upper stage engine originally built for the Chang Zheng 1D second stage.</p>
			<p>The engine was later repurposed as the third stage for the Chang Zheng 4C. The engine can run up to 412 seconds and produces 100 kN of thrust. It has a specific impulse of 303 seconds in vacuum and allows the stage to place its payloads into the intended orbit(s).</p>
			<p>Overall, the Chang Zheng 4C has a success rate of 94% and is capable of launching up to 4,200 kg into LEO and 2,800 kg into SSO. The last failure occurred in May 2019 during the Weixing-33 mission.</p>
			<p>After a nominal performance of the first and second stages, the third stage had an unknown failure and the payload did not reach orbit. A replacement satellite was launched only one year later.</p>
			<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s flight lifted off from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in Shanxi Province in northern China. It was founded in 1966 and is used to launch many vehicles of the Chang Zheng family, including the Chang Zheng 1, 4, and 6.</p>

			<p>Officially, the site is used to launch meteorological and scientific payloads into polar orbits and as a test area for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM).</p>
			<p>Taiyuan hosts a technical area for the integration of rockets and payloads as well as communication, infrastructure, and launch complex support.</p>
			<p>This was the 10th mission of the Chang Zheng 4 this year, the 32nd orbital launch for China in 2021, and the 36th mission of Chang Zheng 4C.<br>

			</p>
			<p>The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has developed a satellite for pursuing sustainable development.</p>
			<p>The satellite, SDGSAT-1, has already passed the round-the-clock and multi-load coordinated observation. It is expected to provide advanced, open and shared data resources for monitoring and evaluating the sustainable development index representing the interaction between human and nature.</p>
			<p>The International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was inaugurated in Beijing on Monday to support the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The development and operation of the SDGSAT-1 are among the main missions of this newly established research center, said Guo Huadong, an academician with the CAS.</p>
			<p>The satellite has three payloads of thermal infrared, low light level and multispectral imager, with 300 km wide data acquisition capability. It can achieve global coverage within 11 days.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/paralympics/126288486/paralympics-new-zealand-seeking-tv-coverage-solution-for-paris-2024<br>
			</p>
			<p>Paralympics New Zealand chief executive Fiona Allan is looking to sort better TV coverage for the next Games in Paris.</p>
			<p>The boss of Paralympics New Zealand (PNZ) concedes they are seeking solutions to the chaotic TV coverage which plagued this year&rsquo;s Games in Tokyo.</p>
			<p>And, for the next Games, in Paris in 2024, that could mean a &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; model between free-to-air and paid subscription, as viewer demands for para sport rise to unprecedented levels.</p>
			<p>Complaints have flown thick and fast throughout the event about the broadcasting from TVNZ, with their seeming lack of feel, or planning, resulting in a lack of air-time for Kiwi athletes, notably when some were right in the thick of finals.</p>
			<p>Some of the blame has been directed at the host broadcaster in Tokyo, with no flexibility to alter what is sent on that live feed, though much of the fan frustration has been with TVNZ&rsquo;s decision not to offer pop-up channels, and their messy livestreams.</p>
			<p>Speaking from Tokyo, as the curtain came down on New Zealand&rsquo;s 12-medal campaign, PNZ chief executive Fiona Allan revealed to Stuff that sorting the TV troubles ahead of Paris 2024 loomed large on the national body&rsquo;s to-do list.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Following these Games we&rsquo;ll be needing to reassess the broadcast of Paralympic Games... and look to see what we can do at Paralympics New Zealand to work with a host broadcaster to really maximise our coverage that our New Zealand public demands,&rdquo; Allan said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I think what we may ideally look at is a hybrid solution of free-to-view and paid subscription.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We really appreciate the opportunity for all New Zealanders to view Paralympic sport, regardless of whether you&rsquo;ve got to pay or not to do so.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;So I think looking at what the possibilities are for extended coverage.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Allan had last week publicly voiced her disappointment &ldquo;in some of the decisions made in cutting away from events featuring New Zealand Paralympians at important moments, or not showing certain competitions at all&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Rarely have the Paralympics been a pay-TV event in New Zealand, and at the last Games in Rio in 2016, the TVNZ and Attitude Pictures broadcast partnership, which was again in place this year, had been well-received.</p>
			<p>Allan noted the TV issue had probably also been accentuated by a very successful New Zealand Olympics, which had &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; wall-to-wall coverage on 12 Sky channels, along with the country being in Covid-19 alert levels 3 and 4, and therefore being at home, and with more time to tune in.</p>
			<p>Having been at the helm of the organisation since 2008, Allan was acutely aware just how important the TV coverage was in inspiring future para sport participants, and, in turn, future Paralympians, and she had definitely witnessed a big surge in interest in the Games by punters.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I think that it bodes really well for the future, with regards to an increased demand from the New Zealand public to see the excitement of Paralympic sport in the future,&rdquo; Allan said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;So we're really positive around how we now look towards ensuring more coverage of Paris 2024.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/09/03/spacex-responds-to-amazon-complaint/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Amazon, in a formal letter to the FCC on August 25th, objected to SpaceX&rsquo;s enhanced plan for almost 30,000 new Starlink satellites and their adjusted orbits.</p>
			<p>SpaceX, in a letter to the FCC, said &#150; in essence &#150; that Amazon&rsquo;s complaint is simply a delaying tactic. The company wrote: &ldquo;The FCC should recognise this delay tactic for what it is &#151; a continuation of efforts by the Amazon family of companies to hinder competitors to compensate for Amazon&rsquo;s failure to make progress of its own. While SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radio-frequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellation.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Amazon&rsquo;s recent missive is unfortunately only the latest in its continuing efforts to slow down competition, while neglecting to resolve the Commission&rsquo;s concerns about Amazon&rsquo;s own non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite system. The Commission should see through these efforts and quickly put SpaceX&rsquo;s application out for public comment where any issues can be fully vetted,&rdquo; added SpaceX.</p>
			<p>Then SpaceX raised the temperature, saying: &ldquo;The FCC issued an order in July 2020 informing Amazon that it had not provided sufficient information about how its proposed system would protect others from interference or meet the Commission&rsquo;s rules for orbital debris. But while Amazon has filed nothing with the Commission to address these conditions on its own licence for nearly 400 days, it took only 4 days to object to SpaceX&rsquo;s next-generation NGSO system. In fact, Amazon has not had a single meeting with the Commission this year about how it intends to resolve the Commission&rsquo;s interference or safety concerns, but it has had 15 meetings in that same span just about SpaceX. While Amazon has waited 15 months to explain how its system works, it has lodged objections to SpaceX on average about every 16 days this year.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/09/03/musk-swaps-capture-nets-for-recovery-ships/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Elon Musk has reportedly given up on catching his SpaceX rocket fairings with vessels and giant nets and instead is launching two new boats to the fleet specifically to recover fairings by fishing them out of the ocean.</p>
			<p>The two new ships are named as &lsquo;Bob&rsquo; and &lsquo;Doug&rsquo; after the first Demo 2 astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley. They are some 280-feet long, and much larger than the earlier fairing catcing vessels (at 205 ft in length).</p>
			<p>Musk&rsquo;s team has also used a new landing drone for the first time, &lsquo;A Shortfall of Gravitas&rsquo; which handled the landing of a Falcon 9 booster after it had launched a Dragon service cargo to the International Space Station.</p>
			<p>NASA Spaceflight says that having the two former &lsquo;net catching&rsquo; vessels was not efficient, hence the investments in Bob and Doug. SpaceX started conversion work on Bob and Doug in May last year transforming the ships from standard platform supply vessels being used to serve offshore platforms &#150; into a SpaceX recovery ships.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/09/03/thuraya-orders-new-satellite-from-airbus/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Airbus has won a contract from Al Yah Satellite Communications (Yahsat) to build its Thuraya 4-NGS. Airbus also has an option to build Thuraya&rsquo;s &lsquo;5-NGS&rsquo; craft.</p>
			<p>The satellite is described as being able to deliver higher capabilities and flexibility while increasing capacity and coverage across Europe, Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East, enabling next generation mobility solutions for all customer segments, including defence, government and businesses.</p>
			<p>The next generation craft will drive the continued advancement of Thuraya&rsquo;s L-band business. Based on the all-electric, Airbus Eurostar Neo platform, Thuraya 4-NGS will incorporate a large 12-meter L-band antenna and a payload, with on-board processing providing advanced routing flexibility of up to 3200 channels with dynamic power allocation over a large number of spot beams. The satellite is scheduled for operation in 2024.</p>
			<p>Thuraya says: &ldquo;This is a major milestone in Yahsat&rsquo;s move toward transforming Thuraya and rolling out their next-generation system, which entails a complete overhaul of the company&rsquo;s space and ground platforms, enabling a new set of services, products and solutions across a greater coverage area. The new capabilities will drive leadership across many strategic product lines, such as maritime, IoT, and data solutions offering a wide spectrum of throughput capabilities and the highest speeds available in the market, while reinforcing Thuraya&rsquo;s strengths in the MSS voice market.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>This latest commitment from Yahsat takes its total committed investment to date to well over $500 million, and more is anticipated in the coming years, including an option with Airbus to build Thuraya 5-NGS (an additional satellite identical to Thuraya 4-NGS), strengthening the firm&rsquo;s coverage and capabilities across the Asia Pacific region.</p>

			<p><b><i>The First 75 GHz Signals Are Sent From Space By The W-Cube Smallsat<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://news.satnews.com/2021/09/01/the-first-75-ghz-signals-are-sent-from-space-by-the-w-cube-smallsat/?mohide=true&amp;mc_cid=d1630f54b1&amp;mc_eid=e80892f101<br>
			</p>
			<p>The W-Cube smallsat is the first satellite that ESA has ordered from Finland and is part of ESA&rsquo;s ARTES project, which is coordinated by Joanneum Research in Austria. Reaktor Space Lab (RSL) developed and manufactured W-Cube&rsquo;s satellite platform. VTT designed, manufactured and tested the radio beacon system of W-Cube together with Germany&rsquo;s Fraunhofer IAF. The satellite signal is measured at both the main measuring station in Graz as well as a corresponding station at VTT in Espoo, Finland.</p>
			<p>The satellite is now modelling, for the first time ever, how a 75 GHz signal can penetrate the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. This opens possibilities for the use of the high millimeter wave frequency range in communications satellites in the future.</p>
			<p>A new frequency range and additional capacity will be needed already in the next few years when the number of data communication satellites increases and big flocks of satellites such as Starlink operated by SpaceX are deployed.</p>
			<p>The penetration through the atmospheric layers by the signal needs to be understood before the frequency range can be used. W-Cube&rsquo;s dual frequency radio beacon system sends a 75 GHz signal through the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere to the measuring ground stations.</p>
			<p>The data from the measurements helps in modelling how weather phenomena in space and in the atmosphere affect the signal propagation and polarization. In addition, W-Cube broadcasts a 37.5 GHz signal, making it possible to compare the information on measurements with previous models with a low frequency range. To save battery power, the beacon signals are only switched on when they can be detected by measuring stations in Europe. At other times, the satellite charges its batteries via the craft&rsquo;s solar panels. The satellite orbits the Earth approximately once every 1.5 hours and is visible to the Earth station (from horizon to horizon) for about 10 minutes at a time.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s lower frequency ranges are divided into narrow bands over which satellites and terrestrial radio links compete. Meanwhile, no bands in the high frequency range have been shared yet among the various applications. A free wide bandwidth enables rapid transfer of information and connections in, for example, the 5G and 6G networks and in remote areas such as Northern Finland. The European Space Agency ESA has a mission to offer these connections and in this way to invest in European competitiveness&rdquo;, says VTT&rsquo;s Senior Scientist, Jussi S&auml;ily. &ldquo;We also hope that this will help Finland get into more sizeable satellite programs. The project is of great significance in the development of both skills and knowledge, as well as testing facilities. A testing environment for satellites has taken shape in Otaniemi through collaboration involving VTT, Aalto University and commercial actors. Ensuring the spaceworthiness of the satellite has challenging terrestrial testing in environments including exposure to vacuum, heat, and vibration&rdquo;.,</p>
			<p>W-Cube was launched into space on June 30, 2021, from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle as one of the satellites on the Transporter 2 mission with 88 additional satellites. W-Cube was placed into orbit on July22, 2021, and the first contact between the satellite and the RSL ground station was established July 22 to 23.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This was followed by a deployment process in which we made sure that all of the systems were working as planned after the stress of the launch into space. That phase reached its climax today with the broadcast and reception of the 75 GHz signal. After reaching this milestone, the propagation of the signal in the atmosphere under different conditions and at different times of the year will be monitored for at least two years&rdquo;, said Jarkko Antila, CEO of Reaktor Space Lab<br>

			<p><b><i>NASA's Deep Space Network looks to the future<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/NASAs_Deep_Space_Network_looks_to_the_future_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>When NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover touched down on the Red Planet, the agency's Deep Space Network (DSN) was there, enabling the mission to send and receive the data that helped make the event possible. When OSIRIS-REx took samples of asteroid Bennu this past year, the DSN played a crucial role, not just in sending the command sequence to the probe, but also in transmitting its stunning photos back to Earth.</p>
			<p>The network has been the backbone of NASA's deep space communications since 1963, supporting 39 missions regularly, with more than 30 NASA missions in development. The team behind it is now working hard to increase capacity, making a number of improvements to the network that will help advance future space exploration.</p>
			<p>Managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the Space Communications and Navigation Program, based at NASA Headquarters within the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, the DSN is what enables missions to track, send commands to, and receive scientific data from faraway spacecraft.</p>
			<p>The network consists of tracking antennas across three complexes evenly spaced around the world at the Goldstone complex near Barstow, California; in Madrid, Spain; and in Canberra, Australia. In addition to supporting missions, the antennas are regularly used to conduct radio science - studying planets, black holes, and tracking near-Earth objects.</p>
			<p>&quot;Capacity is a big pressure, and our antenna-enhancement program is going to help that out. This includes the building of two new antennas, increasing our number from 12 to 14,&quot; said JPL's Michael Levesque, deputy director of the DSN.</p>
			<p>Network Upgrades<br>
				In January 2021, the DSN welcomed its 13th dish to the family. Named Deep Space Station 56 (DSS-56), this new 34-meter-wide (112-foot-wide) dish in Madrid is an &quot;all-in-one&quot; antenna. Previously constructed antennas are limited in the frequency bands they can receive and transmit, often restricting them to communicating with specific spacecraft. DSS-56 was the first to use the DSN's full range of communication frequencies as soon as it went online and can communicate with all the missions that the DSN supports.</p>
			<p>Soon after bringing DSS-56 online, the DSN team completed 11 months of critical upgrades to Deep Space Station 43 (DSS-43), the massive 70-meter (230-foot) antenna in Canberra. DSS-43 is the only dish in the Southern Hemisphere with a transmitter powerful enough, and that broadcasts the right frequency, to send commands to the distant Voyager 2 spacecraft, which is now in interstellar space. With rebuilt transmitters and upgraded facilities equipment, DSS-43 will serve the network for decades to come.</p>
			<p>&quot;The refresh of DSS-43 was a huge accomplishment, and we're on our way to take care of the next two 70-meter antennas in Goldstone and Madrid. And we've continued to deliver new antennas to address growing demand - all during COVID-19,&quot; said JPL's Brad Arnold, manager of the DSN.</p>
			<p>The improvements are part of a project to meet not just the heightened demand, but also evolving mission needs.</p>
			<p>Missions increasingly generate more data than in the past. The data rate from deep space spacecraft has grown by more than 10 times since the first lunar missions in the 1960s. As NASA looks toward sending humans to Mars, this need for higher data volumes will only increase further.</p>
			<p>Optical communications is one tool that can help meet this demand for higher data volumes by using lasers to enable higher-bandwidth communication. Over the next few years, NASA has several missions planned to demonstrate laser communications that will enhance the agency's ability to explore farther into space.</p>
			<p>New Approaches<br>
				The network is also focusing on new approaches to how it goes about its work. For instance, for most of the DSN's history, each complex was operated locally. Now, with a protocol called &quot;Follow the Sun,&quot; each complex takes turns running the entire network during their day shift and then hands off control to the next complex at the end of the day in that region - essentially, a global relay race that takes place every 24 hours.</p>
			<p>The resulting cost savings have been fed into antenna enhancements, and the effort has also strengthened the international cooperation between the complexes. &quot;Each site works with the other sites, not just during handover periods, but also on maintenance and how antennas are performing on any given day. We've really turned into a globally operating network,&quot; said Levesque.</p>
			<p>The network has also implemented new approaches to managing deep space communications. For instance, in the past, if multiple spacecraft circling Mars needed to be serviced at the same time, the network would have to point one antenna per spacecraft at Mars, potentially using all the antennas at a given complex. With a new protocol, the DSN can receive multiple signals from a single antenna and split them in the digital receiver. &quot;We adapted this from commercial telecommunication implementations to the benefit of our network efficiency,&quot; said Arnold.</p>
			<p>An additional new protocol allows operators to oversee multiple activities simultaneously. Traditionally, each spacecraft activity had a single dedicated operator. Now, the DSN uses an approach that leverages automation to allow each operator to oversee multiple spacecraft links simultaneously. For the first time, the DSN can now fully automate the sequencing and execution of tracking passes, and the effort will continue to be enhanced over time.</p>
			<p>&quot;The future of the DSN is going to follow the spirit and the drive of science missions that are flying out there. It's our responsibility to enable them. And we do that through communications,&quot; said Arnold.<br>

			<p><b><i>Gravity Media chosen by Supercars Eseries for technical infrastructure<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://mumbrella.com.au/gravity-media-chosen-by-supercars-eseries-for-technical-infrastructure-701392<br>
			</p>
			<p>Gravity Media has announced it has been selected by Supercars Eseries for its technical infrastructure and facilities.</p>
			<p>The announcement:</p>
			<p>    Gravity Media &#150; the leading global provider of complex live broadcast facilities and production services to content owners, creators and distributors &#150; has been chosen to deliver the technical infrastructure and facilities for the Cash Converters Supercars Eseries. Taking place on the iRacing platform from 25 August to 29 September, the Eseries offers fans a mix of Supercars main game drivers and elite sim racers, with teams competing for the top prize of more than $20,000.</p>
			<p>    Gravity Media&rsquo;s Production Centres in Melbourne (PCM) and Sydney (PCS) will service all the needs for the Eseries broadcast. PCS will act as the main hub, with a dedicated studio setup housing a 10m x 2.5m LED wall to display various feeds managed from the control room. At PCM, a single camera, commentary kit and 103&rdquo; Live Screen background will house the two main commentators &#150; with audio embedded onto separate tracks via the camera feed and sent via a direct fibre service to the Sydney facility.</p>
			<p>    A dedicated IP audio circuit between PCM and PCS will facilitate the live commentary, as well as accommodating production and technical communications between the two facilities.</p>
			<p>    In addition, due to government lockdowns in New South Wales, Gravity Media will supply communications to the remote support team for the gaming equipment. This will consist of an IP system enabling the remote team to speak directly to the director, producer and onsite operators from within the control room at PCS. For the remote drivers, Gravity Media will integrate cameras via Zoom to allow the producer to select individual drivers during the races and interview them afterwards through communications integrated into PCS via Discord.</p>
			<p>    The Eseries program will be sent through to FoxSports to be integrated on it Foxtel channel, Kayo on its IP sports platform and Network 7 for its IP service 7Plus. Gravity Media will also encode a live stream of the control room for feeds on Facebook, Twitch and YouTube.</p>
			<p>    &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very pleased to be working with Gravity Media on this event. The company&rsquo;s unparalleled experience and expertise in delivering high-quality broadcast infrastructures made it the perfect choice,&rdquo; said Nathan Prendergast, general manager &#150; television &amp; content at Supercars Australia. &ldquo;This project may have thrown up a few unexpected challenges, but we have no doubt this will be a fantastic event that delivers a top-quality experience for our fans.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>    &ldquo;Esports is continuing to grow rapidly, so we&rsquo;re delighted to be involved in such a high-profile event at this exciting time for the industry,&rdquo; said Ben Madgwick, Director of Media Services &amp; Facilities, Gravity Media Australia. &ldquo;Although the ongoing complexities of running a production in a COVID world &#150; particularly with recent local lockdowns &#150; presented some challenges to overcome, our team is well versed in adapting to any situation and providing innovative solutions that ensure the best possible delivery.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Southlanders embrace satellite broadband from Elon Musk's Starlink<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/digital-living/126246920/southlanders-embrace-satellite-broadband-from-elon-musks-starlink<br>
			</p>
			<p>Southland testers of Elon Musk&rsquo;s Starlink broadband are happy with their faster internet speeds.</p>
			<p>The SpaceX project plans to create a Starlink constellation of 12,000 satellites orbiting Earth, to bring improved broadband internet access to large swathes of the world&rsquo;s population.</p>
			<p>Multiple Southlanders signed up to be beta testers, including district councillor and Hokonui sheep and beef farmer Margie Ruddenklau.</p>
			<p>It made council Zoom meetings, streaming and virtual quiz nights with friends much easier, she said.</p>
			<p>Many areas of Southland have large patches without wireless connections, let alone fibre, such as between Winton, Dipton and Gore, people in the Mokotua and Gorge Road areas, and west of Mataura Island.</p>
			<p>The network meant fibre-like satellite connections that Southland deserved, Ruddenklau said.</p>
			<p>On the farm they needed to be online when weighing calves, and it made doing the business accounts much easier, she said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Starlink provides a solution for Southlanders, and New Zealanders, which finally allows them to get into the 21st century, which is very exciting.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>While Ruddenklau can only get patchy at best cell phone coverage at her house and farm, and has no fibre hookup, she and her family can now stream shows.</p>
			<p>Ruddenklau encouraged Southlanders in other dark spots to look into it.</p>
			<p>The cost of Starlink could be prohibitive for some, she said; $799 for the dish and other hardware, $114 for the shipping and handling and $159 per month for unlimited data.</p>
			<p>However, her house now got download speeds up to 150 megabits per second, whereas before &ldquo;on a good day&rdquo; they got five to 10 megabits.</p>
			<p>The Ruddenklaus were also getting 30 Mbps for uploads, compared to three to five Mbps previously, she said.</p>
			<p>She was also impressed by the connection's latency, the time it takes to send data from one point to the next.</p>
			<p>Starlink satellites are 60 times closer to Earth than traditional satellites, resulting in lower latency, the company says.</p>
			<p>There have been more than 20 Starlink launches to date, sending up to 60 new satellites into space at a time.</p>
			<p>People with a dish must have a clear view of the sky, and can use an app to position it.</p>
			<p>At the southern end of the district, Ruddenklau&rsquo;s fellow councillor Bruce Ford is also excited about what it would mean for people on Stewart Island.</p>
			<p>The professional fisheries, emergency services and mutton birders could all have better service, Ford said.</p>
			<p>He, too, signed up to be a beta tester.</p>
			<p>NZ Telecommunications Forum chief executive Paul Brislen said it would be good for any business in a remote location.</p>
			<p>Starlink could be very useful for those people who fell through the gaps of current services, but it was not the perfect solution for everyone, he said.</p>
			<p>About 85 per cent of houses and businesses in the country could currently get fibre, and there was an uptake of about 66 per cent at the moment, Brislen said.</p>
			<p>Network competition was good for the industry and the people, he said.<br>

			<p><b><i>Azerbaijan Considers Launching New Satellite into Orbit<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://caspiannews.com/news-detail/azerbaijan-considers-launching-new-satellite-into-orbit-2021-9-1-0/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Currently, Azercosmos operates three satellites, including Azerspace-1 and Azerspace-2 telecommunication satellites, and Azersky observation satellite. / Azercosmos</p>
			<p>Azerbaijan is exploring opportunities to launch another satellite into the Earth&rsquo;s orbit, the country&rsquo;s ministry of transport, communications, and high technologies reported on Tuesday.</p>
			<p>Azerbaijan&rsquo;s state-run satellite operator Azercosmos is currently conducting market research to study the feasibility of launching a remote sensing satellite.</p>
			<p>    &ldquo;Currently, intensive work is underway to use the resources of Azerspace-1, Azerspace-2, and Azersky satellites for more active commercial purposes,&rdquo; Report.Az quoted the ministry as saying.</p>
			<p>    &ldquo;At the same time, marketing research is being carried out to ensure the sustainability of Earth observation satellite services in our country. In this regard, Azercosmos is working to establish requirements for a new Earth observation system in Azerbaijan.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The ministry is now exploring options to operate the system as a group consisting of several small satellites.</p>
			<p>As part of the research, Azerbaijan can set up a modern center of satellite integration and testing to facilitate the launch of new satellites into orbit.</p>
			<p>Remote sensing allows observing and analyzing objects from a distance without being in direct contact with them. The most common remote sensing systems measure reflected visible light in addition to electromagnetic radiation that is invisible to the human eye, including ultraviolet (UV), infrared (IR), or microwave radiation. Remote sensors, which are usually mounted on satellites or aircraft, collect data by detecting the energy reflected from Earth.</p>
			<p>Azercosmos is the one and only satellite operator in the South Caucasus region. The state-owned company currently operates two telecommunication and one observation satellite. Azerspace-1 is the primary satellite of Azercosmos, providing highly reliable broadband and broadcast solutions to millions of people living in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. The satellite was launched in February 2013 and is equipped with 24 C-band transponders and 12 Ku-band transponders and is located at 46&deg; East longitude.</p>
			<p>Since December 2014, Azercosmos operates and commercializes Azersky, a high-resolution optical Earth observation satellite. In 2018, the third in general, but the second in the light of telecommunication satellites of Azercosmos - Azerspace 2 was sent into a geostationary orbit 45&deg; East longitude. It renders uninterrupted digital broadcasting, data transmission, and other services across Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Azerspace 2 is also used as a backup for Azerspace-1.</p>
			<p>In January-July 2021, Azercosmos exported satellite telecommunications services and optical satellite services worth $28.7 million to 31 countries. Revenues from the export generated 92 percent of the operator&rsquo;s total income. In July 2021, 24 countries paid $6.7 million for the services of the Azerbaijani satellites.</p>
			<p>The top buyers&rsquo; list in January-July 2021 includes the United States with $9.6 million, the United Kingdom with $5.8 million, France with $5.6 million, Malaysia with $3.7 million, and the United Arab Emirates with $1 million.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/09/01/disney-closing-hotstar-in-us/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Disney is to close down its Hotstar streaming service in the United States in late 2022, but has yet to confirm an end date. It is streamlining its streaming services by moving content over to Hulu and ESPN+.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The move from Hotstar, a premium brand for South Asian content, to ESPN+ and Hulu in the US, expands upon the rich and diverse catalogue of live events and stories delivered across the Disney Bundle and provides a platform for South Asian content to reach broader audiences,&rdquo; said Disney.</p>
			<p>Hulu will become the destination for entertainment content, which will include several thousand Hotstar specials and popular Bollywood/South Asian movies. Select Bollywood content will also be available on Hulu beginning September 1st, with thousands of additional movies and series episodes to be added in the future.</p>
			<p>ESPN+ will be showing live cricket events, including popular T20 cricket league VIVO IPL 2021 which resumes on September 19th, on ESPN+ in the US.</p>
			<p>Disney is hopeful that Hotstar users will then take up the Disney Streaming Bundle from September 1st. Hotstar US subscribers who don&rsquo;t currently take any other Disney streaming service will be eligible to receive the Disney Bundle (Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN+) through the end of their Hotstar annual subscription, rounded up to the end of the month, at no additional charge.</p>
			<p>Disney rebranded Hotstar in India to Disney+ Hotstar in 2020, merging in all content into one streaming platform.<br>

			<p><b><i>Court blow for US local net streamer <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/09/01/court-blow-for-us-local-net-streamer/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Network broadcasters have won a judgement that puts the future of TV station streamer, Locast, at risk.</p>
			<p>The US Court of Appeals for the Southern District of New York has ruled against its copyright defence of the service. Locast has relied on the premise that because it did not charge a user fee &#150; it solicits donations &#150; it did not have to ask permission from the stations or pay them to retransmit the signal online.</p>
			<p>Locast launched in January 2018, relying on Title 17, Chapter 1, section 111 (a) (5) of the Copyright Act, which covers exemptions from exclusive rights to broadcast transmissions. It grants exemption  for  &ldquo;non-profit organizations&rdquo; [&#x2026;] &ldquo;without charge to the recipients of the secondary transmission other than assessments necessary to defray the actual and reasonable costs of maintaining and operating the secondary transmission service&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>But the national networks argued that the service was a commercial operation and the court agreed. Locast said the court was treating copyright law as a moat around the broadcast networks.<br>

			<p><b><i>TVNZ plays a blinder and sets its own goals<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/300396804/tvnz-plays-a-blinder-and-sets-its-own-goals<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Government-owned network has its best financial result in years and announces major investment plans while the Government dithers over what role it wants publicly owned media to play.</p>
			<p>ANALYSIS: Whether he wanted to or not, TVNZ boss Kevin Kenrick just strengthened the arm of the hard heads in Treasury opposed to the idea of pumping tens of millions into restructuring the public media sector.</p>
			<p>TVNZ stakes its bet on digital services for viewers.</p>
			<p>TVNZ&rsquo;s decision to pay a $15 million dollar dividend to the Government blows away the prediction that sooner or later the state owned broadcaster will be on its knees crying for a hand out.</p>
			<p>Those arguing that TVNZ&rsquo;s receding commercial viability meant there was little to lose in compelling it to have wider social mandate and cater for niche audiences have run into a brick wall.</p>
			<p>Broadcasting Minister Kris Faafoi&rsquo;s advisory group is due to report soon on how TVNZ and RNZ could be turned into more resilient, innovative public broadcasters.</p>
			<p>Faafoi, with the help of two big accounting firms, has spent millions of dollars and more than two years trying to come up with a business plan that makes sense.</p>
			<p>Treasury, and now many of his Cabinet colleagues, are likely to be asking him a simple question: What&rsquo;s wrong with a payout of $15 million and carrying on as we are, thanks?</p>
			<p>It is true that Covid has played to TVNZ&rsquo;s advantage. Not being able to source the normal amount of content lowered the cost of programming by 30 per cent and overall operating expenses dropped by $67.3 million. Locked down audiences pushed up free-to-air ratings and helped the information heavy channel, TVNZ1, increase its market share.</p>
			<p>Other local media companies have improved their profitability through rigorous cost cutting but Kenrick and his team have done something that has eluded heavyweights like NZME and Sky. They have significantly increased revenue.</p>
			<p>Total advertising revenue rose to $322.2 million, $39 million more than the previous year. Net profit was $59.2 million, an improvement of $85 million on the year prior.</p>
			<p>No wonder Kenrick and the board handed out $2000 bonuses to eligible staff in what the CEO described as a &ldquo;quite remarkable&rdquo; year.</p>
			<p>TVNZ&rsquo;s result, and Sky&rsquo;s last week, shows that local streaming services are not being overwhelmed by US giants like Netflix, YouTube, Amazon and Disney+ in the way many predicted.</p>
			<p>In fact, some of the second tier US players have decided to partner with the local operators rather than launch their own services here.</p>
			<p>NBC Universal has done a deal to distribute its content through TVNZ instead of going it alone on its own with NBC Peacock and Warner Bros has opted for a multi-year agreement with SKY instead of putting HBO Max into the NZ market.</p>
			<p>Revenue from TVNZ on-demand increased 44 per cent in the financial year, repaying Kenrick for years of investment, investment that saw him, at times, cop considerable criticism.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Digital is now a strong double-digit part of our revenue and our aspiration is to grow it to 25 per cent of revenue within three years,&rdquo; Kenrick told Newsroom.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The growth in digital is now outpacing the decline in TV, both at an audience level and a revenue level.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The cost per thousand viewers [that TVNZ can charge advertisers] is higher on digital than we get for TV so this [growth in digital] is value accretive.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Kenrick says TVNZ&rsquo;s strategy is to take an increasing share of the declining TV market while going all out for growth in digital.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I think in digital we are still benefiting from system growth (people transitioning from linear broadcast TV to on-demand viewing). We are getting the late majority now, but it is still a fair chunk of viewers. At the same time I think we are strongly positioned in the market now, so our share of that growth is higher than many of the other players. We are in something of a sweet spot right now.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>While the politics of what will happen with state broadcasting are playing out Kenrick seems almost hell bent on remaining undistracted. He is pushing ahead with even more investment in digital, around $30 million over the next three years.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It will enable us to launch a raft of new and different products, we are looking this as [creating] a digital version of TVNZ itself. Ultimately, we see this as replacing broadcasting over time.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You need to have a view of what the future looks like and you need to make a start. You&rsquo;ve got to place a bet&#x2026;.we might not be right but we are not confused about what we are doing.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>What will that bet look like to viewers?</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I think what you will find is that the range of content available on-demand will be significantly increased. I think the ability to personalise, to get what you want, and find curated channels will be a big feature.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Think of it like Spotify where you have your own playlists. You might also follow the playlists of others.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>TVNZ&rsquo;s new platform will allow it to offer subscriber-based product for those who don&rsquo;t want to watch advertisements.</p>
			<p>Kenrick thinks Covid has put the network 12 to 18 months behind where it should be with its digital strategy but does not think the pandemic will slow things up again.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Last time there was a higher level of uncertainty but we have seen this movie before. What we have learned is that most businesses are hungry to get on with things. If you turn a business off, the loss of momentum is such that it takes a huge effort to turn it on again.&rdquo; <br>

			<p><b><i>World's first space junk cleaner satellite successfully picks up orbital debris<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Worlds_first_space_junk_cleaner_satellite_successfully_picks_up_orbital_debris_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>According to the Union of Concerned Scientists' database, there are more than 3,300 functioning satellites in orbit and thousands of pieces of junk that can be traced, including discarded boosters, derelict satellites, and pieces that have fallen off of vessels.</p>
			<p>In a major development that may ease concerns that dead satellites are being left to litter space, Japan's private firm Astroscale claimed that its demonstrator satellite ELSA-d has successfully captured a defunct satellite on Wednesday.</p>
			<p>&quot;A major challenge of debris removal, and on-orbit servicing in general, is docking with or capturing a client object; this test demonstration served as a successful validation of ELSA-d's ability to dock with a client, such as a defunct satellite,&quot; the firm, which launched the first commercial space junk clean-up mission in March this year, said on Thursday.</p>
			<p>The ELSA-d, which stands for End-of-Life Services by Astroscale-demonstration, is the world's first space junk cleaner satellite, designed to find and retrieve used satellites and other debris orbiting Earth. It was launched from Kazakhstan on a Soyuz 2.1a rocket by Russia's GK Launch Services along with 37 other payloads.</p>
			<p>&quot;It was a first step, but for us, it was big. The test was brief, with the client moving only centimetres away before the servicer fired its thrusters and reconnected with the client. The entire test lasted dozens of seconds. We were able to test out the cameras, the visualisation, the software and, most importantly, the capture mechanism,&quot; Chris Blackerby, chief operating officer of Astroscale, said in an interview during the 36th Space Symposium in Colorado, US.</p>
			<p>After the successful demonstration, ELSA-d will undergo several other tests that include attempting to capture an uncontrolled, tumbling space object. The final capture demonstration will be &quot;diagnosis and client search,&quot; in which the 175kg servicer satellite (meant to remove debris) will inspect the 17kg client satellite (defunct satellite serving as debris), withdraw to simulate a far-range search, then approach and recapture the client.</p>
			<p>The company is also working with the Japanese space agency JAXA on other missions. During the Symposium, Blackerby said that Astroscale will soon start working on a next-generation version of its ELSA spacecraft, called ELSA-m and it will be able to capture multiple pieces of debris.</p>
			<p>As space is becoming increasingly crowded, the rising level of debris in Earth's orbit has become a reason for concern. The amount of orbital debris has increased exponentially over the past 60 years and - according to a report published by NASA in January this year - millions of pieces of orbital debris now exist in low Earth orbit.</p>
			<p>&quot;At least 26,000 the size of a softball or larger that could destroy a satellite on impact; over 500,000 the size of a marble big enough to cause damage to spacecraft or satellites; and over 100 million the size of a grain of salt that could puncture a spacesuit,&quot; the report said.<br>

				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/08/31/indian-dth-market-shrinks/<br>
			</p>
			<p>While the market is proving increasingly lucrative for foreign streaming players, India&rsquo;s DTH industry has shrunk.</p>
			<p>According to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), the sector decreased by 1.42 million subscribers during the first quarter of 2021. </p>
			<p>Pay DTH has attained a total active subscriber base of around 69.57 million in the quarter ending 31st March 2021.</p>
			<p>This was however down from a 2020 peak of 70.99 million subscribers at the end of the year, and the lowest subscriber total since Q3 2019 when the sector was at 69.3 million.</p>
			<p>In terms of the current makeup of the DTH sector, there are four service providers. Tata Sky is the largest, with a 33.3% market share, followed by Bharti Telemedia with 25.54%, Dish TV India with 24.09% and Sun Direct TV at 17.07%.</p>
			<p>The report also noted that the country had achieved 100% digitisation of Cable TV networks, making India the only large country where the feat has been achieved through mandatory regulations. Siti Networks is the largest cable operator with 8.25 million subscribers.<br>

			<p><b><i>Australian CUAVA-1 satellite launched aboard Space-X rocket in Florida<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From http://honisoit.com/2021/08/australian-cuava-1-satellite-launched-aboard-space-x-rocket-in-florida/<br>
			</p>
			<p>An Australian satellite was launched aboard a Space-X Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida on Saturday.</p>
			<p>The satellite, dubbed CUAVA-1, is bound for deployment from the International Space Station, carrying four experimental payloads in the hopes of giving scientists and researchers fresh insights from near-Earth orbit.</p>
			<p>CUAVA-1 is a cubesat: a low-cost and simple way to access near-Earth orbit for scientific and commercial purposes. Cubesats are built from small boxes (only 10cm cubed, weighing no more than 1.3 kilograms each!) that are chock-full of cutting edge technology. In the case of CUAVA-1, picture three of these small cubes joined together, making a rectangular box around 30 cm long and weighing around 3 kilograms in mass.</p>
			<p>The launch of the satellite, which for the next 12 months will live 400 kilometres above Earth, checks a milestone in the lead project of the Australian Research Council Training Centre for CubeSats, Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles and their Applications (CUAVA). </p>
			<p>According to a press release received by Honi, the CUAVA-1 mission aims to: observe the Earth with novel imaging technology; investigate the Earth&rsquo;s plasma environment and space weather with the satellite&rsquo;s radiation detectors; and test equipment that will go on to be used in future satellites that will search for signs of life on planets around Alpha Centauri, our nearest star system. The bright dreams attached to this tiny cubesat are fixed on future horizons of space exploration.</p>
			<p>Based at the University of Sydney, CUAVA involves researchers and scientists from universities around the world, including the University of NSW, Macquarie University, multiple Australian commercial and government partners and the Rochester Institute of Technology in the United States.<br>
				CUAVA-1 engineers hard at work in the lab. Source: Reign MacMillan.</p>
			<p>The CUAVA project is partially funded by the NSW Government under the Australian Research Council&rsquo;s Industrial Transformation Training Centres scheme. CUAVA&rsquo;s government connections extend to its partnerships with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the Department of Defence. The responsibilities and parameters of CUAVA&rsquo;s partnership with the Department of Defence is as yet unclear. </p>
			<p>CUAVA is also commercially partnered with Air@Wave Communications, ArborCarbon, HyVista and Saber Astronautics.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This mission shows that Australian universities are at the forefront of our emerging national space industry,&rdquo; said Professor Iver Cairns, of USyd&rsquo;s own School of Physics, and Director of Cuava. &ldquo;Our CUAVA Training Centre is leading in the development of near-Earth space technology and is a critical link in training the next generation of space engineers and scientists.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>In the largely uncharted cosmos, the CUAVA-1 launch sees the Australian space industry take a step towards building international space cooperation.<br>

			</p>
			<p>There&rsquo;s nothing quite like sinking your teeth into a gripping documentary, and now Foxtel is allowing you to do it 24/7.</p>
			<p>Foxtel is set to debut its brand new channel airing around-the-clock documentaries.</p>
			<p>Fox Docos will be the home of newly-released documentaries as well as existing content from the Australian pay TV company&rsquo;s vast library, which includes more than 600 hours of HBO content.</p>
			<p>The channel, which launches on September 1, was created by Foxtel* amid an increasing demand among Aussies for gripping true story viewing.</p>
			<p>It will kick off with a bang with the premiere of Spike Lee&rsquo;s bold documentary, NYC Epicenters 9/11-2021&frac12;, a four-part docuseries about the infamous New York terror attack, which will have its global premiere on Wednesday at 7.30pm, AEST.</p>
			<p>An inspirational locally-made Foxtel original documentary featuring Australian of the Year Grace Tame, titled Walking with Hope, is also set premiere the following day, on September 2.</p>
			<p>Foxtel General Manager, Factual, Jim Buchan said: &ldquo;We know there&rsquo;s a huge appetite for premium, nonfiction storytelling in Australia, and the popularity of true and unforgettable stories with audiences continues to grow.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In our mission to bring world-class entertainment to the living rooms and screens of more Australians each and every day, FOX DOCOS will give our customers an unrivalled destination for brand new, highly acclaimed world class documentaries all in one place.&rdquo;</p>

			<p><b><i>EXCLUSIVE: Foxtel To Launch New iQ5 Box &amp; Major iQ4 Software Update<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.channelnews.com.au/exclusive-foxtel-to-launch-new-iq5-box-network-major-iq4-software-up/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Foxtel chief executive Patrick Delany will next week roll out a brand-new Foxtel dual band Wi Fi 6, iQ5 Smart Media Device in what will be a staggered launch for the streaming network due to component supply problems.</p>
			<p>The new iQ5 is a cutting-edge cloud based streaming box that ChannelNews exclusively revealed earlier this year.</p>
			<p>Users currently on the Foxtel cable network will be able to upgrade to the new Wi Fi 6 enabled voice activated streaming box that is capable of high-speed IP delivery of content.</p>
			<p>Wi Fi 6 is the latest Wi Fi streaming technology with routers currently on sale at JB Hi Fi, the technology allows more devices that ever before to be attached to a network with minimum disruption to the network and the streaming of content.</p>
			<p>Manufactured by CommScope, the owners of Arris, one of the most popular networking Companies in the USA alongside Netgear and D-Link, the new box allows Foxtel customers to run not only their content streaming but manage home automation devices from one box.</p>
			<p>Foxtel is also set to release new software that turns an iQ4 box into an Internet only Wi Fi broadband box eliminating the need for a cable service.</p>
			<p>According to Foxtel sources the roll out of the new box will not be rushed as there is limited supply due to the global shortage of components, this is a problem that is plaguing TV manufacturers and brands such as Samsung, LG and the likes of Apple who is set to release their new iPhone 3 on the 15th of September.</p>
			<p>The new Foxtel iQ5 Smart Media Device is a compact UHD IP device with far-field microphones, speakers and DSP (Digital Signal Processing) that enables the integration of voice assistants into the TV experience.</p>
			<p>At this stage and due to supply problems, the box will not be sold in retail stores.</p>
			<p>The iQ5 allows voice-controlled services in the home to be displayed on a TV enabling the voice control of multiple video services.</p>
			<p>Inside the box is a high performance Vulkan graphics card and video decoding that is capable of delivering 4K UltraHD/High Dynamic content and OTT video services.</p>
			<p>Dual-band Wi-Fi 6 provides reliable video streaming over wireless even when there are multiple devices running in a home.</p>
			<p>Technical specifications.<br>
				Video<br>
				&bull; 4Kp60 10-bit UltraHD video decode and resolution<br>
				&bull; HDR10, HDR10+ (option), HLG, and Dolby Vision (option) formats supported<br>
				&bull; AV1, HEVC, MPEG-4 AVC, VP9, and VC-1 video codecs<br>
				&bull; Wi-Fi 6, 802.11ax, 2&times;2, Dual Band Selectable<br>
				.&bull; DRM pre-integration with Microsoft&reg; PlayReady&reg;, Widevine&reg;, and CommScope SECUREMEDIA&reg; DRM<br>
				&bull; Compliant with OTT services: Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and others<br>
				&bull; Bluetooth&reg; 5 Low Energy and IR (optional) remote control interfaces</p>
			<p>Smart Assistant support<br>
				&bull; 2 microphones, 2 x 7W speakers, passive resonator, smart amplifier and DSP for voice-visual assistants.<br>
				&bull; Compatible with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and other 3rd Party assistants.</p>
			<p>Delany recently admitted what SmartHouse exclusively revealed back in 2015 that the &ldquo;The IQ3 [set-top box] was problematic, if not a failure, and it was the same with [former streaming service] Presto, and that was because everyone was focused on fixing and driving Foxtel.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>These days Delany is focused shifting Foxtel cable customers to a new generation service that allows the network to cut costs while providing customers with a new level of capability in the home.</p>
			<p>He admits that there is a Foxtel of old and that his job now, is to transform the business to be a cutting-edge streaming Company, that leads with sports and movie content that is delivered over an IP network instead of old legacy networks that the business was forced to use in the early days of Foxtel.</p>
			<p>it does not want to be depicted as a traditional pay TV business anymore.</p>
			<p>Right round the world consumers are moving to content streamed over an IP or broadband network.</p>
			<p>For example, Foxtel customers with an iQ5 account will be able to watch the same Foxtel content on a tablet, mobile, PC or a Foxtel Now box that they can take away to a weekender or holiday home.</p>
			<p>The Companies Kayo Sports and Binge, have both proven popular with consumers amassing 1.05 million and 733,000 subscribers respectively, these services are delivered over an IP or Wi Fi network similar to what upgraded iQ4 and iQ5 box customers will be able to experience in 4K or Ultra High Definition.</p>
			<p>Currently the business has 200,000 plus cable TV subscribers who will be able to move to the new set-top box.</p>
			<p>For Foxtel the move means the elimination of physical infrastructure and customers will not have to wait for a contractor to install the iQ5. It will be shipped directed with consumers able to activate the device similar to a mobile phone or logging into a Samsung or LG account on a TV.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It allows us to really dramatically reduce cost,&rdquo; Delany explains. &ldquo;Rather than giving everyone a disk drive, you can put everything in the cloud. Instead of having to call centres, you can do everything digitally.&rdquo; Delany said.<br>

				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Astra_rocket_fails_after_liftoff_from_Alaska_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>California-based Astra Space, a small, relatively new rocket company, failed in flight Saturday after a launch from Alaska supported in part by the U.S. Space Force.</p>
			<p>The rocket &quot;suffered an anomaly&quot; about 2 1/2 minutes after liftoff from Kodiak shortly after 6:30 p.m. EDT, the company said, not elaborating on what happened.</p>
			<p>The failure followed an aborted attempt the day before, which the company did not explain. That launch was called off just seconds before the planned liftoff.</p>
			<p>Astra Space had not released details about the payload Saturday, except to say that it contain sensors to monitor conditions during launch for future Space Force missions.</p>
			<p>Company officials said they expected to learn a great deal from the telemetry data before the 38-foot rocket experienced &quot;technical difficulties.&quot;</p>
			<p>A top executive at Astra Space, which is publicly traded, acknowledged during an Aug. 12 teleconference the risks involved in producing an experimental rocket.</p>
			<p>&quot;Maximizing our learning requires us to make advances and take appropriate technical risks,&quot; Astra founder and CEO Chris Kemp said during the call. Kemp is a former NASA chief technology officer.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.cnet.com/news/iphone-13-cost-now-it-sounds-like-apple-might-raise-the-price-after-all/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Hardware will allow it to make calls and send texts in areas lacking cellular coverage, according to an analyst's note.</p>
			<p>The iPhone 13 will reportedly have hardware that will allow it to tap satellite communications.</p>
			<p>Apple's iPhone 13 will feature satellite communication connectivity that will allow users to make calls and send texts in areas without cellular coverage, according to a note from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.</p>
			<p>The forthcoming handset will include hardware that allows it to tap low Earth orbit satellites, allowing it to stay connected in areas that lack 4G or 5G coverage, Kuo told investors in a note seen by MacRumors. The iPhone 13 is expected to use Qualcomm X60 baseband chip, which reportedly supports satellite communications.</p>
			<p>Such a feature would make the iPhone more attractive to consumers who live in or near areas not well served by cellular service, as well as well as travelers who venture into areas that don't have coverage but still want the peace of mind of always available communications typically reserved for satellite phones.</p>
			<p>Elon Musk's SpaceX has captured much attention with the launch of Starlink satellites expected to deliver its nascent broadband service to reach just about anywhere in the world. But SpaceX isn't the only company hoping to operate a constellation of satellites in low Earth orbit.</p>
			<p>Kuo singles out LEO satellite communication service provider Globalstar as the company &quot;most likely to cooperate with Apple in terms of technology and service coverage.&quot; Globalstar has operated dozens of satellites for voice services at that altitude for many years.</p>
			<p>The new iPhone is expected to debut in September, with rumored features such as an upgraded design with a smaller notch, thicker camera bump and a collection of nifty new color options like bubblegum pink, matte black and a bronzy sunset gold.</p>
			<p>Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.<br>

			<p><b><i>Launch company Rocket Lab goes public<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.space.com/rocket-lab-goes-public-spac-merger<br>
			</p>
			<p>Founder and CEO Peter Beck rang the Nasdaq opening bell Wednesday morning (Aug. 25).</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab is the latest space company to go public.</p>
			<p>California-based Rocket Lab, which has launched more than 100 small satellites to orbit with its Electron booster to date, has completed its previously announced merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Rocket Lab began trading on the Nasdaq market Wednesday (Aug. 25), under the ticker symbol &quot;RKLB.&quot;</p>
			<p>Nasdaq celebrated the milestone, inviting Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck to ring the market's opening bell Wednesday morning.</p>
			<p>The SPAC merger, with a San Francisco-based company called Vector Acquisition Corporation, provides Rocket Lab with about $777 million. The funds will aid the development of multiple projects, including Rocket Lab's big, next-generation Neutron rocket, company representatives said.</p>
			<p>&quot;Our team is motivated by the enormous impact we can have on Earth by making it easier to get to space and to do incredible things there. We are excited to be making that a reality by embarking on our next chapter as a public company,&quot; Beck said in a statement Wednesday. </p>
			<p>&quot;With our Electron rocket and Photon spacecraft, we've simplified space, making it easy and affordable for companies, scientists, governments and entrepreneurs alike to get their ideas to orbit,&quot; he added. &quot;Today, we take the next step toward unlocking the full potential of space, paving the way for our larger Neutron launch vehicle which will deploy the constellations of the future, and supporting our potential future expansion into space applications. I am thrilled to declare space open for business.&quot;</p>
			<p>Going public is something of a trend in the space business these days. For example, Rocket Lab competitor Astra went public on June 30, becoming the first launch company ever to do so. (Astra co-founder and CEO Chris Kemp got to ring the Nasdaq bell, too.) And another small-satellite launch company, Virgin Orbit, announced a SPAC deal of its own just this week. <br>

			<p><b><i>Panasonic claims IFC speed milestone <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/08/27/panasonic-claims-ifc-speed-milestone/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Panasonic Avionics, China Eastern Airlines, APT Mobile SatCom and China Telecom Satellite Communications are claiming a performance milestone for in-flight connectivity service over China, using Panasonic Avionics&rsquo; new Extreme Throughput Satellite (XTS) service on the APStar 6D communications satellite.</p>
			<p>On a recent China Eastern Airlines&rsquo; flight MU5105, passengers saw average speeds up to 100 megabits per second (Mbps) to the aircraft, with peak speeds reaching 200 Mbps. As a result, passengers were able to enjoy services such as streaming video, video conferencing, downloading large files, and high-speed web browsing, on multiple devices, all at the same time.</p>
			<p>These new performance benchmarks were made possible by the APStar 6D satellite technology jointly designed by Panasonic Avionics and APSATCOM. The aircraft used had previously been equipped with in-flight connectivity hardware from Panasonic Avionics and no changes or upgrades to the existing antenna, wireless access points, satellite modem, or other critical component were required.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is indeed an exciting achievement for Panasonic Avionics,&rdquo; declared Ron Ho, Vice President and General Manager, Asia Pacific of Panasonic Avionics. &ldquo;The data that we saw from flight MU5105 underscores our commitment to being the leader in connectivity to airlines in China, across the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, and around the world.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;As the largest provider of satellite-based in-flight connectivity to airlines around the world, Panasonic knows that the demand for reliable, high-speed in-flight connectivity remains a top customer priority, especially in strategic markets across Asia Pacific like China, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and others. With our significant investment in APStar 6D, Panasonic Avionics is uniquely positioned to exceed customer expectations for in-flight connectivity, not only today, but for the future.  All aircraft equipped by Panasonic for connectivity will automatically utilise APStar 6D as they transit through the region.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;APStar 6D is the world&rsquo;s first extreme-throughput communication satellite based for mobile service optimisation,&rdquo; added Jason Li, CEO of APSATCOM. &ldquo;Beams of different sizes, capacity and bandwidth, dynamic adjustment capability and full view coverage are unique designs for the characteristics of satellite in-flight mobile service. We believe that APStar 6D is the most ideal solution for Panasonic Avionics to realise in-flight connectivity service in China and even the whole APAC region. In the future, APSTCOM will maintain close cooperation with Panasonic Avionics to optimise operating costs for airlines, and enable more passengers to enjoy high-quality, diversified network services.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Panasonic Avionics&rsquo; global satellite network covers over 99 per cent of all flight routes, and places capacity where it is most needed to meet the growing needs of airlines and their passengers. It supports the provision of services such as high-speed Internet, video streaming, VoIP applications, HD video, live television, phone services, and even dedicated bandwidth for crew applications.</p>
			<p>Panasonic Avionics has delivered over 2,300 in-flight connectivity solutions worldwide.<br>

			<p><b><i>Amazon Urges FCC to Deny SpaceX's Plan for Second-Generation Starlink<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://au.pcmag.com/networking/89047/amazon-urges-fcc-to-deny-spacexs-plan-for-second-generation-starlink<br>
			</p>
			<p>Amazon's own satellite broadband company, Kuiper Systems, claims SpaceX's proposals for the second-generation Starlink are too broad and speculative, and break FCC rules.</p>
			<p>Amazon is asking the FCC to deny a SpaceX plan to develop a second-generation Starlink network, claiming it breaks the regulator&rsquo;s rules on satellite deployment.  </p>
			<p>Amazon's protest letter comes as the company is developing its own satellite internet system called Project Kuiper, which has yet to take off. </p>
			<p>Starlink, on the other hand, is already serving 100,000 users across the globe through 1,700 satellites in orbit. The network is currently delivering download speeds from 50Mbps to 150Mbps or higher. But to improve coverage and upgrade speeds, SpaceX is seeking FCC clearance to operate a second-generation Starlink network comprising nearly 30,000 satellites. </p>
			<p>Amazon claims the plan is too broad and speculative, and thus breaks the FCC&rsquo;s rules on applying for satellite deployments. The e-commerce giant notes that SpaceX&rsquo;s application for the second-generation network seeks permission for not just one, but two configurations to align the 30,000 Starlink satellites. <br>
				The two configurations.</p>
			<p>SpaceX only intends on using one configuration during the actual deployment. The company's FCC application also notes the second proposed configuration is meant to serve as a backup. Nevertheless, Amazon isn't onboard with the justifications.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;SpaceX's novel approach of applying for two mutually exclusive configurations is at odds with both the Commission&rsquo;s rules and public policy and we urge the Commission to dismiss this amendment,&rdquo; Amazon says in the letter. &ldquo;The Commission&rsquo;s rules require that SpaceX settle the details of its proposed amendment before filing its application&#151;not after.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>As a result, Amazon is calling on the FCC to dismiss the plan in its current form. According to Amazon, relaxing the rules risks encouraging SpaceX and other companies to seek clearance for &ldquo;speculative&rdquo; applications that try to lock in access for various satellite configurations. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;Other prospective licensees will surely see the benefit in maximizing their optionality by describing multiple configurations in their license applications,&rdquo; Amazon adds. &ldquo;The Commission must guard against this outcome by insisting that SpaceX adhere to the well settled framework under Part 25&#151;namely, that licensees submit an application for a single system.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, the company provided two configurations because the first one relies on the still under-development Starship craft to deliver the Starlink satellites. The second configuration taps existing Falcon 9 reusable rockets. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;Under either configuration, the revised Gen2 System will further optimize service to customers and better meet demand for low-latency, high-bandwidth  broadband  services, especially in underserved and unserved areas, all while using slightly fewer satellites,&rdquo; SpaceX says.</p>
			<p>The letter comes shortly after former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos slammed NASA for giving SpaceX a lunar landing contract over his own spaceflight company, Blue Origin.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Musk_announces_key_milestone_as_Starlink_reaches_100000_users_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Starlink project, aimed to blanket the surface of the planet with low-latency satellite internet, is operated by Elon Musk's company SpaceX that, in 2019, began launching small satellites into low-Earth orbit. To date, the Starlink constellation consists of over 1,600 satellites, while the goal is to use nearly 30,000.</p>
			<p>Tech billionaire and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Monday tweeted that the Starlink project has already distributed 100,000 terminals to users from the US, Canada, Europe, New Zealand and Australia.</p>
			<p>&quot;Our license applications are pending in many more countries. Hoping to serve Earth soon!&quot; Musk tweeted.</p>
			<p>A monthly subscription to Starlink satellite Internet currently costs roughly $100 worldwide, excluding taxes, while the terminal is nearly $500 although that price is expected to drop through the company's use of economies of scale. The latter contains a set of hardware that includes a Wi-Fi router, power supply, cables and a mounting tripod with a dish to provide immediate access to Internet.</p>
			<p>Speaking earlier at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, Musk noted that the company will likely reduce the price of the device to $200-350 as some customers may live in remote areas, with limited or no access to electricity.</p>
			<p>He also revealed that Starlink's global connectivity provider would cover almost all of the planet by August 2021, and the company plans to reach 500,000 users in one year. As of May, according to Musk, the company has received approximately 500,000 applications from interested clients throughout the world.</p>
			<p>Starlink's satellite Internet went live in October 2020, and Ookla's Speedtest.com service showed early this month that Starlink had almost reached the speed of hard-wired broadband internet providers in the US, while exceeding competitors in Canada, the UK, New Zealand and other countries.</p>
			<p>Replying to Musk's recent tweets, many users, especially those claiming to be in rural areas, showed an eagerness to obtain the service, often complaining about slow and overly expensive Internet connectivity.<br>

				From https://www.terradaily.com/reports/China_to_build_satellite_constellation_for_natural_disaster_observation_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>China has initiated a project of building a constellation of 36 low-orbit satellites to gather information for forecasting natural disasters and monitoring urban emergencies.</p>
			<p>The project undertaken by the Tianjin Satcom Geohe Technologies Co., Ltd. was inaugurated on Tuesday in China's spacecraft launch center of Wenchang, in South China's Hainan province.</p>
			<p>Guo Jianqiang, president of the tech firm based in North China's Tianjin municipality, said the first satellite will be launched and commissioned in space in June 2022. All 36 satellites will have been launched by the end of May in 2023 to complete the constellation.</p>
			<p>The satellite network will provide high-resolution images to help observers identify millimeter-level geological deformations in order to gauge the possibilities of geological disasters, such as landslide, subsidence and collapse, said Guo, also an official with China Geological Survey.</p>
			<p>Guo said satellite data combined with geological survey and monitoring data captured by ground sensors in geohazard-prone areas can significantly improve the accuracy and timeliness of natural disaster prediction.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Intelsat has told its Chapter 11 bankruptcy court that it has achieved the support of some of its major debt holders. Intelsat says that it could lead to a &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; financial restructuring that would reduce the operator&rsquo;s debt by more than half &#150; from almost $15 billion (&euro;12.7bn) to $7 billion.</p>
			<p>The proposal, which comes with Intelsat&rsquo;s Amended Plan of Reorganisation, has to be approved by its bankruptcy court. If accepted, it could mean Intelsat exiting bankruptcy by the end of this year.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The Amended Plan has the support of holders of approximately $11 billion, or nearly 75 per cent, of the Company&rsquo;s funded debt. These supporting creditors have executed a Plan Support Agreement that binds their support for the Company&rsquo;s Amended Plan,&rdquo; states Intelsat.</p>
			<p>The Amended Plan provides that Intelsat will emerge as a private company, with the support of new equity owners, to best advance its strategic objectives and accelerate its growth trajectory, with a path to becoming publicly traded again at some point in the next five years.</p>
			<p>Intelsat&rsquo;s 607-page Plan document was filed with the bankruptcy court on August 24th. There is a scheduled hearing before Judge Keith Phillips on September 1st.<br>

			</p>
			<p>The Express-AM5 satellite, operated by RSCC, is now restoring communications and the internet in the Yakutia regions of Russia that have been affected by the fire Information notice &#151; the satellite assignment makes it possible to prevent serious communication interruptions.</p>
			<p>Forest fires have swept over 7 million hectares in Yakutia, burning out an area comparable to that of a small, European country. Residential buildings and social infrastructure have been damaged and in some areas there is no electricity and communication facilities are not available.<br>

			<p>To restore the internet in rural areas and put in place facilities for prompt notifications for local inhabitants, specialists of the regional telecom operator ArcticTelecom use VSAT SATCOM stations and the capabilities of the Express-AM5 satellite at the 140&deg; E orbital position. Television, radio and satellite Internet are now available in almost all affected settlements, thanks to the efficient work of the ArcticTelecom engineers.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;A satellite is the most reliable means of communication both in the process of eliminating the consequences of disasters and in preventing them. Every year in Russia, up to one hundred emergencies occur, involving shutdowns of ground networks. The reliability of the satellite network on such occasions is almost 100%. But for the system to work smoothly in emergency situations, it must be within reach of local inhabitants and, naturally, of emergency services. In the event of disaster, there is no time to set up equipment and train personnel. In Yakutia, satellite communication networks were built in 2005 and integrated into the region&rsquo;s general communication infrastructure. In the current situation of forest fires, this plays a key role in the prompt restoration of communications in the republic&rdquo;, emphasized Alexey Volin, RSCC General Director.<br>

			<p><b><i>Optus announces bid for Defence satellite program<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.innovationaus.com/optus-announces-bid-for-defence-satellite-program/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Telco giant Optus will lead a bid alongside two multinational Defence contractors for a major satellite communications system project aimed at providing Australia&rsquo;s military with sovereign capability in space.</p>
			<p>Optus and Defence contractors Raytheon Australia and Thales Australia join other bidders that include Lockheed Martin Australia, Airbus and Boeing Defence Australia.<br>
				Flight VA218, which took the Optus-10 satellites into space in 2014.</p>
			<p>Potentially worth billions of dollars, with some industry estimates putting the cost of the project between $2 to $3 billion, Defence issued a tender for the JP9102 Australia Defence Satellite Communication System on April 22. It forms part of the federal government&rsquo;s $7 billion investment in Defence space capabilities over the next 10 years.</p>
			<p>According to the Defence Integrated Investment Plan (IIP) released in 2016, it was anticipated that between 2016&#150;2029 up to $3 billion would be spent on satellite and terrestrial communications.</p>
			<p>Optus&rsquo; intention to bid comes as Defence extended on Friday the request for tender process by more than two months, citing COVID-19 lockdowns across Australia and overseas. Originally, bidders had until October 25 to respond but will now have until January 10 next year. The awarding of the contract isn&rsquo;t expected until the third quarter of 2022.</p>
			<p>The scope of the project is to deliver, and support through life, the space, ground and control segments of sovereign satellite communications, according to the tender, &ldquo;which will provide coverage of the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean regions including areas of strategic interest in the vicinity of Australia&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The [Sovereign Satellite Communications] will increase the capacity, resilience, agility, and flexibility of Defence&rsquo;s military SATCOM capability.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>When announcing the project in March last year, former Defence minister Linda Reynolds said it would be &ldquo;Australia&rsquo;s first fully owned and controlled military satellite communication constellation&rdquo;. However, tender documents have since indicated that the government is considering alternatives where it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily own the satellites.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In September 2020, Defence advised&#x2026;that &lsquo;Defence ownership of the Mission System is required for a compliant proposal [to the proposed RFT]&rsquo;. This advice has now changed,&rdquo; tender documents published in February state. &ldquo;Government has asked Defence to consider, as an option, non-Defence owned Satellites.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;For clarity, Defence&rsquo;s core capability requirements will remain common to both satellite ownership models including the requirement for Defence control of the entire system. All tenderers must submit a Defence owned and operated solution but may also offer, as an option, non-Defence owned satellites.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Raytheon Australia Managing Director Michael Ward said the company was ready to draw on its decades of expertise in delivering certified and integrated space systems as part of its bid.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Raytheon Australia has been delivering certified sovereign space solutions and complex system integration to the Australian Defence Force for decades, partnering with them and local industry to unlock the full potential of satellite data,&rdquo; Mr Ward said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We welcome the opportunity to collaborate with Optus and Thales Australia to provide a next-generation satellite technology solution, and we look forward to offering our global space surveillance and operation capabilities to the Australian Government through this important partnership.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Optus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin said the Optus bid would provide a unique opportunity to grow Australian skills in a high-tech sector.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Through Team AUSSAT&rsquo;s bid, we will bring the best solution, capabilities and experience for the benefit of Australia, and the safety and security of all Australians.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The bid team&#x2026;has a unique proposition being the only team with an unrivalled history of owning and operating satellites in Australia, by Australians, for Australians &#150; drawing synergies from two partner companies with their exceptional pedigrees in building and delivering world-class Defence capabilities.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Thales Australia CEO Chris Jenkins said the team of Optus, Raytheon Australia and Thales Australia would deliver a &ldquo;genuine sovereign Australian capability&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Thales Australia has been a trusted partner of the ADF for more than three decades, delivering advanced secure communication solutions, and we&rsquo;re proud to partner with Optus and Raytheon Australia on this project.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Since 1985, Optus has launched 10 satellites, operated 13 spacecraft, and provided support to over 100 international space programs. The telco has also flown the C1 Satellite since 2003, which provides critical mission capabilities for Defence&rsquo;s operations and, at the time of launch, was the world&rsquo;s largest Defence-civilian spacecraft.</p>
			<p>But the C1 Satellite is near its end of life, with Defence spending $40 million in 2017 to extend its life to 2027 by reconfiguring it to operate in an inclined orbit to reduce onboard fuel usage.</p>
			<p>Optus Satellite&rsquo;s main gateway is in Belrose (NSW) with other operations in Lockridge (WA); Hume (ACT); and Regency Park (SA).<br>

				From https://www.zdnet.com/article/curtin-university-gears-up-to-launch-western-australias-first-satellite-into-orbit/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Binar-1 CubeSat will be one of seven Binar CubSat-planned launches this year and next.</p>
			<p>Western Australia is preparing to launch its first locally designed and built space satellite.</p>
			<p>Developed by students and engineers at Curtin University's Space Science and Technology Centre, the Binar-1 CubeSat has been designed to locate and produce high resolution digital mapping of resources on the Moon's surface.</p>
			<p>The Binar-1 is scheduled to take-off from Cape Canaveral, United States on August 28, as part of the SpaceX CRS-23 commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station. Following its launch, the spacecraft will then be deployed into low-earth orbit from the International Space Station.</p>
			<p>According to Curtin University, the objective of Binar-1 is to test all the critical spacecraft systems, while the two cameras on board will aim to capture images of the Western Australia coastline and relay them back to Earth.  </p>
			<p>&quot;Our novel design allows us to make spacecraft affordable, and space accessible for WA innovators,&quot; Curtin University Vice-Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne said.</p>
			<p>&quot;We will be able to control and command our missions from Perth through Fugro's Australian Space Automation, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Control Complex (SpAARC), which will use Binar CubeSats to test remote operation protocols on a spacecraft in orbit.</p>
			<p>&quot;Our ultimate goal is to have a WA-built spacecraft at the Moon by 2025. Space missions like that don't just inspire, they also drive innovation. The launch of Binar-1 is our first real step towards that goal. Being able to build spacecraft affordably means that we can rapidly iterate technology, which is a key element in developing advanced systems for exploration, that then also benefit other industry sectors.&quot;  </p>
			<p>The Binar-1 CubSat will be the first of seven Binar CubSat launches planned for this year and next.</p>
			<p>&quot;Western Australia is about to make history with the State's first space mission,&quot; WA Premier Mark McGowan said.</p>
			<p> &quot;I am immensely proud of the students and engineers who have developed this amazing technology which opens so many doors for future missions and collaboration with the public and private sectors.&quot;</p>
			<p>Similar satellite projects are underway in other states across Australia, including New South Wales, which is set to launch a &quot;ride-share&quot; satellite into orbit to test and prove its functionality. The satellite is being delivered under Project Waratah Seed.</p>
			<p>South Australian government, meanwhile, announced earlier this year a AU$6.5 million SASAT1 space mission that will see the state launch its own small satellite into low orbit in 2022.</p>
			<p>Also on Monday, Optus announced it is teaming up with Raytheon Australia and Thales Australia to jointly bid for the JP9102 Australia Defence Communication System program, focused on delivering satellite technology to the Australian Defence Force.</p>
			<p>&quot;As sector pioneers and the leading investor in the Australian space industry, our solution will leverage our long track record of delivering for Australia's Defence agencies, supporting Australian industry capabilities, and our unwavering commitment to deliver a sovereign solution that enhances Australia's security,&quot; Optus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin said.</p>
			<p>&quot;The bid team, Team AUSSAT, has a unique proposition being the only team with an unrivalled history of owning and operating satellites in Australia, by Australians, for Australians &#150; drawing synergies from two partner companies with their exceptional pedigrees in building and delivering world-class Defence capabilities.&quot;</p>
			<p>Optus currently flies seven satellites, including NBN's two Sky Muster satellites.</p>
			<p>The telco giant recently announced plans to deploy software-defined satellite Optus 11 in 2023. Optus touted the Ku-band satellite as software-defined, which would allow it to be &quot;fully configurable&quot; once launched.<br>

			<p><b><i>Rocket Lab to launch satellite aimed at reducing space junk<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/300385956/rocket-lab-to-launch-satellite-aimed-at-reducing-space-junk<br>
			</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab will carry a satellite to low Earth orbit designed to reduce the amount of dangerous space junk.</p>
			<p>Launching from the company&rsquo;s Mahia Peninsular complex sometime near the end of the year, the Finnish-designed AuroraSat-1 will test its new technology after being released above the planet&rsquo;s surface.</p>
			<p>The new tech includes a water-based propellant system and deployable Plasma Brakes, which effectively create drag in low Earth orbit, slowing craft and making them more susceptible to the planet&rsquo;s gravitational pull.</p>
			<p>The US Department of Defense&rsquo;s global Space Surveillance Network (SSN) sensors track more than 27,000 pieces of orbital debris, or space junk.</p>
			<p>The AuroraSat-1 will test various bits of kit designed to help solve the issue of space junk.</p>
			<p>However, much of it is too small to be tracked. Because both the debris and spacecraft are travelling at speeds of approximately 15,700 mph, even a tiny paint fleck can damage spacecraft or satellites.</p>
			<p>The AuroraSat-1 was developed by Aurora Propulsion Technologies, a Finnish company dedicated to the sustainable use of space.</p>
			<p>The CubeSat, which is roughly the size of a toaster, will test the company&rsquo;s water-based propellant and its system that can help control a satellite&rsquo;s altitude,or right it, if it starts to tumble.</p>
			<p>The AuroraSat-1 will be launched to low Earth orbit during the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
			<p>AuroraSat-1 will also test its deployable Plasma Brakes.</p>
			<p>These combine a very small tether with charged particles in space, which generate drag, which could be used to slow spacecraft and pull them out of orbit when they reach the end of their usable life.</p>
			<p>Satellites brought down from orbit will typically burn up on re-entry to the atmosphere.</p>
			<p>AuroraSat-1&rsquo;s tech could one day be fitted to satellites to enable operators to bring them back to Earth, rather than allowing them to accumulate as more space junk.</p>
			<p>The AuroraSat-1 is only about the size of a toaster, but will trial some fancy new tech.</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab founder and chief executive Peter Beck said getting the satellite to space would allow Aurora to bring its tech to the market more quickly.</p>
			<p>The mission is expected to follow three back-to-back Electron launches in August and September, which will see the CAPSTONE mission to the Moon begun in support of NASA&rsquo;s Artemis program.</p>
			<p>The AuroraSat-1 will be launched as part of a ride-share mission from Mahia Peninsular.</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab spokeswoman Murielle Baker described space junk as a growing problem.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;With the significant increase in the predicted number of spacecraft needing to get on orbit in the next few years, the problem of space junk will only get worse if action isn&rsquo;t taken. </p>
			<p> &ldquo;With space junk congesting room on orbit for satellites, there is a risk of collision for all launchers because of it.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>In a separate effort to make space more sustainable, Rocket Lab are also working on a method of recovering the first stage of its Electron rocket, which would usually drop back to Earth and be lost.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2169519/legal-fears-leave-satellite-bids-up-in-the-air<br>
			</p>
			<p>Constitutional challenge likely to delay auction of orbital slots</p>
			<p>Efforts by the telecom regulator to liberalise the satellite business through a licensing regime and the auction of orbital slots now seem stuck in limbo, complicated by various issues including the risk of constitutional violation.</p>
			<p>The board of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) on Aug 18 decided to cancel the auction slated for Aug 28 because only one bidder was participating. That bidder was TC Space Connect, wholly owned by SET-listed satellite service provider Thaicom.</p>
			<p>Trairat Viriyasirikul, acting secretary-general of the NBTC, said only one bidder would mean an unfair auction, while NBTC management was instructed to adjust the principles and methods of the auction to create better conditions.</p>
			<p>The Aug 28 auction was meant to mark the transition of the country's satellite business from a concession model to a licensing regime.</p>
			<p>A politician recently questioned whether an auction breaches the constitution, claiming the NBTC has no right to conduct the auction of the satellite orbital slots.</p>
			<p>The NBTC is convinced it has the authority to hold the auction, according to Section 27 of the amended NBTC Act, which came into effect in 2019.</p>
			<p>The issue is likely to end up in the Constitutional Court, which means any auction would be delayed until a ruling. The delay could affect the national interest as the country risks losing the orbital slots if they are left unused for three years, in line with the principle of the Master International Frequency Register.</p>
			<p>A source on the NBTC board who requested anonymity said the board held two meetings before deciding to scrap the auction. The first meeting the board passed a resolution to cancel an auction condition that allows the bidding to take place even if there is only one contender. The board also scrapped the auction's timeline.</p>
			<p>The source said NBTC acting chairman Gen Sukit Khamasundara implied at the meeting the government had signalled the Aug 28 auction had to be aborted.</p>
			<p>LEGAL CHALLENGE</p>
			<p>Warong Dechgitvigrom, acting leader of the Thai Pakdee Party, pointed out the auction risks violating Section 60 of the constitution.</p>
			<p>The section indicates that transmission frequencies and satellite orbits are national treasures, and the state must maintain them in order to use them for the benefit of the country and the people.</p>
			<p>Mr Warong said an auction under a licensing regime would be detrimental to the country as all assets involved would fall into the hands of private companies.</p>
			<p>Orbital slots should be allocated only through concession, where all related assets will have to be transferred to the state, he said.</p>
			<p>The section does not make clear the NBTC's role in the orbital slot usage arrangement, said Mr Warong.</p>
			<p>He petitioned the Central Administrative Court on Aug 17 to issue an injunction to suspend the auction, and asked the court to forward the issue to the Constitutional Court to rule whether the auction breaches the charter. Mr Warong also filed a petition with the government and the NBTC to halt the auction.</p>
			<p>The NBTC source said the regulator's board and management strongly believe it has a duty to award the rights to the orbital slots.</p>
			<p>Citing Section 27 of the amended NBTC Act, the source said the agency has a responsibility to draft the principles and methods for awarding the rights to use satellite orbital slots.</p>
			<p>&quot;Given Section 27, the NBTC board and management cannot reject its duty and authority to manage the rights to use the orbital slots,&quot; the source said.</p>
			<p>The NBTC could face legal action if the orbital slot usage rights are taken away from the country because they are left unused, based on the Master International Frequency Register, the source said.</p>
			<p>&quot;No one can predict a timeline for the auction. We need a clear direction from the government,&quot; the source said. &quot;It is good the Constitutional Court will look at this issue because the court's judgement will settle it.&quot;</p>
			<p>A satellite business veteran who requested anonymity said it is important to consider whether the orbital slots are really national treasures.</p>
			<p>&quot;Utilisation of the slots need to be recorded in the Master International Frequency Register and approved by the International Telecommunication Union,&quot; he said.</p>
			<p>Digital Economy and Society Minister Chaiwut Thanakamanusorn has made it clear the auction should be presided over by new NBTC board members. The recruitment of new board members has begun.</p>
			<p>The auction, which involves many slots, requires thorough and prudent consideration to ensure optimum benefit for the country, said Mr Chaiwut.<br>

				From https://telecoms.com/511032/oneweb-lobs-another-34-satellites-into-orbit/<br>
			</p>
			<p>OneWeb, the financial equivalent of a big black hole, has launched another load of broadband satellites into the big black.</p>
			<p>The UK-based company said on Sunday that it has successfully put a further 34 low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites into space, bringing its total to 288. It aims to offer global coverage at some point next year, expanding its fleet to 648.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are seeing huge demand for our services from global customers, and we are incredibly excited about scaling our network ahead of its commercial launch. This success is down to our talented team and partners around the world, who continue to work relentlessly every day to deliver OneWeb&rsquo;s constellation and bring connectivity to those in the hardest to reach places,&rdquo; said OneWeb CEO Neil Masterson, in a statement.</p>
			<p>This success can also be attributed in part to successive rounds of eye-watering investments that have saved OneWeb from bankruptcy and fully funded its network deployment.</p>
			<p>Earlier this month, South Korean conglomerate Hanwha became the latest punter to buy into OneWeb, paying $300 million for an undisclosed stake and a seat on the company&rsquo;s board. A few months ago, French satellite player Eutelsat invested $550 million into OneWeb.</p>
			<p>Lest anyone forget, in 2020, OneWeb was on the verge of oblivion. Having spent $3.4 billion of investors&rsquo; money, the company went bankrupt last March. It was brought back from the brink last November by the UK government and India&rsquo;s Bharti Global, which each paid $500 million for the privilege. The latter recently announced it will exercise a call option later this year that will see it invest a further $500 million into OneWeb.</p>
			<p>Once that option is exercised, OneWeb will have raised $3.2 billion since its November rescue. Add to that the $3.4 billion that has already &#150; and quite literally &#150; gone into the ether, and the aptness of the financial black hole analogies becomes obvious.</p>
			<p>But then, satellite broadband is an expensive game to play. Starlink, the satellite broadband company owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, aims to deliver coverage in hard-to-reach areas with a constellation that will eventually number in the tens of thousands. Musk recently told the audience at this year&rsquo;s Mobile World Congress that he expects Starlink to burn through $5-$10 billion by the time it turns cash-flow positive. Investments in ongoing improvements and technological advancements could take that spend up to $20-$30 billion over time, he said.</p>
			<p>Despite the high upfront costs, there appears to be no shortage of interest in satellite broadband.</p>
			<p>In July, Inmarsat announced plans to create a so-called multi-orbit constellation comprised of 150 satellites. The UK-based satellite operator plans to invest at least $100 million into the project.</p>
			<p>Earlier that same month, a consortium consisting of Virgin Media O2, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Darwin Innovation Group, revealed they have been testing a device pitched at connected vehicles that automatically switches between 5G and satellite connectivity depending on availability.</p>
			<p>Use cases like this are fuelling demand for ubiquitous coverage delivered from orbit. According to Northern Sky Research (NSR), the influx of satellite broadband players will contribute to the manufacture and launch of almost 24,700 satellites over the next decade. Investors like Hanwha, Bharti and the UK government will expect a healthy return on their outlay, but with so many players and competing constellations, there can be no guarantees.<br>

					From https://news.satnews.com/2021/08/22/arianespace-propels-34-oneweb-constellation-satellites-to-orbit/?mohide=true&amp;mc_cid=72ea5dd3e1&amp;mc_eid=e80892f101<br>
				</p>
				<p>Flight ST34 was the 59th Soyuz mission carried out by Arianespace and their Starsem affiliate. The mission lasted three hours and 45 minutes.</p>
				<p>The 34 satellites have been separated, during nine separation sequences, at an altitude of 450 km. This was also the third successful launch operated by Arianespace&rsquo;s teams in less than one month.</p>
				<p>To date, Arianespace has launched 288 OneWeb satellites with nine Soyuz launches. Arianespace will perform 10 more Soyuz launches for OneWeb through 2021 and 2022. These launches will enable OneWeb to complete the deployment of their full global constellation of LEO satellites before the end of 2022.</p>
				<p>OneWeb&rsquo;s mission is to create a global connectivity platform through a next-generation satellite constellation in LEO. This constellation will deliver high-speed, low-latency connectivity to a wide range of customer sectors, including aviation, maritime, enterprise and government. Central to its purpose, OneWeb seeks to bring connectivity to the hardest to reach places, where fiber cannot reach, and thereby bridge the digital divide. The satellite prime contractor is OneWeb Satellites, a joint venture of OneWeb and Airbus Defence and Space. The satellites were produced in Florida, USA, in the company&rsquo;s satellite manufacturing facilities that can build as many as two satellites per day on a series production line that is dedicated to spacecraft assembly, integration and testing.</p>
				<p>The launch of the satellites was operated by Arianespace and its Euro-Russian affiliate Starsem under contract with Glavkosmos, a subsidiary of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency. Arianespace is responsible for the overall mission and flight-worthiness, with the support of Starsem for launch campaign activities, including management of their own launch facilities at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.</p>
				<p>RKTs-Progress (the Samara Space Center) is responsible for the design, development, manufacture and integration of the Soyuz launch vehicle as well as for the 3-stage Soyuz flight. NPO Lavotchkin is responsible for the launch preparation operations and flight of the Fregat orbital vehicle.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Congratulations to all the teams who made this ninth launch dedicated to OneWeb&rsquo;s satellites a success,&rdquo; said St&eacute;phane Isra&euml;l, CEO of Arianespace. &ldquo;Every single mission is special, but ST34 is the demonstration of our ability, no matter when or where, to deliver the best possible service! We operated three successful launches from two continents in precisely 23 days -less than one month-, with three different launchers, Ariane 5, Vega and Soyuz. Any time, any mass, any orbit: this is once again what we achieved to the benefit of our customers.&rdquo;<br>

			</p>
			<p>AT&amp;T&rsquo;s TV broadband products, including its NOW service, will this week change to DirecTV Stram as part of the shift to a relaunch as a standalone business under new investor TPG Capital.</p>
			<p>Most subscribers to the AT&amp;T-branded OTT services started to receive official notifications of the change on August 14th, and warned of the name change which is due on August 26th.</p>
			<p>Under this new company, DirecTV owns and operates the former AT&amp;T US and Puerto Rico video business unit consisting of satellite, streaming and IP video services.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is a watershed moment for DirecTV as we return to a singular focus on providing a stellar video experience,&rdquo; said Bill Morrow, CEO, DirecTV. &ldquo;Building on our recent momentum, we are well-positioned to bring unparalleled choice and value to all of our customers under one iconic brand, whether they beam it or stream it.&rdquo;</p>
			<p> &ldquo;AT&amp;T satellite, streaming or IP video customers will automatically keep their video service, any bundled wireless, internet or HBO Max services, and associated discounts with no action needed,&rdquo; advised AT&amp;T. &ldquo;For those who stream it, the newly branded DirecTV Stream will become the single brand for video streaming services previously launched by AT&amp;T, excluding HBO Max.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/08/23/curiositystream-rebrands-as-curiosity/<br>
			</p>
			<p>US factual company CuriosityStream is rebranding itself with the shortened name Curiosity, while its flagship SVOD service is now to be retitled Curiosity Stream.</p>
			<p>The Maryland-based firm says the move is to better reflect the &ldquo;dynamic and diverse business&rdquo; that it has grown into after more than six years of operation.</p>
			<p>Aside from its streaming service, Curiosity is also comprised of the linear Curiosity Channel, originals prodco Curiosity Studios and the recently acquired One Day University.</p>
			<p>As TBI reported exclusively last month, Curiosity is launching a new linear network in Europe after agreeing a deal with German media group Spiegel, while in June, the company inked a deal for more than 80 hours of new programming from millennial-focused channel operator and producer Insight TV.</p>
			<p>This movement follows rapid expansion for the company, with a 120% increase in total revenue last year and a 50% rise in its SVOD subscriber base to approximately 15 million at the end of Q4 2020, compared to around 10 million at the same point in 2019.</p>
			<p>The streamer, which reaches more than 175 countries, specialises in factual content, ranging from science and technology to history, natural history and lifestyle programming. It has a library of more than 3,000 on-demand titles, including more than 900 originals such as Pompeii: Disaster Street, Prehistoric Worlds and Stephen Hawking&rsquo;s Favorite Places.</p>
			<p>The company went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in October last year, following a merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Software Acquisition Group &#150; that left the company well capitalised, with zero debt and an estimated $180m of cash on the balance sheet on closing.</p>
			<p>At the time, president and CEO Clint Stinchcomb told DTVE sister publication TBI that the company planned to increase its content library up to 12,000 titles over the next five years, through a mix of original programming and acquisitions.<br>

				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/08/23/wurl-riding-ctv-and-fast-wave-to-growth/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Streaming TV technology provider Wurl saw a 38% increase in revenue in Q2 of this year over the first quarter, which it said was down to growth in connected TV and free ad-supported TV (FAST) channels and platform.  The company did not publish its actual top line numbers, however.</p>
			<p>All key areas of Wurl&rsquo;s business &#150; content, viewers, viewing time and ad impressions &#150; also helped its  revenue grow threefold over Q2 last year, the company said.</p>
			<p>In Q2, Wurl said it launched over 274 new FAST channels, which the company claimed as a new milestone. Nearly 1,200 channels are now being distributed to CTV and FAST platforms around the world.</p>
			<p>Wurl&rsquo;s AdSpring service, which manages the routing of ad requests, targeting, insertion and measurement, saw impressions rise by 43% in Q2 compared to Q1, according to the company.</p>
			<p>CTV and FAST platforms that began integrations with the Wurl network in Q2 included Xiaomi, Zeasn, and Tubi.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;New channel launches are the main reason for our overall growth; attracting new viewers, driving up hours of viewing and attracting more advertisers. Most channel launches came from our top 50 customers, who are building on their initial success and are expanding globally. They know we have a proven track record of deploying quickly to accelerate the revenue generating potential of their content,&rdquo; said Sean Doherty, CEO, Wurl.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The Wurl Network provides connectivity for any content company or streaming application to become part of the global television backbone that we&rsquo;ve created. Since our launch in 2017, we&rsquo;ve been adding new services that run on the Wurl Network and make our network more useful and valuable for everyone. We have much more in store for this year so watch this space.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.sportsvideo.org/2021/08/18/tennis-channel-continues-international-expansion-in-united-kingdom-india/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Tennis Channel&rsquo;s international expansion continues with the launch of its Tennis Channel subscription streaming service in the U.K. on Thursday, Aug. 19, and the introduction of the Tennis Channel International ad-supported streaming channel on Samsung TV Plus in India Wednesday, Aug. 25. Tennis Channel launched its direct-to-consumer streaming platform in May 2020, which is also available in Austria, Germany, Greece, and Switzerland.</p>
			<p>Last year, Tennis Channel International debuted a new 24-hour streamed programming channel, Tennis Channel Deutschland, the first in Germany devoted exclusively to tennis. Programming also includes original Tennis Channel series, documentaries, features, instruction, highlights, and select matches on-demand. Tennis Channel International will also cover live competition from Tennis Bundesliga, Germany&rsquo;s top team tennis league. Archived content will feature hundreds of hours of programming from numerous providers, including founding partners the International Tennis Federation (ITF), and German Tennis Federation (Deutscher Tennis Bund &#150; DTB), and will be available on-demand. Tennis Channel and the ITF are developing an ITF channel for the platform as well.</p>
			<p>Users will also be able to follow every professional tennis match in the world through Sportradar&rsquo;s MatchCast, a channel with never-before-seen dynamic graphics and more tennis statistics and data than anything currently available in the sport.<br>

			<p><b><i>SpaceX requests FCC approval on new Starlink orbits <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/08/20/spacex-requests-fcc-approval-on-new-starlink-orbits/<br>
			</p>
			<p>SpaceX has submitted orbital modifications to its &lsquo;next generation&rsquo; Starlink satellites to the FCC. If approved, the new Generation 2 Starlink craft will be able to offer higher-density services to rural areas.</p>
			<p>SpaceX has proposed two variants to the FCC and will await the Commission&rsquo;s verdict/approval before proceeding with a modification to its existing satellite operational use.</p>
			<p>The Elon Musk-backed company, in an August 18th filing to the FCC, state that it does not need extra frequency rights, but that the proposals come from its own work and observations, and the potential use of SpaceX&rsquo;s giant Starship. Starship could launch more satellites in one mission than the existing Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
			<p>The FCC application states: &ldquo;While the original constellation provides unprecedented capacity for a satellite system, the demand for more broadband continues to grow unabated and the need for user connectivity has never been more important.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The application adds: &ldquo;SpaceX has found ways to leverage the advanced capabilities of its new launch vehicle, Starship, that has increased capability to deliver more mass to orbit quickly and efficiently and, combined with reuse capability of the upper stage, launch more often. With this increased potential, Starship allows SpaceX to better position satellites to meet changing consumer demand.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The differences are potentially significant.</p>
			<p>Configuration 1 (and SpaceX&rsquo;s preferred option) sees a total of 29,988 satellites being deployed in inclined orbit at altitudes of between 340 &#150; 614 kms and operating in nine different altitudes.</p>
			<p>Configuration 2 would stay with the current Falcon 9 rocket and uses almost the exact same number of satellites (29,996) but operating at 12 different altitudes and 12 different orbital inclinations.</p>
			<p>The current FCC permissions allow for some 30,000 satellites. The new satellite versions would, says SpaceX, be slightly heavier and have more power as well as using inter-satellite optical/laser links. The new craft would also have improved (reduced) reflectivity and thus make Earth-bound astronomers a little happier.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Australian multiplay telco Optus says it is raising the bar on innovation with the introduction of Optus SubHub, describing it as a &ldquo;world-first game-changer&rdquo; that simplifies content subscriptions and memberships by putting them in one place and allowing eligible Optus customers to save money and discover new content options.</p>
			<p>SubHub complements the recently announced Optus Living Network strategy, putting customers in control of how they personalise their technology and telco experience with unique network features.<br>
				 <br>
				&ldquo;The pitch is simple &#150; in an increasingly complex and growing universe of digital content subscriptions, our customers tell us that they find it hard to keep track of exactly what subscriptions they have, are active, and how much they pay for them,&rdquo; explained Clive Dickens, Optus TV&rsquo;s Content and Product Development VP, &ldquo;With SubHub, we have turned the table on complexity with a single platform allowing customers to bundle their multiple new and existing subscriptions, enjoy them as they need them and pause them when they don&rsquo;t, with just a few clicks.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Customers will be able to access their content subscriptions and digital memberships through Optus&rsquo;s My Optus App and www.SubHub.com.au.</p>
			<p>Dickens advised that the launch of SubHub will include complimentary trial content subscriptions for customers, who can also then earn up to 10 per cent off when they bundle multiple paid content subscriptions in the new SubHub platform. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re upping the ante on simplicity and value by reducing customers&rsquo; content subscription costs through SubHub &#150; which is great news if you want to save money, and even better news if you want to avoid subscription FOMO and subscribe to even more must-have content &#150; but may not have previously been able to justify it,&rdquo; he added.</p>
			<p>Optus will launch SubHub with subscriptions and memberships available from a number of providers including Amazon Australia (Prime membership which includes access to free shipping on Prime eligible orders, Prime Video, Prime Gaming, Amazon Music, Prime Reading and more) and Kindle Unlimited which brings you millions of titles and thousands of audiobooks, in addition to health and wellbeing partner Calm, the leading mental wellness brand with the #1 app for sleep, meditation and relaxation.</p>

			<p><b><i>Rocket Lab to Launch Four PocketQube Satellites for Alba Orbital<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From  Release From: RocketLab<br>
			</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab, a leading launch provider and space systems company, today announced it has signed a rideshare agreement with Scottish / American PocketQube satellite manufacturer, Alba Orbital, to launch a cluster of small satellites designed to demonstrate innovative radio and night-time Earth observation technologies. </p>
			<p>The four pico-satellites in Alba Orbital&rsquo;s cluster will fly as part of a rideshare mission on Rocket Lab&rsquo;s Electron launch vehicle, lifting-off from Launch Complex 1 on New Zealand&rsquo;s Mahia Peninsula in Q4, 2021. The cluster includes Alba Orbital&rsquo;s own Unicorn-2 PocketQube satellites, as well as the TRSI-2, TRSI-3, and MyRadar-1 satellites for Alba Orbital&rsquo;s customers. Each small satellite carries a unique sensor designed to demonstrate innovative technologies on orbit. </p>
			<p>Unicorn-2 will be carrying an optical night-time imaging payload designed to monitor light pollution across the globe. Night-time satellite imagery, otherwise known as &lsquo;Night Lights&rsquo; data, provides crucial insights into human activities. This data enables a host of applications such as tracking urbanization and socioeconomic dynamics, evaluating conflict and disasters, investigating fisheries, assessing greenhouse gas emissions and energy use, and analyzing light pollution and health effects.</p>
			<p>All four PocketQubes will be deployed to a circular orbit by Electron&rsquo;s Kick Stage, a nimble spacecraft that provides in-space propulsion and maneuvering capability to ensure each satellite is deployed to a precise and unique orbit defined by the customer.   </p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re delighted to be Alba Orbital&rsquo;s mission partner once again,&rdquo; said Rocket Lab Founder and Chief Executive, Peter Beck. &ldquo;The Alba Orbital team have proven that incredibly small satellites can be highly capable and deliver tangible insights and services back down to Earth at a fraction of traditional satellite costs. Making it faster, easier and more affordable to access space is a mission we share, so we&rsquo;re excited to make it possible with Electron.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure to be working with Rocket Lab again on this exciting mission,'' said Tom Walkinshaw, CEO and Founder of Alba Orbital. &ldquo;We successfully flew six satellites on board Rocket Lab&rsquo;s &lsquo;Running Out of Fingers&rsquo; flight in 2019, and we are thrilled to launch the first of our imaging constellation dedicated to imaging the Earth at night on board the Electron rocket. From day one, Alba Orbital&rsquo;s mission has always been to democratize access to space, and Rocket Lab has demonstrated that they are whole-heartedly committed to the same vision.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The Alba cluster joins this mission alongside AuroraSat-1 from Aurora Propulsion Technologies, a Finnish company dedicated to the sustainable use of space. The mission is one of many scheduled to lift off on Electron from Launch Complex 1 this year, including three back-to-back dedicated launches for BlackSky Global, and the CAPSTONE mission to the Moon in support of NASA&rsquo;s Artemis program. </p>

			<p>China successfully launched the Tianhui II-02 satellite group at 6:32 a.m. on Thursday from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in northern China's Shanxi province.</p>
			<p>The satellite group was carried by a Long March-4B carrier rocket and then entered the planned orbit.</p>

				From https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3145506/chinese-satellite-fell-apart-march-was-hit-debris-russian-rocket?module=perpetual_scroll&amp;pgtype=article&amp;campaign=3145506<br>
			</p>
			<p>Twenty-one pieces broke off the weather probe and while signals are said to have been detected, it is not known if it is still functioning<br>
				Astrophysicist says it was struck by objects from a rocket launched in 1996, and low-Earth orbit &lsquo;will see an increased risk of collision&rsquo; in future</p>
			<p>Five months ago, a Chinese weather satellite suddenly disintegrated.</p>
			<p>It was not clear why, but 21 pieces broke off from the probe on March 18, according to a tweet days later from the US Space Force&rsquo;s 18th Space Control Squadron, which monitors artificial objects in Earth&rsquo;s orbit.</p>
			<p>Yunhai 1-02 had been sent into orbit from the Gobi Desert in September 2019 &#150; its mission to observe oceans, the atmosphere and space<br>
				, and to prevent and mitigate disasters.</p>
			<p>Chinese media seized on speculation online that its fate was related to US weather satellite NOAA-17, which had broken apart 10 days before and created debris.</p>
			<p>The China National Space Administration did not release a statement on the incident at the time.</p>
			<p>But on Sunday, astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell found the culprit: Yunhai 1-02 was hit by debris from a Russian rocket that launched a military radio surveillance satellite, Tselina-2, in 1996.<br>
				&ldquo;37 debris objects &#x2026; have been catalogued so far from the break-up &#150; there are likely to be more. This looks to be the first major confirmed orbital collision in a decade,&rdquo; McDowell, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in the US, said in a tweet.<br>
				How China&rsquo;s space programme went from launching satellites to building its own space station</p>
			<p>Collisions with space debris in low-Earth orbit &#150; less than 2,000km (1,240 miles) above the Earth&rsquo;s surface &#150; remain a concern for space agencies worldwide. The increasing density of space junk makes launches more difficult and can render satellites unusable if they smash into something.</p>
			<p>Scientists are also concerned about the Kessler syndrome &#150; a chain reaction in which collisions produce more debris, which in turn makes collisions more likely.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are faced with a future in which low-Earth orbit will see an increased amount of debris and increased risk of collision and an increased number of serious collisions,&rdquo; McDowell said.</p>
			<p>It could reach a stage where there is so much space junk that it becomes too difficult to operate in low-Earth orbit. But the astrophysicist said this scenario could be avoided if large and abandoned satellites and rocket stages were cleaned up in the next few decades.</p>
			<p>When satellites collide with each other in orbit it can produce thousands of pieces of debris. However, that space debris can be removed by putting it on a re-entry trajectory so that it burns up in the atmosphere, though these operations are expensive because the satellites are on different orbital inclinations.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually very expensive in fuel to change from one inclination to another. And you probably need a different garbage satellite mission for every inclination range,&rdquo; McDowell said, adding that countries were still experimenting in isolation on such missions.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do a little and we&rsquo;ll just keep it on the edge of being OK,&rdquo; he said of how governments were likely to handle the problem of space junk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m basing that on how we&rsquo;ve dealt with every other environmental problem that humanity&rsquo;s ever faced.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>McDowell discovered what happened to Yunhai 1-02 after seeing a note on the Space-Track.org website, which publishes orbital data and is run by the US Combined Force Space Component Command.</p>
			<p>The note said debris labelled as &ldquo;object 48078&rdquo; had &ldquo;collided with satellite&rdquo;. The object &#150; a fragment of the Zenit-2 Russian rocket used to launch surveillance satellites &#150; was added to the website&rsquo;s object catalogue in March, when Yunhai 1-02 broke up.</p>
			<p>The Chinese satellite and object 48078 had passed within 1km of each other &#150; within the tracking system&rsquo;s margin of error &#150; at 7.41am Coordinated Universal Time on March 18, McDowell said on Twitter.</p>
			<p>Amateur astronomers say they have detected signals from Yunhai 1-02 since the break-up and orbital corrections have been observed, but the extent to which the satellite remains functional is unknown.</p>

			<p><b><i>NBTC decides to scrap Aug 28 auction<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2167463/nbtc-decides-to-scrap-aug-28-auction<br>
			</p>
			<p>The National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) has cancelled its planned auction of four satellite orbital slot packages slated for Aug 28, saying the participation of only one contender in the auction cannot create fair competition.</p>
			<p>TC Space Connect, wholly owned by SET-listed satellite service provider Thaicom, was the sole contender in the auction.</p>
			<p>The NBTC board also instructed its management to return the bid guarantee placed by TC Space Connect and bid envelope fees to all the parties that purchased them.</p>
			<p>Trairat Viriyasirikul, acting secretary-general of the NBTC, said the board assigned management to adjust the principles and methods of the auction to create better conditions.</p>
			<p>The move, he said, should ensure fair competition and that national resources are used for the optimum benefit of the country, based on the constitution.</p>
			<p>Another goal is to ward off risk that satellite orbital slots will be taken from Thailand if they are left unused, in line with the principles of the Master International Frequency Register, said Mr Trairat.</p>
			<p>Four satellite orbital slot packages were to be auctioned. The first package consisted of 50.5&deg;East and 51&deg;E orbital slots with a reserve price of 677 million baht; the second was 78.5&deg;E with a reserve price of 366.4 million; the third was 119.5&deg;E and 120&deg;E at 393 million; and the last was for 126&deg;E and 142&deg;E with a reserve price of 364.6 million.</p>
			<p>A source from NBTC management who requested anonymity said all conditions for the existing auction plan will have to be revised.</p>
			<p>&quot;It is likely a new auction will not have packages, but instead selective or specific slots,&quot; the source said.</p>
			<p>Under the current practice, a bidder bids for the packages it wants.</p>
			<p>The source said it remains unclear whether a new auction will be held.</p>
			<p>The NBTC originally scheduled the auction for July 24, but only TC Space Connect placed a bid request and a bank guarantee to join the bidding.</p>
			<p>Mu Space and Advanced Technology, a local satellite and space tech firm, failed to submit a bid request by the deadline on July 5, despite earlier buying a bid envelope.</p>
			<p>On July 7, the NBTC board resolved to postpone the event until Aug 28, giving a new opportunity for interested parties to join in.</p>
			<p>National Telecom bought a bid envelope for the auction on Aug 6, which was the final day to do so, but failed to submit a bid request by the Aug 11 deadline.</p>
			<p>Digital Economy and Society (DES) Minister Chaiwut Thanakamanusorn had previously called on the NBTC to postpone the auction until new members of the NBTC board are appointed.</p>
			<p>The recruitment of new board members has begun.</p>
			<p>Mr Chaiwut said the auction involves many slots, including 119.5&deg;E and 78.5&deg;E, both of which are still occupied under the DES Ministry's concession.</p>
			<p>The former is being used by the Thaicom 4 satellite, while the latter was previously used by the Thaicom 5 satellite, which has been deorbited.<br>

			</p>
			<p>A new locally made micro-satellite developed by experts at the Vietnam National Space Centre (VNSC) has been completed and send to Japan for launching into orbit. Vietnam&rsquo;s NanoDragon satellite was delivered ahead of its planned launch into outer space, according to VNSC. The satellite will be transferred to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). It was developed with the purpose of demonstrating it can use micro-satellite beam technology to receive automatic identification system (AIS) signals of ships to track and monitor vehicles at sea.</p>
			<p>VNSC is run under the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology. According to a news report, it is the result of the nano-class satellite development, launch, and trial operation project, under the National Science and Technology Programme on space technology, from 2016 to 2020. The process of researching, designing, integrating, and testing the satellite&rsquo;s functions was carried out entirely in Vietnam by VNSC researchers.</p>
			<p>The NanoDragon satellite (NDG) is a nano-layer CubeSat satellite. It weighs 3.8 kilograms and is made up of multiple 10&times;10&times;34 cm (3U) modules. It is expected to be launched into orbit from the Uchinoura Space Centre in Kagoshima prefecture in the fiscal year 2021 (to March 2022). The centre noted that after the manufacturing, integration, and functional testing were conducted in Vietnam earlier this year, the satellite passed the pre-launch environmental testing at the Kyushu Institute of Technology in Japan. Additionally, the satellite has been designed to verify the quality of the satellite posture and control system and a newly developed advanced onboard computer designed specifically for small satellites. It will be working on Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) at 560 km above the Earth&rsquo;s surface.</p>
			<p>Along with the satellite development process, a ground station to operate the satellite after its launch has been installed and ready for operation at the VNSC in the Hoa Lac Hi-Tech Park in Hanoi. Previously, the VNSC also successfully developed the 1-kg-microsatellite PicoDragon, and the 50-kg satellite MicroDragon, which were launched into orbit in 2013 and 2019, respectively.</p>
			<p>Before NanoDragon, the first made-in-Vietnam satellite, PicoDragon, was successfully launched with signals received in 2013. MicroDragon, developed by VNSC researchers under Japanese experts&rsquo; supervision, was sent into orbit in 2019. It successfully sent pictures from space to its ground station in Japan.</p>
			<p>Last month, a virtual programme was held to promote connections for technology supply and demand between Vietnamese and Japanese businesses. The event was hosted by the Science Technology Development and Innovation Centre (ISC) under the Department of Science and Technology of the northern port city of Hai Phong. As OpenGov Asia had reported, the event saw the participation of 12 enterprises from industrial and technological centres of Japan such as Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima, and Nagoya. They introduced different technologies, including equipment for mechanical processing, automation technology, and technologies for agricultural production and farm produce processing, among others.</p>
			<p>After the event, the organiser assisted the businesses of the two sides to negotiate and sign contracts. ISC said a similar event is scheduled to be held in September this year to connect businesses of Vietnam and the Netherlands. So far, ISC has organised hundreds of events to connect Vietnamese enterprises with technology supply and transfer partners in many countries with developed science and technology such as Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, and Russia.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.rapidtvnews.com/2021081761054/telstra-forges-partnership-with-base-media-cloud.html#ixzz73pLtDJcY<br>
			</p>
			<p>Targeting the Asia-Pacific market with a new range of cloud-native broadcast services, Telstra Broadcast Services (TBS) has entered into a sales partnership with BASE Media Cloud (BASE).</p>
			<p>UK-based BASE is a provider of cloud services for the digital media industry and its combined services with TBS are designed to allow the newly established Telstra MediaCloud to provide what the partners say will be a complete end-to-end cloud-native workflow from ingest, cloud storage, file transfer and asset management through to virtual post-production and file delivery.</p>
			<p>Noting interest in cloud-based workflows accelerating as a result of the pandemic, TBS says it will be able to leverage BASE&rsquo;s expertise to provide a production proven suite of tailored remote working services. These include cloud storage, file transfer, transcoding, and cloud-native asset management through to virtual Adobe editing, custom Artificial Intelligence, and content distribution SaaS services. All of these will be offered as part of the established Telstra MediaCloud package to Telstra customers.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Leading cloud-based editing and post services represent the start of what we can do in our partnership with BASE,&rdquo; comments TBS&rsquo; Paul Slowey. &ldquo;Our new ability to deliver complete end-to-end workflows allows us to offer a more fully-featured cloud consultancy service than ever before, and gives us the capacity to cope with digital transformation and cloud-migration projects for broadcasters of any size.&rdquo;<br>
				For its part, BASE will get to further drive its international expansion plans via a strategic channel partner, building further on its established position in the UK market &#151; where cloud subscription partners include BBC, ITV, Formula E, Little Dot Studios and LadBible Group &#151; and strengthening footholds on both the US east and west coasts.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are delighted to be collaborating with Telstra Broadcast Services to roll out these new services first to the Australian market and then on to the rest of APAC,&rdquo; says BASE Media Cloud&rsquo;s founder and managing director, Ben Foakes. &ldquo;We believe the combination of Telstra&rsquo;s expertise in networking and infrastructure and our Software-as-a-Service subscription layer and media-focused cloud expertise provides a compelling solution as more and more broadcasters seek to take advantage of cloud-based workflows.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The new services will be initially rolled out to the Australian industry, with plans for expansion to the rest of APAC following soon after.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.fijivillage.com/news/Construction-of-4-key-transmission-sites-will-free-up-radio-frequencies-for-telecommunications-networks-fr845x/<br>
			</p>
			<p>All TV broadcasters, free to air and pay per view, to become tenants on Walesi after the analogue to digital switch over</p>
			<p>Attorney-General and Minister for Communications, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum says with a budgetary allocation of $4.5 million, Walesi is well placed now with the deployment of the FM radio network.</p>
			<p>Sayed-Khaiyum says this will allow people to listen to their favourite radio station on the same frequency from anywhere in Fiji and also free up radio frequencies for other purposes like telecommunications networks.</p>
			<p>He says the intention is for Walesi services to expand to look after all broadcasting transmission, television and FM services.</p>
			<p>Sayed-Khaiyum says this will provide economies of scale and ensure that all national linking and transmission sites are well serviced by utilities and connectivity.</p>
			<p>He says this will also mean that all broadcasters will not only enjoy enhanced reach and better technical support, but also reduce the high operating cost on maintaining sites that have poor or no utility services and connectivity.</p>
			<p>He says the allocation to Walesi will fund the construction of four key transmission sites.</p>
			<p>The sites at Nakobalevu in Suva and Sabeto in Nadi are expected to be commissioned by November this year.</p>
			<p>Sayed-Khaiyum says the other two scheduled to be commissioned by March 2022 are the Koro transmission site in Tavua and the Delaikoro site in Labasa.</p>
			<p>Sayed-Khaiyum says the brown out or black out zones that are currently experienced when travelling in areas such as Pacific Harbour and the Coral Coast in Viti Levu or areas like Bua and Savusavu in Vanua Levu will be a thing of the past.</p>
			<p>The Attorney General says building a common shared network will give other smaller broadcasters such as community and faith based radio stations the same competitive advantage as other commercial radio stations.</p>
			<p>He says very soon Walesi app users will be able to access radio services on the app which is scheduled to be completed by November this year.</p>
			<p>Sayed-Khaiyum says Walesi is now focused on ensuring that all eligible households have the prospect to obtain the Walesi equipment to prepare for the analogue to digital switch over.</p>
			<p>He says the switch over will progressively be carried out nationwide beginning from Navua, Korovou and the Lautoka Nadi corridor by the 1st of December of year and then the remaining areas of Viti Levu, Vanua Levu and all the maritime islands will follow.</p>
			<p>Sayed-Khaiyum also says the analogue to digital switchover date means that all the TV broadcasters will cease to transmit on the analogue platform.</p>
			<p>He says this will regularize current practice and mandates that all TV broadcasters, free to air and pay per view, become tenants of the Walesi platform and Walesi will offer all tenants equitable access and geographical reach.<br>

			<p><b><i>RSCC Alters The Express-AM33 Satellite&rsquo;s Orbital Slot<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://news.satnews.com/2021/08/17/rscc-alters-the-express-am33-satellites-orbital-slot/?mohide=true&amp;mc_cid=287d504011&amp;mc_eid=e80892f101<br>
			</p>
			<p>Specialists of the Ops Dept of the Russian Satellite Communications Company (RSCC) orbital constellation have completed the translation of the Express-AM33 satellite from the orbital position of 96.5&deg; E to the 11&deg; W slot.</p>
			<p>To translate the Express-AM33 to the required position, the satellite had made 120 orbits around the Earth at an altitude of 35,880 km, covering 31.7 million km in the process.</p>
			<p>The most difficult and precise work was performed by 41 employees of the RSCC Mission Control Centers located in Moscow, Zheleznogorsk, and Dubna Space Communication Centers as well as the Vladimir Satellite Communication Station.</p>
			<p>For four months, specialists provided round-the-clock control of the satellite, updating its trajectory as needed. From August 17, 2021 the Express-AM33 has been ready for operation.</p>
			<p>Now, in most of the Atlantic Ocean, the crews and passengers of sea-going ships have obtained access to the internet and communication services, which have been provided even in the most extreme conditions. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;Sixty-nine percent of the Earth&rsquo;s surface is controlled by our orbital constellation of 12 geostationary satellites. They are maneuverable enough to swiftly address the problems posed by the market. Should our clients want to get communication services right in the middle of the ocean, such services will be available to them. According to surveys, contemplating a contract and selecting a vessel, up to 92 percent of seamen stress as one of decision-making factors the availability of an affordable, reliable connectivity, including Internet. They need that to be able to communicate with their families and relatives without any constraints. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we have brought the Express-AM33 satellite to a new orbital position from the Eastern Hemisphere to the Western, so that passenger and cargo vehicles, as well as yachts on cross-Atlantic routes, could use the communications services made available by Russian Satellite Communications Company &#151; and on the best terms, too,&rdquo; said Alexey Volin, General Director of RSCC.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/08/17/thailand-fails-to-find-more-satellite-bidders/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Thailand&rsquo;s attempt to encourage more bidders for the nation&rsquo;s orbital satellite slots has failed.</p>
			<p>TC Space Connect, a subsidiary of existing incumbent Thaicom, is again the sole bidder. National Telecom (NT) has not proceeded with a bid.</p>
			<p>The official auction is due to be held on August 28th. The existing satellite concession for Thaicom ends on September 10th.</p>
			<p>NT, despite &ldquo;buying&rdquo; a qualifying bid envelope on August 6th failed to carry its bid forward and did not follow up with its banker&rsquo;s guarantee.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Participating in the satellite orbital slot auction is not the only way to operate a satellite business,&rdquo; the NT source told the Bangkok Post. &ldquo;NT can do it through other models, such as operating a satellite gateway business for foreign satellites or forming a partnership with others to provide satellite services. Building a new geostationary satellite and sending it to space is not a favourable option for NT because it is hard to expect a return from the investment.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Insight TV and the switch to digital<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/longread/insight-tv-and-the-switch-to-digital/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Up until recently, it seemed that  linear TV  &#150; especially those channels targeting a younger demographic &#150; would soon become an endangered species, with viewing migrating to on-demand, online platforms.</p>
			<p>However, the linear channel is undergoing something of a renaissance with the growth of free ad-supported TV, or FAST channels, highlighting an apparent lingering desire for a more leaned-back experience among consumers on digital platforms.</p>
			<p>Certainly, building and maintaining a successful TV channel business today is more complicated than it used to be, and requires constant reinvention.</p>
			<p>Insight TV began life as a showcase for 4K UHD, but has more recently transmogrified into a youth-focused offering, with a clear strategy to try to navigate the shifting sands of the digital distribution and monetisation landscape.</p>
			<p>Natalie Boot</p>
			<p>According to Natalie Boot, VP of sales at Insight TV and VP of Insight TV Studios USA, the broadcaster has switched its focus from traditional pay TV distribution to &ldquo;a more omnichannel strategy&rdquo; just as its content has evolved to attract &ldquo;a millennial and Gen-Z audience&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>The strategy is fairly straightforward on one level: maintain a declining or static pay TV business while expanding on digital platforms.  Insight TV has grown its reach on the latter to 40 million a month, accounting for the bulk of viewing, with expansion on connected TV and social media channels offsetting a lack of growth in traditional pay TV.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In pay TV we see a small decline in revenue. The shows we are focusing on are aimed at younger audiences and advertising brands are focusing on switching ad spend to FAST channels and connected TV and social. FAST and connected TV are the fastest growing for us, while it&rsquo;s early days on social media,&rdquo; says Boot.</p>
			<p>Insight TV operates traditional linear, digital and VOD channels, and Boot says she has seen &ldquo;a small shift&rdquo; in advertising to digital linear and connected TV, while pay TV platforms have delivered &ldquo;a small decline&rdquo;. This movement has however been accompanied by a shift in the channel&rsquo;s content to appeal to a younger demographic. Brands targeting that audience are more likely to focus on digital advertising.</p>
			<p>Within the new landscape that Insight TV now more the most part inhabits, there are clear leaders among the potential platforms on which to distribute.</p>
			<p>For Boot, Samsung TV is the most important, with a technology platform and reach that sets it apart.</p>
			<p>ViacomCBS&rsquo;s FAST channel offering Pluto TV is also an important distribution channel, as is Rakuten TV. The channel is also looking at new opportunities, in particular Samsung TV Plus&rsquo;s launch on mobile platforms and Chinse manufacturer Xiaomi&rsquo;s forthcoming launch of a similar TV offering.</p>
			<p>The omnichannel approach is not without its own challenges. Boot admits getting the right content mix to appeal to diverse audiences is complex.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The content mix is challenging for us,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Where connected TV is not available our focus is on more traditional ways of distributing content. In territories where we have both, sometimes we produce slightly different content line-ups for social media and FAST channels and old-fashioned long-form content for pay TV.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>As Insight TV, its target audience and television in general have evolved, the channel&rsquo;s original USP &#150; 4K UHD &#150; has faded from view in its marketing. Audiences used to viewing content on a mobile phone are less interested in the super-sharp resolution that makes sense on a large flat-screen.</p>
			<p>In the world of FAST channels, Insight TV differentiates itself by &ldquo;connecting the global community&rdquo; around activities such as esports rather than by trying to focus on local content. At the same time, says Boot, Insight does not neglect localisation entirely. The channel airs some shows globally that are partly in Spanish language and then uses those segments to create a local version of that show specifically for Spanish language markets.</p>
			<p>Insight TV has also of late focused more on live events, particularly as a differentiator during the pandemic.</p>
			<p>Overall, Insight TV has shown that linear channels can survive the dramatic changes still taking place in the TV distribution landscape. The basic strategy is to try to hold onto the traditional business, which continues to deliver predictable revenues even as it frays at the edges, while expanding into the new digital universe of connected TV and FAST. In Insight TV&rsquo;s case, it has meant an evolution in the content of the channel too, as advertisers look to capture the attention of those difficult to reach Gen-Zers.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://news.satnews.com/2021/08/15/airbus-to-deliver-nexgen-milsatcom-for-australia/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter<br>
			</p>
			<p>Airbus has announced that Sydney, Australia-based, ground-control infrastructure specialist UGL will become the latest local partner to join the Airbus teaming arrangement in its bid to deliver next-generation military satellite communications (MILSATCOM) capability to Australia under the JP9102 program.</p>
			<p>The unique teaming arrangement &#150; called Team Maier &#150; seeks to identify Australian partners in the space, technology and academic sectors to provide innovative and specialized MILSATCOM capabilities as part of the JP9102 program.</p>
			<p>As well as delivering a MILSATCOM solution to the Australian Government, the teaming approach is designed to aid the development of a long-term sovereign defence and space eco-system and capability in Australia.</p>
			<p>A leading asset solutions provider, UGL would design and construct all ground infrastructure supporting the JP9102 project, including the communications systems, network operations and systems integration, as well as its ongoing sustainment.</p>
			<p>Team Maier will benefit from UGL&rsquo;s experience supporting the Australian Defence Force over the last two decades, including in the most recent upgrade works at the Royal Australian Navy communications and logistics facility at HMAS Harman.</p>
			<p>Under the partnership, Airbus will also be able to draw on more than 7,000 UGL engineering, construction, operations and maintenance specialists in developing its end-to-end JP9102 solution, while minimising risk and enhancing sovereign defence satellite capability.</p>
			<p>Peter Bierton, Head of Communications of UGL, said, &ldquo;We are excited to be joining Team Maier. Its focus on a truly Australian approach to military satcom capability resonates with our desire to develop and enhance sovereign capability. We believe this type of collaboration can be the catalyst for the Australian industry to develop international leadership in satcom. We are also looking forward to continuing our positive relationship with Barpa, bringing real value-add work directly to our Indigenous population.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Martin Rowse, Airbus Campaign Lead for the JP9102 program, said, &ldquo;UGL brings a wealth of experience and expertise to Team Maier and continues to drive our commitment to collaborate with true Australian companies. Airbus is looking forward to advancing these great discussions and development work with UGL. We also expect our respective capabilities to contribute to the best possible solution to meet Australia&rsquo;s satcom requirements.&rdquo;<br>

				From https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/08/15/luxembourg-denies-license-for-russias-rt-german-channel-a74794<br>
			</p>
			<p>Luxembourg has refused to grant a license for Russian state-backed network RT to broadcast a German-language channel from the country, the authorities said. </p>
			<p>&quot;The Luxembourg Department of Media, Telecommunications and Digital Policy concluded that Luxembourg is not the competent jurisdiction for 'RT auf Deutsch' as the technical criteria are not met,&quot; the office of Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said in a statement sent Saturday.</p>
			<p>&quot;As the broadcaster has an office in Germany and a significant part of the workforce involved in the pursuit of the audiovisual media service activity operates in Germany, 'RT auf Deutsch' is deemed to be under the jurisdiction of the Federal Republic of Germany.&quot;</p>
			<p>Kremlin-controlled RT &#151; formerly known as Russia Today &#151; applied for the satellite broadcasting license in Luxembourg in June to circumvent German regulations blocking licenses for state-owned foreign media. </p>
			<p>&quot;The Luxembourg government had a certain latitude to refuse the notification. It decided that it was not territorially competent given that all of RT's resources are in Berlin,&quot; Thierry Hoscheit, president of the Grand Duchy's independent audiovisual authority, told AFP. </p>
			<p>RT &#151; funded heavily by the Russian state &#151; is widely seen as part of the Kremlin's overseas propaganda efforts.<br>

			<p><b><i>Canada: Court rules against illicit STB providers <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/08/13/canada-court-rules-against-illicit-stb-providers/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Canadian multiplay telco Bell is one of a number of service providers to welcome a ruling by the Federal Court of Canada that orders a group of set-top box retailers to shut down operations and pay close to C$30 million (&euro;20m) in damages and costs for making content available without authorisation and inducing Canadians to access that content illegally.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Bell invests hundreds of millions of dollars every year to develop, produce, acquire and deliver great Canadian and international content over multiple platforms, but content piracy continues to undermine the entire media industry, including the work of many Canadians,&rdquo; said Wade Oosterman, President Bell Media and Vice Chair, BCE and Bell. &ldquo;By imposing stiff financial penalties on companies that enable and promote unauthorised access to content online and via set-top box add-ons, the Federal Court has sent a clear message.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>In its ruling, the Federal Court found that three set-top box retailers and one individual (a director with one of the retailers) had distributed, offered for sale, sold, operated and possessed equipment used or intended to enable unauthorised and illegal access to content. Noting that &ldquo;the growth of the illicit pre-loaded set-top box industry underscores the need to deter infringement&rdquo;, the Court granted permanent injunctions against the retailers and ordered them to pay statutory damages totalling C$29.3 million plus punitive damages and other costs.</p>
			<p>The Federal Court&rsquo;s decision is the direct result of legal action initiated by the media and distribution business unit of Bell and other media companies in Canada.</p>
			<p>The negative financial impact of TV piracy on Canadian broadcasters and distributors is in the range of C$500 million to C$650 million per year, affecting thousands of jobs across the industry. Added to this, an estimated one in three piracy websites contain malware that can put personal information &#150; for example, passwords and credit card information &#150; and other data on shared networks and devices at risk. This judgment sends a clear signal that other entities who enable illegal and unauthorised access to content will face stiff legal repercussions.</p>
			<p>To address the harms caused by the availability of illegal content, Bell supports a comprehensive approach that would include additional measures by the federal government and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to curb content piracy, such as facilitating the removal of stolen content from online platforms and the disabling of access to websites distributing illegal content.<br>

			<p><b><i>NT abandons bid for satellite orbital slot<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2164543/nt-abandons-bid-for-satellite-orbital-slot<br>
			</p>
			<p>TC Space remains sole auction entrant</p>
			<p>Mr Chaiwut says he never instructed NT to participate in the auction, but that it should have a strategy for the space economy.</p>
			<p>National Telecom (NT) has decided to turn its back on the satellite orbital slot auction slated for Aug 28, leaving TC Space Connect, wholly owned by SET-listed satellite service provider Thaicom, as the sole contender.</p>
			<p>NT, a merged unit of CAT Telecom and TOT, failed to submit its bid request with a bank guarantee by the Wednesday deadline.</p>
			<p>NT bought a bid envelope for the auction on Aug 6, which was the final day it could purchase one, fuelling speculation it might be interested in making a foray into the satellite business through the auction.</p>
			<p>A source from NT management who requested anonymity said the company bought the bid envelope to study all related conditions and requirements for the bid winners.</p>
			<p>&quot;Participating in the satellite orbital slot auction is not the only way to operate a satellite business,&quot; the source said.</p>
			<p>&quot;NT can do it through other models, such as operating a satellite gateway business for foreign satellites or forming a partnership with others to provide satellite services. Building a new geostationary satellite and sending it to space is not a favourable option for NT because it is hard to expect a return from the investment.&quot;</p>
			<p>Digital Economy and Society Minister Chaiwut Thanakamanusorn said he never instructed NT to participate in the auction.</p>
			<p>&quot;This is up to NT's management and board,&quot; he said.</p>
			<p>&quot;My only advice was NT should have a business strategy for the satellite business in the space economy.&quot;</p>
			<p>Mr Chaiwut said the satellite business is also a matter of national security.</p>
			<p>There are four satellite orbital slot packages up for auction.</p>
			<p>The first consists of 50.5&deg;East and 51&deg;E slots with a reserve price of 677 million baht; the second is 78.5&deg;E with a reserve price of 366.4 million; the third involves 119.5&deg;E and 120&deg;E with a reserve price of 393 million; and the last is for 126&deg;E and 142&deg;E with a reserve price of 364.6 million.</p>
			<p>The auction marks the transition of the country's satellite business from a concession model to a licensing regime.</p>
			<p>On July 7, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission board decided to postpone the auction to Aug 28 from July 24 after TC Space Connect was the only firm that participated in the bidding.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://news.satnews.com/2021/08/12/new-vietnamese-satellite-heading-to-japan-for-launch-by-jaxa/<br>
			</p>
			<p>A new, locally-made, smallsat developed by the Vietnam National Space Centre (VNSC) has been completed and sent to Japan for launch into orbit.</p>
			<p>On August 11, the VNSC announced that their NanoDragon satellite was transported from Noi Bai Airport in Hanoi to Narita Airport in Tokyo that day, before being transferred to the Uchinoura Space Centre launch site in Kagoshima Prefecture and handed over to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) for launch preparations.<br>
				Scientists at the Vietnam National Space Center with their NanoDragon smallsat before shipping it to Japan for launch.</p>
			<p>The 3U cubesat NanoDragon weighs approximately 4 kg and is comprised of multiple 10&times;10&times;34 cm (3U) modules. The entire process of researching, designing, integrating and testing the satellite&rsquo;s functions was carried out in Vietnam.</p>
			<p>The smallsat was developed by the VNSC (under the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology) as the result of the nano-class satellite development, launch and trial operation project, under the National Science and Technology Programme on space technology, from 2016 to 2020.</p>
			<p>NanoDragon is tasked with using smallsat beam technology to receive automatic identification signals of ships for the purpose of tracking and monitoring vehicles at sea. In addition, the satellite has also been designed to verify the quality of the satellite posture and control system and a newly-developed, advanced, on-board computer designed specifically for small satellites. NanoDragon will be working from SSO at 560 km above the Earth&rsquo;s surface.</p>
			<p>In parallel with the satellite development, a ground station to operate the satellite after launch has been developed and installed at the VNSC at Hoa Lac Hi-Tech Park in Hanoi.</p>
			<p>Prior to NanoDragon, the first made-in-Vietnam satellite, PicoDragon (weighing 1 kg), was successfully launched with signals received in 2013. MicroDragon (50 kg), developed by a group of 36 young VNSC researchers under Japanese experts&rsquo; supervision, was also sent into orbit on January 18, 2019 and has successfully sent pictures from space to its ground station in Japan.<br>

			<p><b><i>MultiChoice taps GeoGuard to block streaming piracy<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/08/12/multichoice-taps-geoguard-to-block-streaming-piracy/<br>
			</p>
			<p>South African pay TV operator MultiChoice has tapped geolocation and cybersecurity specialist GeoGuard for its VPN and proxy detection solution to combat content piracy.</p>
			<p>MultiChoice is using GeoGuard to block pirate viewers on its streaming services and to eliminate the creation of suspicious user accounts, which according to GeoGuard enables it to free up infrastructure capacity and cut CDN costs.</p>
			<p>GeoGuard is protecting MultiChoice&rsquo;s DStv App, which streams live and catch-up content in countries across sub-Saharan Africa. MultiChoice went live with GeoGuard in February 2021 through the Amazon Marketplace, using the capability provided through GeoGuard&rsquo;s integration with Amazon CloudFront.</p>
			<p>According to GeoGuard, MultiChoice chose it for its ability to better protect its revenues without impacting legitimate users, for GeoGuard&rsquo;s regular database updates, to reduce both false negatives and false positives, and its support for SmartDNS, a technology designed to circumvent geo-restricted services.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;As for all OTT broadcasters, geo-piracy is a major concern, and it was a real coup when we deployed GeoGuard and quickly achieved a great return on investment/ We have been impressed by GeoGuard &#150; it works seamlessly in the background to safeguard our content for legitimate users, ensures territorial exclusivity and helps us comply with our content distribution obligations with rights owners. From an OTT broadcaster perspective, the cost savings and efficiency it&rsquo;s providing in our streaming infrastructure is a huge bonus,&rdquo; said Greg van Wyngaard, Senior Engineer at MultiChoice&rsquo;s Connected Video division.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;While many OTT operators know that pirates weigh down their infrastructure &#150; and cost them money to boot &#150; it is hard to calculate the full impact until the pirates are blocked. With GeoGuard, MultiChoice has cut geo-piracy and account sharing dramatically and realised impressive savings on infrastructure costs. Plus, it can now support more than double the number of concurrent users for live-streamed events, resulting in a better quality of experience for its paying subscribers,&rdquo; said James Clark, Director of Global Sales, GeoComply.<br>

			<p><b><i>Illegal streamers targeted in UK-wide initiative <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/08/12/illegal-streamers-targeted-in-uk-wide-initiative/<br>
			</p>
			<p>In the past week, investigators from UK intellectual property protection organisation FACT and police officers from Eastern Region Special Operations Unit (ERSOU), West Yorkshire Police and Dyfed-Powys Police have visited addresses across the UK to serve Cease and Desist notices to individuals suspected of supplying illegal streaming services.</p>
			<p>The initiative is aimed at preventing the illegal supply of IPTV streams, with investigators visiting homes in Essex, Hertfordshire, West Yorkshire and Pembrokeshire to serve notices informing suspects to cease any illegal activity with immediate effect.</p>
			<p>FACT works with the Government Agency Intelligence Network (GAIN) to gather intelligence on and disrupt organised crime groups (OCGs) associated with this illegal activity. This latest action targeted suspects who were promoting unauthorised access to premium television content, which affects broadcasters and rights owners in the UK and worldwide, causing financial harm to the industry and the economy. Whilst all the individuals visited were operating at a relatively low level, the initiative was aimed at preventing them from undertaking further criminal activity and deterring others from getting involved.</p>
			<p>The effective partnership between law enforcement agencies, rights holders and the private sector allowed for this co-ordinated action, with more actions of a similar nature planned to take place. FACT will continue to monitor any ongoing offending and will take further action against persistent offenders.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We employ a range of tactics to prevent the provision of illegal streaming&rdquo; advises Kieron Sharp, Chief Executive of FACT. &ldquo;Our continuous activity targets different elements of the global piracy landscape, with consideration given to the scale of the offending to ensure effective and proportionate action is taken.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;By taking these measures we are sending a clear message. Piracy is fraud and anyone motivated by financial gain from doing this needs to know that this is a crime which will be taken seriously by Police.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I would like to thank the GAIN and all the Police units for their assistance in this initiative and look forward to further collaboration,&rdquo; he concludes.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This initiative looks to not only cease illegal activity with immediate effect, but also to prevent further crimes taking place,&rdquo; advises Paul Sanders, GAIN coordinator at ERSOU. &ldquo;GAIN is committed to ensuring that Government agencies and other partners work alongside the police to protect our communities from a wide range of criminality, and this activity is an example of our teams working collaboratively to disrupt and dismantle those involved in illicit activities.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to remember that the public may be risking their personal and financial information by engaging with illegal services, and we will continue to support FACT in their endeavours to prevent illegal content provision.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;People may not think they are causing harm by selling streaming services for a quick penny but if you choose to do so, you are breaking the law and there will be consequences when you are caught.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It was good to support FACT in West Yorkshire and we hope this collaboration will send out a clear message to those who think they can get away with it. We will find you,&rdquo; he warns.</p>
			<p>This initiative is the latest in a series of actions to crackdown on illegal streaming and those profiting from it.</p>
			<p>In July 2021, a man was arrested in connection with suspected illegal streaming of premium television channels and other copyrighted material, following a West Mercia Police investigation in partnership with FACT.</p>
			<p>This followed the sentencing of a man to 16 months&rsquo; imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to multiple copyright and fraud offences. The judge recognised that his use of the unauthorised service was a distinct crime in itself, which was reflected in him receiving a separate sentence of four months&rsquo; imprisonment for using the service.</p>
			<p>In April 2021, a serving Corporal in the Royal Air Force (RAF) who sold illegal services which provided access to premium sport, TV and films was sentenced to ten months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months. He was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and loss of service property and also received a reduction to his rank.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab has signed a deal with in-space manufacturing company Varda Space Industries to produce three Photon spacecraft that will integrate with the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;space factories.&rdquo;  </p>
			<p>Varda Space is working to commercialize space manufacturing to build fiber optic cables, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors, which the company says have higher performance when produced in zero-gravity. Varda Space closed a $42 million Series A funding round in July. </p>
			<p>In the mission, Rocket Lab&rsquo;s Photon will support Varda&rsquo;s 120 kg manufacturing and re-entry modules with power, data, and attitude control. When the mission is complete, Photon will perform multiple burns to place Varda&rsquo;s re-entry capsule on a return trajectory to Earth. The first Varda Photon is planned for delivery in the first quarter of 2023, with the second to follow up later in the year and a third in 2024. The contract includes an option for Varda to procure a fourth Photon. Each mission has a three-month duration from launch to landing.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The Varda team is undertaking ground-breaking work that really opens up new possibilities and markets for in-space manufacturing and we couldn&rsquo;t be more excited to make their mission possible with Photon,&rdquo; said Rocket Lab Founder and CEO Peter Beck.<br>

			<p><b><i>Indian rocket suffers catastrophic failure during launch, Earth-watching satellite lost<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.space.com/india-rocket-launch-fails-eos-03-satellite-lost<br>
			</p>
			<p>It was India's first launch of 2021.</p>
			<p>India's first launch of 2021 has ended in failure.</p>
			<p>An Indian rocket carrying a new Earth-observation satellite for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) suffered a catastrophic failure shortly after launching early Thursday (Aug. 12) from the country's Satish Dhawan Space Centre on Sriharikota Island in eastern India. The liftoff occurred at 5:43 a.m. local time in India (8:13 p.m. EDT Aug 11/0013 GMT).</p>
			<p>The launch failure, the first for India since 2017, occurred sometime past the six-minute mark after the mission's rocket, the 12-story-tall Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle, had ignited its cryogenic third stage.</p>
			<p>The launch &quot;could not be fully accomplished&quot; because of a &quot;technical anomaly observed in the cryogenic stage, ISRO chair K. Sivan said in a brief televised statement after the failed mission. </p>
			<p>Lost with the GSLV rocket was the EOS-03 Earth observation satellite designed to be a &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; tool for ISRO to study our planet. The satellite was expected to last at least 10 years working to provide near real-time images of India, track natural disasters and other short-term events and collect data to assist agriculture and forestry by monitoring crop health, according to an ISRO mission description.</p>
			<p>The GSLV launch failure breaks a streak of 14 successful launches for ISRO, the launch tracking site Spaceflight Now reported. It began after the the 2017 failure of a different Indian rocket, a smaller Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, carrying a satellite for the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System. That 2017 failure was the first in 20 years for India's PSLV, according to SpaceNews.</p>
			<p>The last year has been a trying one for India's space program. </p>
			<p>After the launch of EOS-01 in January 2020, the country's launches were placed on hold during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The resumed late that year with two missions, one each in November and December. That November launch successfully placed the EOS-01 Earth observation satellite into orbit. </p>
			<p>The delays from the pandemic prompted ISRO to move the launch of EOS-03 ahead of the EOS-02 mission, originally targeted to fly in March 2021, according to a report by the Indian Express news site. That mission had been rescheduled for no earlier than September and ISRO had planned to launch at least four more missions by the end of 2021, the report stated. </p>
			<p>All five of those missions will likely be on hold as ISRO investigates the cause of the GSLV launch failure. <br>

			<p><b><i>Measat gives up on drifting satellite in a blow for insurers<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacenews.com/measat-gives-up-on-drifting-satellite-in-a-blow-for-insurers/<br>
			</p>
			<p>TAMPA, Fla. &#151; Satellite insurers are bracing for a $45 million claim from Malaysian operator Measat, which plans to de-orbit Measat-3 after failing to return it to service. </p>
			<p>Measat said Aug. 6 it was unable to rescue the aging satellite despite maintaining continuous telemetry and command control since an anomaly first appeared June 21.</p>
			<p>The operator and Measat-3&rsquo;s manufacturer Boeing are still investigating the incident. </p>
			<p>Space tracking company ExoAnalytic Solutions said the issue caused the spacecraft to drift westward out of its 91.5 East orbital slot in geostationary orbit.</p>
			<p>Launched on a Russian Proton rocket in December 2006, Measat-3 was nearing the end of its 15-year design life.</p>
			<p>The key limiting factor in the life of a satellite with chemical propulsion is the amount of fuel onboard, needed for the frequent maneuvers it must make to stay in its orbital slot.</p>
			<p>GEO satellites routinely have enough fuel to outlive their initial design life projections.</p>
			<p>However, insurance sources said Measat-3 ran out of fuel earlier than Measat expected.</p>
			<p>One underwriter said the operator &ldquo;thought they&rsquo;d get another two years out of it,&rdquo; adding that there is sufficient fuel left to send the spacecraft to graveyard orbit, but not enough to continue its broadcast and telecoms services.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We assume they are going to file an insurance claim, we don&rsquo;t know for sure, and the claim would be based on the fact that they thought they had more fuel than they did,&rdquo; the person added.</p>
			<p>Measat confirmed Measat-3 was insured but declined to comment on its insurance policy.</p>
			<p>The Malaysian company presumably would have had to present a health report on Measat-3 to insurers, including how much fuel it has, before renewing its in-orbit insurance for another year. </p>
			<p>Insurance market under strain</p>
			<p>An insurance claim from Measat rumored to be around $45 million would push insurers deeper into the red.</p>
			<p>The insurance sources contacted by SpaceNews put the size of claims so far this year at around $312 million, including Measat&rsquo;s potential claim, versus a total market premium of about $238 million to date.</p>
			<p>A claim following issues on the Maxar Technologies-built SXM-7 satellite, insured for $225 million, is the other big loss for insurers so far in 2021.</p>
			<p>The space insurance market is on course to generate about $500 million in total premium this year, putting it at risk of another annual loss if there are additional in-orbit satellite or launch failures.</p>
			<p>Space insurers paid out around $431 million in claims in 2020, according to data from insurance company AXA XL. </p>
			<p>Although the total market premium came in at about $452 million, the industry considers 2020 a loss-making year after salaries and other expenses.</p>
			<p>It followed significant losses for the space insurance market in 2019 and 2018. </p>
			<p>Equipped with C-band and Ku-band transponders, Measat-3 covered more than 100 countries across Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p>
			<p>Measat said it migrated customers to other satellites in its fleet following the anomaly. </p>
			<p>The company said Aug. 6 it is finalizing a launch date for a replacement satellite called Measat-3d, built by Airbus Defence and Space, &ldquo;for early 2022.&rdquo;<br>

			<p>Investment brings to $2.7bn the total raised since UK-backed company escaped bankruptcy</p>
			<p>OneWeb aims to deploy a constellation of 648 satellites in low Earth orbit to deliver broadband services around the globe &copy; via Reuters</p>
			<p>South Korea&rsquo;s Hanwha, one of the country&rsquo;s biggest conglomerates, has become the latest private investor in OneWeb, the UK-backed satellite internet pioneer, taking an 8.8 per cent stake for $300m.</p>
			<p>The investment brings to $2.7bn the total raised since OneWeb was rescued from bankruptcy last year by the UK government and India&rsquo;s Bharti Global with a joint $1bn bid.</p>
			<p>OneWeb aims to deploy a constellation of 648 satellites in low Earth orbit to deliver broadband services around the globe. Along with Elon Musk&rsquo;s Starlink, it is at the forefront of a rapidly emerging market for internet and other services from cheaper, lower-flying satellites.</p>
			<p>Hanwha&rsquo;s investment suggests a valuation of about $3.4bn for OneWeb and represents a substantial premium to the most recent funding rounds, according to people close to the company.</p>
			<p>In total, Bharti is investing $1bn for a roughly 35 per cent stake after the Hanwha injection. The UK government, which invested $500m in the bailout, will hold just under 20 per cent, as will Eutelsat, the French satellite operator, which earlier this year invested $550m.</p>
			<p>People close to OneWeb said Hanwha&rsquo;s investment would lay the foundations for financing a second generation of satellites with more advanced communications and positioning capabilities than those currently being launched.</p>
			<p>Hanwha is making the investment via Hanwha Systems, the defence systems division that last year acquired Phasor Solutions, a British satellite antenna start-up. The group will have a seat on OneWeb&rsquo;s board.</p>
			<p>OneWeb said the addition of one of South Korea&rsquo;s leading defence groups as a shareholder would bring relationships with new government customers and an expanded geographical reach.</p>
			<p>Neil Masterson, OneWeb chief executive, said Hanwha would also bring &ldquo;advanced defence and antenna technology&rdquo; to the group.</p>
			<p>For Hanwha, the investment helps to boost its ambitions to tap into a commercial space market estimated by Morgan Stanley to expand from roughly $350bn in 2016 to as much as $1tn by 2040.</p>
			<p>Dream of united space will prove elusive</p>
			<p>&ldquo;To OneWeb&rsquo;s vision of connecting all the people across the globe, Hanwha Systems&rsquo; satellite and antenna technology will bring more advantages,&rdquo; said Youn-Chul Kim, president of Hanwha Systems.</p>
			<p>The UK government, which is under pressure to show results from its unusual decision to rescue a bankrupt company, welcomed the investment.</p>
			<p>Hanwha&rsquo;s injection was &ldquo;the latest in a series of votes of confidence in the company from the market&rdquo;, said Kwasi Kwarteng, UK business secretary. &ldquo;The government&rsquo;s equity stake in OneWeb not only allows the UK to capitalise on our first-mover advantage to deploy low Earth orbit technology but will put our country at the forefront of the small-satellite market, which is set to rapidly expand over the years ahead.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Sunil Bharti Mittal, chair of Bharti Enterprises and of OneWeb, described Hanwha as a &ldquo;powerful partner&rdquo; for the satellite group.</p>
			<p>Hanwha&rsquo;s investment is due to be completed in the first half of 2022, subject to regulatory approvals.</p>
			<p>OneWeb, which has 254 satellites in orbit, is aiming to launch a limited commercial service in northern regions later this year and a global offering by the end of 2022.<br>

			<p><b><i>High-Accuracy 3D Laser Scanning Service For Teleport Antennas<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://news.satnews.com/2021/08/11/high-accuracy-3d-laser-scanning-service-for-teleport-antennas/?mohide=true&amp;mc_cid=abd6a6c864&amp;mc_eid=e80892f101<br>
			</p>
			<p>Hiltron Communications, a globally active satellite system integrator, manufacturer and distributor, is introducing a service allowing 3D laser scanning and evaluation of teleport antennas. Based on technology developed by Hiltron&rsquo;s subsidiary partner, ESA Microwave GmbH, this new resource allows reflectors of practically any size to be measured quickly and accurately.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Satellite teleports have massively expanded in number since the mid 1980s,&rdquo; says Hiltron sales manager Jean-Luc George van Eeckhoutte. &ldquo;Many reflectors currently in use date back to those early years and are now performing with reduced efficiency. This new service allows reflectors to be checked in very high resolution as part of a complete performance evaluation. The 3D laser scanning technique we use is far more accurate than the commonly used photogrammetry technique and can be performed while the antenna is actually in operation. It is also much more efficient than photogrammetry which requires manual attachment of measurement targets to the reflector, a time-consuming process and one which results in only a few hundred points being measured.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>Hiltron&rsquo;s 3D laser scanning service allows a million surface reference points per second to be captured with a geometric accuracy of less than 1 mm. The resultant information is integrated into a cloud of approximately 60 million points which is then used to create a computer-aided design model.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>After digitization and computation of the reflector and sub-reflector topography, the ingested data are used to calculate alignment, registration and any required fine-tuning such as surface restoration. Measured specifications and related performance parameters are delivered to the antenna operator or owner together with recommendations clarifying whether the antenna would benefit from upgrading, conversion or fitting with a multi-band feed system.</p>
			<p>The 3D laser scanning service is available to new and existing Hiltron customers for any brand and model of satellite antenna up to 35 metres in diameter.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/malaysias-measat-to-de-orbit-measat-3-satellite-after-anomaly/</p>
			<p>Boeing-made satellite was due to be replaced with Airbus machine next year<br>
			</p>
			<p>Malaysian communications satellite operator Measat is retiring and de-orbiting one of its communication &amp; broadcast satellites after an anomaly first detected in June couldn&rsquo;t be fully rectified.</p>
			<p>The Boeing-made MEASAT-3 Geostationary satellite will be retired and a replacement will be launched next year. Services will be moved to other satellites in the region operated by both Measat and other companies.</p>
			<p>Measat first detected an anomaly on 21 June that caused the satellite to drift out of position, and announced the problem was resolved and the satellite was back under control on June 24. The company shortly followed up saying &ldquo;intermittent service degradation&rdquo; meant further satellite and signal stabilization processes were required.</p>
			<p>In July the company said that while it had maintained continuous telemetry and command control of the satellite, its transponders had been deactivated to prevent interference with other satellites while it worked with Boeing to investigate the issue. At the time &ldquo;almost all&rdquo; customer services on MEASAT-3 had been restored onto backup satellite capacity on other MEASAT satellites [1, 2, 3a, and 3b] and third-party satellites serving the region.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The incident resulted in a complete outage of service and is still under investigation,&rdquo; the company said in a statement. &ldquo;Despite maintaining continuous telemetry and command control of MEASAT-3, further testing and recovery efforts found that the satellite could not re-enter service.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>MEASAT-3, a Boeing 601 satellite, had provided satellite communication services for almost 15 years since its launch in December 2006. MEASAT-3 operated alongside the now-decommissioned Hughes/Boeing-built MEASAT-1 and MEASAT-2 spacecraft in the Malaysia-East Asia Satellite (MEASAT) system.</p>
			<p>MEASAT-3a was built by Orbital Sciences Corporation in 2009.</p>
			<p>Airbus was commissioned in 2019 to develop the original MEASAT-3's replacement satellite, MEASAT-3d, which is due to launch in early 2022. The defense firm also built MEASAT-3b.</p>
			<p>There is no official MEASAT-3c, with the company instead leasing capacity from NewSat's Jabiru 1 satellite under that designation.<br>

				From https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-gisat-1-earth-observation-satellite-launch-tomorrow-countdown-begins-101628643690263.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>The GISAT-1 satellite, once in orbit around the Earth, is expected to essentially be India's &quot;eye in the sky&quot;, monitoring locations of interest. It will also help India monitor and respond to natural disasters and any other short-term events at an alarming pace, Isro officials indicated.</p>
			<p>Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) informed early on Wednesday morning that countdown has begun for the launch of the GSLV-F10 EOS-03 mission. The geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV) is scheduled to launch the Earth observation satellite (EOS) - GISAT-1 at 5:43am tomorrow (i.e. on Thursday, August 12) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) at Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh. The launch, which the country is eagerly looking forward to ahead of Independence Day, is, however, subject to weather conditions, the national space agency has warned.</p>
			<p>Also Read | Isro to launch GISAT-1 in less than 24 hours, a game-changer for India: 10 points</p>
			<p>&quot;Countdown for the launch of GSLV-F10/EOS-03 mission commenced today at 0343Hrs (IST) from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota,&quot; tweeted Isro from its official handle on the microblogging website. The post included a photo of the GSLV-F10 mission, with the rocket decked at the Sriharikota spaceport waiting for its lift-off tomorrow. Hours later, the space agency informed that the filling of oxidiser for the second stage (GS2) of GSLV-F10 has been completed, while the filling of propellant for the aforementioned second stage has commenced.<br>

			<p><b><i>SpaceX to buy Swarm Tech. <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/08/10/spacex-to-buy-swarm-tech/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Swarm Technologies makes tiny cube-satellites. SpaceX has filed a request with the FCC to transfer all of Swarm satellite licences to SpaceX.</p>
			<p>The FCC application states that Swarm is being sold to SpaceX.  Swarm is focused on providing connectivity for Internet of Things products and applications.</p>
			<p>Swarm has some 150 of its cube-satellites into orbit.</p>
			<p>The full FCC notification says: &ldquo;Swarm Technologies, Inc. (&ldquo;Swarm&rdquo; or &ldquo;Transferor&rdquo;) and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (&ldquo;SpaceX&rdquo; or &ldquo;Transferee&rdquo;) (together, the &ldquo;Applicants&rdquo;) hereby request Federal Communications Commission (&ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) consent to transfer to SpaceX control of the earth and space station licenses held by Swarm, a US-licensed satellite operator in the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service (&ldquo;NVNG MSS&rdquo;) authorized to operate in the 137&#150;138 MHz and 148&#150;150.05 MHz bands (the &ldquo;NVNG VHF Bands&rdquo;). Swarm and SpaceX have executed a merger agreement pursuant to which, as described more fully in Section I.C below, Swarm will become a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of SpaceX (the &ldquo;Proposed Transaction&rdquo;).&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The FCC notice adds: &ldquo;On July 16, 2021, SpaceX, Swarm, Swarm Holdco, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of SpaceX (&ldquo;Merger Sub&rdquo;), and Dr. Sara Spangelo, solely in her capacity as Stockholder Representative, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (&ldquo;Merger Agreement&rdquo;). The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Swarm (the &ldquo;Merger&rdquo;), with Swarm surviving the Merger as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of SpaceX upon consummation of the Proposed Transaction.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>SpaceX says: &ldquo;The Proposed Transaction will serve the public interest by strengthening the combined companies&rsquo; ability to provide innovative satellite services that reach unserved and underserved parts of the world. Swarm&rsquo;s services will benefit from the better capitalization and access to resources available to SpaceX, as well as the synergies associated with acquisition by a provider of satellite design, manufacture, and launch services. SpaceX will similarly benefit from access to the intellectual property and expertise developed by the Swarm team, as well as from adding this resourceful and effective team to SpaceX. In all, the Proposed Transaction will benefit the public interest by providing both companies with valuable resources to support success in the rapidly growing satellite industry.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Prime Video comes to Foxtel<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/08/06/prime-video-comes-to-foxtel/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Foxtel Group has announced a distribution deal with Amazon to integrate Prime Video into its set-top boxes by the end of 2021.</p>
			<p>Customers of the Australian pay TV operator will be able to access the SVOD via the iQ3 and iQ4 STBs, along with the soon to launch iQ5.</p>
			<p>The Amazon Prime Video app joins an array of video apps available on Foxtel STBs, including Netflix, ABC iview, SBS on Demand and YouTube.</p>

			<p><b><i>$8.99 A Month Paramount + Takes On Foxtel, Stan &amp; Netflix<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.channelnews.com.au/8-99-a-month-paramount-takes-on-foxtel-stan-netflix/<br>
			</p>
			<p>This week is set to be a big week for the streaming industry in Australia with CBS Viacom set to officially launch their new $8.99 a month Paramount + service up against a surging Foxtel, Stan who lost a lot of Paramount content last year, as well as US archrivals Netflix and Disney.</p>
			<p>In early marketing the Company who own Channel Ten are claiming the new Paramount+ is &ldquo;not just another streaming service&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;a mountain of entertainment&rdquo; and it has to be if the poor performing Channel Ten content is anything to go by.</p>
			<p>Last year Network Ten losing $3.4 million in 2020, according to filings with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and their content has failed to excite consumers with the network constantly performing poorly when it comes to entertainment shows.</p>
			<p>Paramount&rsquo;s library will include movie franchises such as The Godfather, Mission: Impossible, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter, and The Lord of the Rings. For families there is SpongeBob SquarePants, Dora the Explorer, and PAW Patrol, plus new original Koral: SpongeBob&rsquo;s Under Years.</p>
			<p>On launch, Paramount+ will range exclusive premiers including The First Lady (Viola Davis, Gillian Anderson), the rebooted Dexter shows that last year were on Nine Entertainment Stan streaming service.</p>
			<p>In an effort to take on Foxtel in the Sports market ViacomCBS stumped up more $300 million on content including $200M for the rights to A-League and W-League soccer which had failed to attract big audiences to Foxtel who have grown their AFL and NRL coverage during COVID lockdowns.</p>
			<p>That rights deal includes broadcast rights to all Socceroos and Matildas internationals, friendlies, Asian Cup qualifiers and World Cup qualifiers.</p>
			<p>ViacomCBS chief operating and commercial officer and executive vice-president Jarrod Villani, claim that the &ldquo;volume of content and the consistency of that content&rdquo; gives the streaming platform a &ldquo;unique story&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;On launch there&rsquo;ll be 20,000 hours of entertainment immediately available at an incredible value,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>At $8.99 a month the subscription fee is $2.00 more expensive than Amazon Prime Movies at $6.99 and a dollar more expensive than the struggling AppleTV+ at $7.99.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;When you look at that price point, you could quite easily make an argument that there&rsquo;s something around double that price point would be more than fitting to the volume and the quality of the content that exists,&rdquo; Mr Villani said.</p>
			<p>Mr Villani said the live sport content will be delivered to Paramount+ users with a &ldquo;very light ad load&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We think it&rsquo;ll be relatively non-intrusive. We&rsquo;re very considered in the way that we&rsquo;re looking at the advertising. As I say, only seen from a live sport stream perspective &#150; all other content will be, as you expect, ad-free,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>On how the media company can continue to invest in live sport in Australia, in a very competitive market, while balancing the need to return to profit, Mr Villani said the media company considers its &ldquo;investment and support in the same way that we can now invest in any other form of content&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll continue to consider our investment in sport on a tactical basis moving forward,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>CBSViacom believe that their relationship with movie studio&rsquo;s will give them an edge.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Viewers can be confident that that high-quality content will be available moving forward,&rdquo; Mr Villani said in a subtle swipe at competitors such as Stan who lost the Paramount content deal last year.</p>
			<p>Both HBO and NBCUniversal are also investigating direct-to-consumer streaming offering in Australia though there is speculation that they could cut a deal with Foxtel due to the local market becoming cluttered said one insider.</p>
			<p>The launch of Paramount+ in Australia has already seen some Showtime content disappear from the library of Stan, which has had a deal in place with Showtime since it launched in 2015.</p>
			<p>Ironically Villani was cautious setting Paramount+ any goals on launch but is confident its global content pipeline gives it a strong position in the local market.</p>
			<p>The business has not said how many free subscriptions they will distribute or what deals they have done with TV brands to get their new Paramount + onto Smart TV platforms in Australia.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;If we continue to deliver quality content to people, and they&rsquo;ll make up their mind as to whether or not they need another service, what to drop the service, when ultimately how many subscribers come to our platform,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re focused on ensuring the quality of the content is there, the user interface and the quality continues to improve over time. The market will decide where they want to position Paramount+.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We will control the content, we will focus on visibility and will continue to improve our interface, but ultimately it&rsquo;s up to the rest of the public to decide whether they like it or not.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>MEASAT to retire MEASAT-3<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From press release<br>
			</p>
			<p>MEASAT Global Berhad will retire its MEASAT-3 satellite after an anomaly on 21 June 2021. The incident resulted in a complete outage of service and is still under investigation in partnership with our satellite provider Boeing Satellite Systems (BSS). Despite maintaining continuous telemetry and command control of MEASAT-3, further testing and recovery efforts found that the satellite could not re-enter service. The satellite will be de-orbited in the following weeks.</p>
			<p>MEASAT-3, a Boeing 601 satellite, had provided satellite communication services for almost 15 years since its launch in December 2006. The spacecraft, manufactured by BSS, equipped with C-band and Ku-band transponders that cover over 100 countries across Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p>
			<p>MEASAT is currently finalising the launch date of MEASAT-3d for early 2022, which is expected to restore its unrivalled in-orbit satellite redundancy at the company&rsquo;s key orbital hotslot 91.5&deg;E, providing direct-to-home (DTH), broadcasting and telecommunications services for the region, besides significantly enhancing broadband speed of up to 100Mbps in areas with limited or without any terrestrial connectivity throughout Malaysia. Announcements on the MEASAT-3d launch will be released in due course.<br>

			<p><b><i>NT makes late swoop to bid on satellite slots<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2162231/nt-makes-late-swoop-to-bid-on-satellite-slots<br>
			</p>
			<p>National Telecom (NT) has emerged as a bidder in the auction of four satellite orbital slot packages slated for Aug 28 as it bought a bid envelope in the final hour before the one-month extension concluded Friday afternoon.</p>
			<p>Representatives from NT showed up at the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) to buy a bid envelope at around 4pm, briefly before the deadline of 4.30pm.</p>
			<p>The auction marks the transition of the country's satellite business from a concession model to a licensing regime.</p>
			<p>On July 7, the NBTC board decided to postpone the auction to Aug 28 from July 24 after TC Space Connect, wholly owned by SET-listed satellite service provider Thaicom, was the only company prepared to bid.</p>
			<p>The NBTC allowed interested parties an extra month to buy a bid envelope, from July 8 to Aug 6.</p>
			<p>The move comes as a surprise as Digital Economy and Society (DES) Minister Chaiwut Thanakamanusorn earlier told the Bangkok Post NT was not keen on investing in the satellite business because it is focusing on 5G business on the 700-megahertz range.</p>
			<p>He also indicated NT was not ready for the satellite orbital slot auction and the company's board had not made a decision about participation in the bidding.</p>
			<p>A source in the telecom industry who requested anonymity said the participation of NT in the auction is an intriguing development.</p>
			<p>The move by NT follows Gulf Energy Development Plc acquiring a 23.32% stake in InTouch Holdings through a tender offer that ended on Aug 4, making it the biggest shareholder with a 42.25% stake in InTouch, which is the largest shareholder of Thaicom.</p>
			<p>Singtel Global Investment from Singapore has a 21% stake, the second largest shareholding in InTouch.</p>
			<p>The source said this shareholding change in InTouch would have an impact on Thaicom.</p>
			<p>&quot;Now there is a strong reason to move ahead with the auction,&quot; the source said. &quot;NT's participation means the auction will not have to be postponed again.&quot;</p>
			<p>According to another telecom veteran who requested anonymity, the government views the satellite business as a matter of national security and vigorous efforts to buy a stake in InTouch, whose biggest shareholder was a foreign entity, could explain this.</p>
			<p>Gulf's biggest shareholder Sarath Ratanavadi, the veteran said, is known to have good connections with influential figures in the government.</p>
			<p>Mr Sarath studied engineering at Chulalongkorn University where Deputy Prime Minister Supattanapong Punmeechaow was his senior. Mr Chaiwut, a junior faculty member, also once served as an executive at Gulf.</p>
			<p>There are four satellite orbital slot packages up for auction.</p>
			<p>The first consists of 50.5&deg;East and 51&deg;E slots with a reserve price of 677 million baht; the second is 78.5&deg;E with a reserve price of 366.4 million; the third involves 119.5&deg;E and 120&deg;E with a reserve price of 393 million; and the last is for 126&deg;E and 142&deg;E with a reserve price of 364.6 million.</p>
			<p>NT is required to submit its bid request and place a bank guarantee by Aug 11.</p>
			<p>The list of qualified bidders based on experience and financial capability checks is scheduled for announcement on Aug 24, while an information session and a mock auction are slated for Aug 25.<br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/08/09/oneweb-receives-india-licence/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Would-be broadband constellation operator OneWeb has received a Letter of Intent confirming that its licence to provide services to India is approved.</p>
			<p>The confirmation has come from India&rsquo;s Dept. of Communications and the [Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite, GMPCS] licence will be for 20 years. However, OneWeb has to supply certain compliance declarations as well as a fee structure in order for the licence to be validated. The business has also to be licensed for its satellite bandwidth landing rights by the Dept. of Space, but this is now seen as a formality.</p>
			<p>OneWeb is part-owned by India&rsquo;s Bharti Group, the UK government and with additional investments from SoftBank and Eutelsat.</p>
			<p>OneWeb has previously stated that it will start services for India in May 2022, however it expects to offer connectivity to certain northerly countries later in 2021.</p>
			<p>OneWeb is not targeting consumers directly but will operate a Business-to-Business trading model, working through Bharti as well as other service providers.<br>

				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/08/06/paramount-clearly-working-as-viacomcbs-adds-6-5-million-streaming-subs/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Paramount+ has had its best quarter for subscriber growth since its launch in March, ViacomCBS has said.</p>
			<p>The broadcast giant said that it added 6.5 million new subscribers to Paramount+ along with Showtime to a total of 42 million. AVOD service Pluto TV also performed well, with CEO Bob Bakish calling it &ldquo;the leading free ad supported streaming television service in the market.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>Of Paramount+, Bakish said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear Paramount+ is resonating with consumers both in the US and internationally. And that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s a differentiated product with real competitive advantages. It has something for everyone. And we saw strong subscriber acquisition and engagement across a variety of different joiners.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In short, by putting the full power of ViacomCBS behind Paramount+, we&rsquo;re beginning to see the massive potential this service has&#x2026; While it&rsquo;s early days, Paramount+ is clearly working, which is why we&rsquo;re continuing to invest to deliver on its promise and potential.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Overall, the company&rsquo;s revenue grew by 8% year-over-year to US$6.6 billion for the quarter which ended June 30. This beat analyst estimates of US$6.48 billion, with streaming contributing 15% of total revenue in 2021. </p>
			<p>The company also announced a partnership with Sky to rollout Paramount+ in Europe. The streamer will launch in the UK, Ireland, Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Austria next year as part of a new multi-year distribution agreement that also includes the extended carriage of ViacomCBS&rsquo; portfolio of pay TV channels and the renewal of Sky as an ad sales partner in select markets.<br>

			<p><b><i>New Zealand and LeoLabs sign multiyear deal for Space Regulatory platform<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacenews.com/new-zealand-and-leolabs-sign-multiyear-deal-for-space-regulatory-platform/<br>
			</p>
			<p>LeoLabs has worked with the New Zealand Space Agency to create a Space Regulatory and Sustainability Platform. The cloud-based platform tracks the position and orbit of individual satellites, shows where they&rsquo;re heading, offers historical orbit records, provides reports on changes in a satellite&rsquo;s orbit and activates alerts when a satellite is not complying with its licensing agreement. Credit: LeoLabs</p>
			<p>SAN FRANCISCO &#150; LeoLabs and the New Zealand Space Agency (NZSA) are working together to develop a cloud-based software platform for monitoring space activity. New Zealand&rsquo;s Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment announced the multiyear deal Aug. 5, saying it would lead to &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s most advanced Space Regulatory and Sustainability Platform.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>LeoLabs, a Silicon Valley startup focused on monitoring activity in low Earth orbit, began developing the platform with the NZSA in 2019. In the past two years, LeoLabs and NZSA have moved from a prototype platform that tracks objects in low Earth orbit and ensures satellite operators are fulfilling commitments made when applying for launch licenses to a working model.</p>
			<p>Much of LeoLabs&rsquo; business to date has focused on helping satellite operators identify potential collisions and determine how to safely move out of the path of other satellites and space debris. In this new line of business, LeoLabs is helping a government agency fulfill its commitment under the Outer Space Treaty to exercise control over space activities.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We think it&rsquo;s a template that can be used around the world,&rdquo; LeoLabs CEO Dan Ceperley told SpaceNews. &ldquo;Every single spacefaring nation has a set of assets they are responsible for and an impact on space sustainability. They need to be informed about what risks they face.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Under the Outer Space Treaty, the launching state is required to license satellites and ensure satellite operators comply with licensing rules.</p>
			<p>That does not always happen, though. While nations put significant effort into the licensing process, many do not have the tools to track satellites in orbit or to take action if a satellite diverges from its orbit or fails to de-orbit in the agreed-upon timeframe.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Our partnership with LeoLabs has allowed us to better understand what&rsquo;s in space, which is key to upholding our duties as a launching country and ensuring the responsible use of the space environment,&rdquo; Peter Crabtree, general manager for science, innovation and international in New Zealand&rsquo;s Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, said in a statement.</p>
			<p>New Zealand has quickly become an important launch state. The country established NZSA in 2016. Two years later, California-based Rocket Lab began conducting commercial launches from a private spaceport on New Zealand&rsquo;s Mahia Peninsula. The company has completed 17 commercial orbital launches to date, including the July 29 launch of a U.S. Space Force satellite.</p>
			<p>LeoLabs first revealed ties with New Zealand in 2018 when it announced plans to build the Kiwi Space Radar.  That S-band radar began tracking objects in low Earth orbit as small as 2 centimeters in diameter in 2019.</p>
			<p>The New Zealand Space Agency has stepped to the forefront on space sustainability,&rdquo; Ceperley said. &ldquo;New Zealand is the gateway to space for a lot of innovative companies and they&rsquo;ve always had an environmental-sustainability thread to their national ethos.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The Space Regulatory and Sustainability Platform draws information from LeoLabs&rsquo; network of four phased-array radars to show the location of objects in orbit and highlight potential problems. Following a pilot phase, NZSA has embedded the platform into its space operations to track the position and orbit of individual satellites, view historical orbit records, obtain reports on changes in satellite orbits and receive alerts when a satellite is not complying with its licensing agreement.</p>
			<p>Most of the time satellites remain in their intended orbit and the platform provides confirmation, Ceperley said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;When there&rsquo;s some early indication that a satellite is in a different orbit than expected, you have a lot of time to react,&rdquo; Cepereley said. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t have to be an emergency. It can be a discussion. You want the heads up as soon as possible so you can react, whether you&rsquo;re the company or the regulator.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Record Australian sub numbers: News brands 800k, Kayo 1.079m, Binge 827k<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.mediaweek.com.au/news-corp-results-record-news-customers-foxtel-streaming-subs-pass-2m/<br>
			</p>
			<p>News Corporation has reported financial results for the three months and fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. Commenting on the results, the media company&lsquo;s chief executive Robert Thomson told an analysts call this morning about record news subscriptions, record traffic at the news and real estate business and record subscriber numbers at Foxtel.</p>
			<p>Thomson said: &ldquo;Fiscal year 2021 was the most profitable year since we created the new News Corp in 2013, with revenues rising 4 percent in the full year and surging by 30 percent in the fourth quarter. Profitability improved by 26 percent for the year, when we had a record number of digital subscriptions, record revenue and profits at Move and record traffic at realtor.com, record profits at HarperCollins and the largest profit at Dow Jones since its acquisition in 2007.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We also saw record subscriber growth at Foxtel, where, at the end of June, our paid streaming subscribers reached over 2 million, an increase year-on-year of 155 percent. That sterling performance has clearly given us much optionality as we consider Foxtel&rsquo;s future, which is certainly bright, given that revenues rose 33 percent in the fourth quarter.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Our strong record of cash generation, with a positive balance of $2.2 billion at the end of June, has given us enhanced flexibility. We were opportunistically able to take advantage of the required sale of OPIS, which we believe will be transformative for the already successful Dow Jones Professional Information Business. Our robust cash position has prompted the company to actively review our capital allocation policy, with a greater focus on buybacks.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The intrinsic value of our content has been amplified through landmark news payment agreements with major tech platforms. These deals, which are confidential, will add revenue annually into nine figures and are a profoundly positive sign of the ongoing transformation of the news landscape.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I want to express my sincere gratitude to the employees of News Corp, who have navigated these trying times with professionalism and with principle. Their efforts, their creativity and their commitment have built on the company&rsquo;s proud foundations and been a catalyst for these particularly impressive results.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Regarding the revenue from deals with Facebook and Google, Susan Panuccio, News Corp chief financial officer, indicated the impact will be felt in the new financial year when the company might share some detail regarding the benefit.</p>
			<p>Full-year results</p>
			<p>News Corp reported fiscal 2021 full-year total revenues of $9.36 billion, a 4% increase compared to $9.01 billion in the prior year, reflecting a $513 million, or 6%, positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The increase was also driven by growth at the Digital Real Estate Services, Book Publishing and Dow Jones segments and higher streaming revenues at the Subscription Video Services segment.</p>
			<p>The growth was partially offset by lower revenues at the News Media segment, which was primarily due to the divestiture of News America Marketing in May 2020. Adjusted Revenues (which exclude the foreign currency impact, acquisitions and divestitures as defined in Note 2) increased 5%.</p>
			<p>Full-year revenues increased $188 million, or 10%, compared with the prior year, reflecting a $217 million, or 12%, positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations and $89 million of higher revenues from Foxtel&rsquo;s streaming products. The revenue increase was partially offset by the impact from fewer residential broadcast subscribers.</p>
			<p>Lower expenses related to entertainment programming, transmission and employee costs were offset by increased investment in streaming products and $35 million of higher sports programming rights and production costs.</p>
			<p>As of June 30, 2021, Foxtel&rsquo;s total closing paid subscribers were 3.891 million, a 40% increase compared to the prior year, primarily due to growth in Binge and Kayo subscribers and higher commercial subscribers, partially offset by lower residential broadcast subscribers. 1.885 million of the total closing paid subscribers were residential and commercial broadcast subscribers, and the remaining 2.006 million consisted of Kayo, Binge and Foxtel Now subscribers.</p>
			<p>As of June 30, 2021, there were 1.079 million Kayo subscribers (1.054 million paying), compared to 465,000 subscribers (419,000 paying) in the prior year.</p>
			<p>Binge, which launched in May 2020, had 827,000 subscribers (733,000 paying) as of June 30, 2021, compared to 80,000 subscribers (56,000 paying) in the prior year. As of June 30, 2021, there were 228,000 Foxtel Now subscribers (219,000 paying), compared to 336,000 subscribers (313,000 paying) in the prior year.</p>
			<p>Broadcast subscriber churn in the quarter was 17.1% compared to 13.2% in the prior year, due to fewer promotions, the roll-off of lower value subscribers, as well as the lapping of various measures implemented due to Covid-19 in the prior year. Broadcast ARPU for the quarter increased 4% to A$81 (US$63).</p>
			<p>Robert Thomson noted the good work done by executive chairman Siobhan McKenna and CEO Patrick Delany at Foxtel. He added the improved financial position gives the business many more options across decisions relating to content acquisition and pricing. The Foxtel business is also looking forward to the introduction of the new iQ5 box in the new financial year.<br>

			<p><b><i>How Bangladesh became the tour nobody wanted to air<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://amp.theage.com.au/sport/cricket/how-bangladesh-became-the-tour-nobody-wanted-to-air-20210806-p58glo.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>It was only after they walked off the field at the end of the first game in Dhaka that Australia&rsquo;s cricketers found out that their series against Bangladesh had become the first in nearly 30 years not to find a legal way of being seen on screens back home.</p>
			<p>Upon retrieving their phones, they were informed through the messages of surprise and curiosity from partners, family members and friends. Many had reflexively switched on their Foxtel or Kayo service to find that the only cricket they could glimpse was a game from The Hundred competition in England.<br>
				Family and friends of Ashton Agar can&rsquo;t watch him in action back home.</p>
			<p>Family and friends of Ashton Agar can&rsquo;t watch him in action back home. AP</p>
			<p>How, then, did a series involving the national team come to be totally blacked out in Australia? This was hard enough to imagine back in 1994, when the tour of Pakistan took place just too soon for the nascent pay TV market to pick it up. In 2021, amid greater choice for broadcast and streaming options than at any time in history, it seemed an impossibility.</p>
			<p>Headline reasons have included a clash with the Tokyo Olympics, and the absence of Glenn Maxwell, Pat Cummins, David Warner and Steve Smith from the touring team. Both are valid, but neither are definitive: plenty of tours have taken place without high profile names, and plenty have also clashed with Olympic games. All have still been broadcast.</p>
			<p>What&rsquo;s changed since Australia&rsquo;s last tour of Bangladesh in late 2017 are the money crunch caused primarily by COVID-19, and also the fact that Foxtel, the traditional broadcaster of Australian tours overseas, now has the rights to every ball bowled in a home season.</p>
			<p>While Fox still has considerable overseas rights - deals to show India&rsquo;s home matches and England&rsquo;s, plus ICC events, with the likelihood that Australia&rsquo;s proposed tour of Pakistan next year will also find a home on the network, marginal series such as the current tour of Bangladesh are less attractive.</p>
			<p>At the same time, none of Nine/Stan Sports, Seven, or Ten have shown interest in re-entering the cricket broadcasting pool for such series. The lack of any competitive tension for overseas cricket beyond the very front rank of series is a concerning development for all cricket boards, and an irritation for Cricket Australia in terms of having the national team&rsquo;s games seen at home.</p>
			<p>BCB sources have told The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald that in May, when the rights holders first approached Foxtel about acquiring rights for the series, the response was a surprise. The network &ldquo;would like to&rdquo; air Australia&rsquo;s matches, but &ldquo;cannot offer&rdquo; a rights delivery or technical fee. In effect, the rights holders would need to stump up the cash for providing the feed to Fox Sports, while also foregoing any rights fee.</p>
			<p>Then on August 1, two days out from the series, the rights agent approached Foxtel again to gauge interest, now the Australian squad had arrived safely in Dhaka. Customarily, these have been the moments when Foxtel has picked up the rights to matches, at the last moment, as was the case with the West Indies tour that preceded Bangladesh.</p>
			<p>Tour blackout: Australia thrashed by Bangladesh in match not broadcast on TV</p>
			<p>This time, however, the position remained unchanged. Foxtel would provide &ldquo;placement&rdquo; of the series on its channels, but without paying a rights or technical fee. Left without any prospect of a return on the rights, the holders elected to keep Australia blacked out, rather than opening up any free options for viewing of the series through Fox Sports, YouTube, or elsewhere.</p>
			<p>When asked to confirm whether they had asked for access to the Bangladesh series free of cost, a Foxtel spokesperson declined to comment. The network had previously offered the following statement: &ldquo;The Foxtel Group does not have the rights to broadcast the Bangladesh T20 series&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>The lack of interest in the market left the injured Aaron Finch and resting Maxwell to make social media appeals for where to watch the game, the touring team to discover the blackout post-game, and Ashton Agar to ruminate on what was being lost back home.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Well my wife&rsquo;s not happy about it because she doesn&rsquo;t get to watch me play,&rdquo; Agar said. &ldquo;Do I think it&rsquo;s lucky the Australian public aren&rsquo;t seeing that? No, I think everyone wants to watch cricket all the time, win or lose people like cricket, and it can be really exciting to watch.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;So for people who really love the game, different conditions create different learning opportunities. I imagine a child or a kid, boy or girl, watching this game growing up, they&rsquo;re seeing players they may never have seen before or bowling styles you&rsquo;re not used to in Australia.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Viewers may have to get used to this week&rsquo;s frustrations. A proposed set of matches prior to the Twenty20 World Cup, arranged by Afghanistan but hosted in Sri Lanka, are also without an Australian rights holder.</p>
			<p>Those games are slated to include three ODIs against Afghanistan and a triangular T20 series involving Afghanistan, Australia and the West Indies. How Australian cricket followers would react to another blackout, this time without an Olympics clash and with a far stronger Australian side turning out ahead of the Cup itself, remains to be seen.<br>

				From https://paxex.aero/china-eastern-live-tv-panasonic-avionics/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Live television in flight is coming to China. Panasonic Avionics will deliver multiple channels of live TV service to China Eastern as the launch customer of its expanded channel selection, adding multiple Chinese broadcasters to its portfolio.</p>
			<p>    China is a strategically important market for Panasonic Avionics, and we are delighted to welcome China Eastern as the first airline in this market to launch our Live Television service. Their passengers can now stay up to date with global news and sporting events in-flight, taking advantage of the additional satellite capacity we have just invested in over China.<br>
				    &#150; Ken Sain, CEO, Panasonic Avionics</p>
			<p>The China Eastern wide-body fleet of Airbus A330, A350 and Boeing B777 and B787 are expected to add the service on board. Initial content includes feeds from CCTV and CGTN.</p>
			<p>The ability to add the new channels comes, in part, thanks to the activation of APSTAR-6D and the increased network capacity it offers over China.</p>
			<p>PAC reported the APSTAR 6D satellite active in February 2021, increasing capacity across the Asia Pacific region. Bringing the China capacity online required additional integration with a local ground station, however.</p>
			<p>With that testing completed and the Beijing teleport online, airlines flying over China can take advantage of the boost in available bandwidth. This now includes the extra TV feeds running on the satellite.<br>

			<p><b><i>China places two KL-Beta satellites into orbit <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/08/kl-beta-launch/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Without previous warning or announcement, China&rsquo;s space agency launched two satellites from Launch Complex 16 at the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center on Wednesday, August 4. The two payloads, called &ldquo;KL-Beta-A&rdquo; and &ldquo;KL-Beta-B,&rdquo; launched on a Chang Zheng 6 rocket into a sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) at 11:01 UTC. </p>
			<p>This marked the 27th launch from China in 2021 and came just hours after the failed launch of a Hyperbola-1 rocket on August 3 and before the planned launch of a Chang Zheng 3 B/E rocket on August 5.</p>
			<p>KL-Beta-A and KL-Beta-B were built by the Shanghai Institute for Microsatellite Innovation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and are operated by the German company KLEO-connect. The Beta satellites will help test new interference suppression technology for Ka-band mobile communications satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) and Geostationary orbit (GEO).</p>
			<p>The first round of KL satellites were &ldquo;KL-Alpha&rdquo;, the first of which launched in November 2019 on a Kuaizhou-1A rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. </p>
			<p>The KL-Beta series are an improved version, though &#151; as with numerous aspects of China&rsquo;s space program &#151; the exact mass as well as the upgrades introduced with them are not known.</p>
			<p>The satellites launched on a Chang Zheng 6 (CZ-6), also known as Long March 6 &#151; a three stage to orbit rocket that is part of the Chang Zheng family. The CZ-6 is designed to deliver lighter mass payloads of up to 1.5 tons into LEO and 1.08 tons into SSO.</p>
			<p>Five of the rocket&rsquo;s seven missions to date have been to sun-synchronous orbit &#151; where the payload passes over the Earth&rsquo;s surface at the same local solar time every day. </p>
			<p>The CZ-6 launches exclusively from LC-16 at Taiyuan and was developed by the China Aerospace and Technology Corporation (CASC), which began work on the rocket in 2009. It launched for the first time on September 19, 2015 and successfully carried 20 satellites into an SSO.</p>
			<p>All of its flights to date have been successful.</p>
			<p>The Chang Zheng 6 stands 29 meters tall with a diameter of 3.35 meters. Its first stage is powered by a single YF-100 rocket engine, which uses RP-1 rocket grade kerosene as its fuel and liquid oxygen (LOX) as an oxidizer. </p>
			<p>The YF-100 runs an oxidizer-rich staged combustion that produces approximately 1,200 kN of thrust at liftoff. </p>
			<p>The second stage of the vehicle is powered by a single YF-115 engine, which uses the same fuel and oxidizer as the first stage. The YF-115 is the same engine used on the CZ-7 and shows the trend of Chinese rockets using the same engine throughout a line of launch vehicles. </p>
			<p>The YF-115 has a specific impulse (isp) of 341.5 seconds and a thrust of approximately 180 kN.</p>
			<p>The third stage employs a single engine capable of producing 6.5 kN of thrust. It is used for plane changes to achieve different orbits for different payloads on the same launch as well as to accurately move a payload into its final, desired deployment orbit. </p>
			<p>This engine runs on hypergolic unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and dinitrogen tetroxide. Further details about this third stage engine are not known.</p>
			<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s launch took place from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center located in Shanxi province in northern China. The majority of launches from this site are meteorological or Earth resource satellites to sun-synchronous orbit as well as ICBM tests.</p>
			<p>Together with the Chang Zheng 5, which is used as a heavy lift launch vehicle, and the Chang Zheng 7 for medium lift capabilities, the CZ-6 is part of the next generation of Chinese launch vehicles.</p>
			<p>The main feature of these newer rockets is a change from highly toxic hypergolic fuels to either hydrogen or RP-1 as fuel for the first and second stages. The CZ-5 and CZ-7 also launch out over the open sea instead of from inland sites where lower stages are sometimes allowed to destructively impact near or in populated areas.<br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/08/04/anuvu-orders-2-tiny-geo-sats/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Anuvu, which is the new name for In-Flight Connectivity business Global Eagle Entertainment, has ordered up two small geostationary satellites as part of a fleet of eight in a new mini-constellation.</p>
			<p>Anuvu will use the satellites, due for launch in 2023, to serve WiFi on aircraft, boats and remote locations in North America and the Caribbean region.</p>
			<p>The satellites will be built by San Francisco-based Astranis. The Astranis mission is to build lower-cost but more powerful satellites. The company claims to be able to build a satellite in 12-18 months, &ldquo;about five-times faster than our competitors&rdquo;. Earlier this year in April Astranis raised $250 million from a group of investors led by BlackRock and Baillie Gifford.</p>
			<p>The order from Anuvu is for micro cube-shaped satellites of some 1 metre in size and weighing under 400 kgs.<br>

			<p><b><i>Telstra opens London broadcast centre<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/08/02/telstra-opens-london-broadcast-centre/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Telstra Broadcast Services (TBS) is expanding on its investments in the dynamic European market with the opening of the new Telstra UK Broadcast Operations Centre (BOC), situated in London&rsquo;s Docklands.</p>
			<p>Located in Telstra&rsquo;s London Hosting Centre, the BOC will host a Master Control Room, office space, and lab/workshop area designed to facilitate tests and builds. The low latency, high proximity BOC has been designed specifically for live video productions and will assist in managing and monitoring content to and from Telstra&rsquo;s EMEA customers 24/7 on the company&rsquo;s global fibre, satellite, internet, and partner networks.</p>
			<p>It is also designed to provide localised monitoring, alerting, routing, and switching of Telstra&rsquo;s services to the broadcast community, including the company&rsquo;s Internet Delivery Network, Global Media Network, and Special Events Network. Moreover, following the MediaCloud acquisition in June, TBS also has the advantage of leveraging the MediaCloud team&rsquo;s considerable experience in managing and monitoring Internet delivery networks.</p>
			<p>The facility and service assurance will be managed by the elite team at Telstra Broadcast Services who are industry experts with decades of combined experience in ensuring the right blend of networks, technology, and services for global broadcasters, rights-holders, and sporting bodies.</p>
			<p>The BOC is designed to provide access to Telstra&rsquo;s network of over 2500 global customer sites, venues, and remote production hubs, as well as connectivity into 19 major global media network providers, many of which are in the UK and Continental Europe. It also provides a secure cloud gateway solution with scalable service assurance for content delivery to off-network media buyers.</p>
			<p>The new facility also provides access to Telstra&rsquo;s Pittsburgh BOC and Hong Kong BOC, which is conveniently located in Telstra&rsquo;s Stanley Teleport, where the company&rsquo;s media experts help ensure streamlined inter-connectivity between satellites, global subsea cable systems, and the terrestrial IP network.</p>
			<p>Together with Telstra&rsquo;s Sydney BOC, the four centres have the capability to allow Telstra Broadcast Services to offer global coverage and 24/7 global service assurance for customers.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Telstra Broadcast Services already manages over 400 satellite, media, and data services, as well as overseeing three million permanent channel hours and 20,000 ad hoc event bookings every year,&rdquo; comments Andreas Eriksson, Head of Telstra Broadcast Services. &ldquo;By increasing our investment in London with this new facility, we are demonstrating our commitment to the European market and providing exactly the sort of low latency high-quality services both in and out of Europe that the industry, and the sports and live events sectors, in particular, are demanding.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Next_batch_of_OneWeb_satellites_set_to_launch_August_20_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>File image of the Soyuz 2.1b carrier rocket shortly after launch.</p>
			<p>Russia will launch the next batch of OneWeb satellites from the Baikonur cosmodrome on August 20, Dmitry Rogozin, the director general of state space corporation Roscosmos, confirmed on Saturday.</p>
			<p>The launch was originally set for August 5, but was postponed due to some of the satellites having faulty parts. Earlier in the month, a space industry source told Sputnik that the launch was rescheduled for August 20-21.</p>
			<p>&quot;Another launch of the Soyuz 2.1b [carrier rocket] with 36 OneWeb satellites is scheduled [to take place] at the Baikonur cosmodrome on August 20,&quot; Rogozin tweeted.</p>
			<p>In June 2015, Roscosmos signed contracts with UK company OneWeb and French firm Arianespace for 21 commercial launches from Baikonur, the Guiana Space Centre, and Vostochny spaceports. In September 2020, OneWeb reduced the number of launches to 19.</p>
			<p>The UK company plans to have 648 satellites orbiting Earth, providing broadband access to the Internet to everyone across the globe.<br>

			<p><b><i>SpaceX says Starlink has about 90,000 users as the internet service gains subscribers<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/08/03/spacex-starlink-satellite-internet-has-about-90000-users.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>SpaceX added subscribers to its Starlink satellite internet service, with Elon Musk's company saying it now serves about 90,000 users around the world.</p>
			<p>The company gave an update on Starlink's growth in a July 29 call with Federal Communications Commission officials, noting that the service now has users in 12 countries. The new user total, which appears to count the number of households with a Starlink dish, marks an addition of about 20,000 users in a month, as Musk said in late June that the company had passed &quot;the strategically notable number of 69,420 active users.&quot;</p>
			<p>Starlink is the company's capital-intensive project to build an interconnected internet network with thousands of satellites, known in the space industry as a constellation, designed to deliver high-speed internet to consumers anywhere on the planet. SpaceX first rolled out the service with a beta program for select consumers for $99 a month, and in the past year has sought regulatory approval to test the network inflight and expand the service to large moving vehicles, like ships and trucks.</p>
			<p>SpaceX also told the FCC that Starlink has &quot;over half a million orders/deposits globally,&quot; with Musk having said in June that the company could add that many users by summer 2022.</p>
			<p>Starlink is the world's largest satellite constellation, with more than 1,700 satellite launched to date.</p>
			<p>Preparing to deploy next-gen satellites</p>
			<p>The company also gave the FCC an overview of the &quot;next-generation satellites&quot; the company plans to begin launching. The new Starlink satellites will feature &quot;faster speeds,&quot; &quot;lower latency,&quot; and &quot;more backhaul capacity&quot; to serve more users, SpaceX said. Latency is the amount of delay in an internet network. It measures how much time it takes for a signal to travel back and forth from a destination.</p>
			<p>SpaceX also emphasized to the FCC its plans to begin launching Starlink satellites with its massive Starship rockets. The company's leadership has previously touted the increased capability Starship would bring. Its Falcon 9 rocket can launch 60 Starlink satellites at a time, but Starship would be able to &quot;take 400 satellites at a time,&quot; SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell said in 2019.</p>
			<p>Starship and Starlink each represent multi-billion dollar projects that are key to SpaceX's growth, driving much of the company's $74 billion valuation.<br>

			<p><b><i>Mystery surrounds Chinese private rocket launch attempt<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacenews.com/mystery-surrounds-chinese-private-rocket-launch-attempt/<br>
			</p>
			<p>HELSINKI &#151; Chinese private firm iSpace conducted a launch of a Hyperbola-1 solid rocket early Tuesday but status of the mission remained unclear for hours after liftoff.</p>
			<p>The Hyperbola-1 four-stage solid rocket lifted off from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert at around 3:50 a.m. Eastern (15:50 local time) August 3. </p>
			<p>The launch was tacitly revealed ahead of time via airspace closure notices. The first signs of an issue with the launch came with the early deletion of amateur footage from Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo. </p>
			<p>A successful launch to a sun-synchronous orbit would normally be reported within an hour of launch. Neither the firm nor Chinese state media had issued a report on the situation by 8:00 a.m. Eastern. Chinese state media later confirmed that the satellite &ldquo;did not enter orbit as scheduled.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The failure is the second loss in a row for iSpace, which is one of China&rsquo;s first and most financially backed commercial launch companies. Last year the company raised $173 million in series B round funding for new launcher series. However a planned IPO has not materialized. </p>
			<p>The first Hyperbola-1 rocket successfully sent a satellite into orbit in July 2019, making iSpace the first private Chinese launch company to achieve orbit. The second launch, in February this year, ended in failure. Falling foam insulation was quickly isolated as the cause of the loss of the mission. Images of the first and second Hyperbola-1 rockets suggest significant changes in design between the two earlier launches. </p>
			<p>Amid the setback, Beijing-based iSpace is meanwhile also working towards hop tests using a test stage for the reusable Hyperbola-2 methane-liquid oxygen launch vehicle. In April iSpace conducted lengthy variable thrust hot fire tests of its Jiaodian-1 engine.</p>
			<p>The firm late last month also carried out tests on grid fins for the launcher. The 28-meter-tall, 3.35-meter-diameter liquid Hyperbola-2 is designed to be capable of delivering over 1,100 kilograms of payload into a 500-kilometer Sun-synchronous orbit, or 800 kilograms when the first stage is to be recovered and reused. A larger Hyperbola-3 series, including plans for an asymmetrical launcher variant, recently progressed from a from design to model development phase. </p>
			<p>A second failure could have consequences in an uncertain, nascent yet crowded Chinese light solid rocket launch market. Galactic Energy, which became only the second Chinese company to deliver a payload into orbit in November, is currently preparing for two launches of its Ceres-1 solid rocket in the coming months, placing it in a position to demonstrate a measure of reliability.</p>
			<p>To date, four Chinese private companies&#151;excluding Expace, a spinoff from state-owned giant CASIC&#151;have made six attempts to reach orbit with solid rockets. Two launches, from iSpace and Galactic Energy, have been successful. Landspace and Onespace suffered failures in October 2018 and March 2019 respectively.</p>
			<p>Expace has successfully delivered numerous satellites into orbit with its Kuaizhou-1A solid rocket. The Kuaizhou-1A and Kuaizhou-11 had been grounded following failures of both launchers in 2020, but Expace today announced the final assembly of both a Kuaizhou-1A and a Kuaizhou-11 was underway.</p>
			<p>China Rocket, a CASC spinoff, has developed and successfully launched the Jielong-1 solid rocket, but it has not flown since August 2019. The larger Jielong-3 is planned to have its test flight in 2022. Chinese Academy of Sciences spinoff CAS Space said earlier in the year that it aims for a first launch of the ZK-1A solid rocket capable of lifting 1.5 tons to LEO around September. </p>
			<p>Chinese firms are also working on more complex liquid propellant launch vehicles, some of which are also aiming to achieve first stage reusability.</p>
			<p>Landspace, iSpace, Deep Blue Aerospace and Space Pioneer are close to making orbital launch attempts or starting VTVL hop tests for various kerosene or methane fueled rockets and test vehicles. </p>
			<p>Others such as Spacetrek, Galactic Energy, Space Transportation, Rocket Pi and more are also developing liquid launch vehicles. State-owned spinoffs CAS Space and China Rocket are also working towards their own orbital liquid launchers.</p>
			<p>China&rsquo;s central government made a decision to open up launch and other sectors of the space industry to private capital in late 2014. The move is seen as a reaction to developments in the U.S. and the emergence of highly innovative and much more agile companies.<br>

			<p><b><i>Foxtel adds Amazon Prime Video<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.adnews.com.au/news/foxtel-adds-amazon-prime-video<br>
			</p>
			<p>Foxtel will integrate the Amazon Prime Video app into its set-top boxes.</p>
			<p>The partnership accelerates Foxtel&rsquo;s streaming aggregation strategy to bring together TV, live and on-demand in one place.</p>
			<p>All Foxtel customers with a Prime membership and an iQ3, iQ4, or the soon-to-launch iQ5 set top box, will be able to access Prime Video content through their device.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This agreement is a significant milestone in our transformation strategy, bringing another entertainment powerhouse to our Foxtel customers and giving them convenient access to even more world-class entertainment,&rdquo; says Foxtel Group CEO Patrick Delany.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It accelerates our strategy for Foxtel to be an aggregator of the world&rsquo;s best streaming content, adding to the apps we already have on Foxtel set-tops including Netflix, ABC iview, SBS On Demand and YouTube.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The Amazon Prime Video app will be available to Foxtel subscribers by the end of 2021.</p>
			<p>Content on Amazon Prime includes Australian Original series such as Luxe Listings Sydney, Making Their Mark and The Test: A New Era for Australia&rsquo;s Team, as well as the upcoming Back to the Rafters series.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;As a customer obsessed company, we are always looking for new ways to be more accessible to our customers,&rdquo; says head of Amazon Prime Video Australia Hushidar Kharas.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;By distributing with leading subscription television services like Foxtel, Prime Video&rsquo;s content will be even more accessible to entertainment hungry Australians, and give them greater access to watch new releases such as the upcoming Amazon Exclusive series Nine Perfect Strangers and the Australian Amazon Original Series Back to the Rafters.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This launch will also allow more of our customers to access the Prime Video Store and rent or buy their favourite new release and classic movies via the Foxtel set-tops.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Network Ten intends to bid for sporting rights despite $3 million loss</p>
			<p>From https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/business/companies/network-ten-intends-to-bid-for-sporting-rights-despite-3-million-loss-20210801-p58etk.html</p>
			<p>Network Ten is planning to ramp up its investment in sporting rights as it prepares to launch its new subscription streaming service, despite posting a $3 million loss last year and broader concerns about a weak advertising market.</p>
			<p>ViacomCBS and Ten sales boss Rod Prosser said he is confident that a multimillion-dollar investment in football broadcast rights will deliver returns for the network and its streaming service, Paramount+, despite unpredictable market conditions caused by COVID-19 last year, and the ongoing lockdown in NSW.</p>
			<p>His comments were made as Ten revealed a loss for the 2020 calendar year, after accounting for $17 million in restructuring costs, and a write-down on the value of certain programs.<br>
				ViacomCBS is the new home for Sam Kerr and the Matildas for three years after a new $100 million deal was signed.</p>

			<p>ViacomCBS and Ten announced a five-year, $200 million deal for all A-League and W-League matches in May this year, before securing a deal to broadcast the Matildas and Socceroos matches in June. The acquisitions were made ahead of the launch of ViacomCBS&rsquo; new streaming service, Paramount+ on August 11.</p>
			<p>Mr Prosser said ViacomCBS, the owner of Network Ten, intends to reinvest in buying sports rights, and that the launch of Paramount+ has allowed for a different conversation with sporting codes and clients.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;One hundred per cent [we intend to invest]. We&rsquo;ve never shied away from the fact that we would always look at all rights, but having a [subscription] service as well as a linear and on-demand service, has allowed us to have a different conversation with sporting bodies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our desire now is to certainly grow in sport but it has to make sense from a ratings and audience point of view.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Network Ten previously broadcast The Big Bash League and V8 Supercars and over the past few years it lost these commercial deals to other television networks. Until the more recent agreements, the only sport that was set to air on Ten this year was the Victorian Racing Club&rsquo;s Melbourne Cup carnival. ViacomCBS is an emerging player in US sports broadcasting.</p>
			<p>Overseas, its streaming service Paramount+ shows the UEFA Champions League and Italy&rsquo;s Serie A in the US.</p>
			<p>Mr Prosser denied Ten paid too much for the local rights: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t comment on the price. Is it going to perform for us? Yes.&ldquo;</p>
			<p>He also signalled the network wants to secure a free-to-air deal for the 2023 FIFA Women&rsquo;s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Optus Sport won the rights to broadcast all games and may partner with a free-to-air broadcaster for some matches in the FIFA World Cup. &ldquo;We want to be the home of football,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And if that includes a World Cup, then excellent. But obviously, there&rsquo;s so many different factors that determine whether that would be in a Ten/ViacomCBS stable. That&rsquo;s obviously being worked through.&ldquo;</p>
			<p>Documents filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission last Friday show a 1 per cent dip in Ten&rsquo;s revenue from $598 million to $583 million for the 12 months. Ten&rsquo;s statutory loss was related to redundancy payments and costs with the restructure of news, operations and technology as well as write-downs in the value of programming rights and onerous contracts ($30.2 million).</p>
			<p>Ten has axed roles in several divisions since it was bought by ViacomCBS in 2017. The most recent cuts were in the news team and included the closure of online lifestyle and news website, 10Daily. The company also centralised its weekday 10 News First bulletins in Sydney and Melbourne, which led to the departures of Tim Bailey, Kerri-Anne Kennerley and Natarsha Belling.</p>
			<p>Underlying profit after tax was $48.1 million. Excluding significant items, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was $53.6 million.</p>
			<p>Ten said the COVID-19 impact came through the cancellation of the 2020 Australian Grand Prix and Australian MotoGP, and the temporary production shutdowns of The Bachelor Australia and The Bachelorette Australia. But the network said it had &ldquo;adequate liquidity&rdquo; to continue to operate in the current climate for at least the next 12 months.</p>
			<p>While revenue fell in 2020, Mr Prosser said its share of the total TV market had grown in 18 of the last 19 months.</p>
			<p>&rdquo;Shows such as I&rsquo;m A Celebrity Australia and MasterChef Australia had more interest in advertisers than ever before, both of which saw a record amount of sponsors,&rdquo; Mr Prosser said. &ldquo;January delivered a huge uplift in revenue and achieved its largest share for the month since 2018. &ldquo;Our second half is looking very promising and no doubt will continue on the same trajectory as the first half of 2021,&rdquo; he said.<br>

			<p><b><i>World's first commercial re-programmable satellite blasts into space<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Worlds_first_commercial_re-programmable_satellite_blasts_into_space_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>The world's first commercial fully re-programmable satellite lifted off from French Guiana on Friday on board an Ariane 5 rocket, ushering in a new era of more flexible communications.</p>
			<p>Unlike conventional models that are designed and &quot;hard-wired&quot; on Earth and cannot be repurposed once in orbit, the Eutelsat Quantum allows users to tailor the communications to their needs -- almost in real-time.</p>
			<p>The satellite will be placed in orbit some 36 minutes after the launch.</p>
			<p>Because it can be reprogrammed while orbiting in a fixed position 35,000 kilometres (22,000 miles) above the Earth, the Quantum can respond to changing demands for data transmission and secure communications during its 15-year lifetime, according to the European Space Agency.</p>
			<p>The 3.5 tonne Quantum model has eight communications beams, each of which can be modified to change its area of coverage and also the power of the telecommunications signal it emits. </p>
			<p>Using software made available to the customer, these changes can be made &quot;in a matter of minutes&quot;, according to Eutelsat. </p>
			<p>This means the satellite can be used to provide mobile coverage for moving objects such as aircraft or oceangoing vessels, or to provide coverage after a natural disaster or for one-off events.</p>
			<p>And at a time of growing concern over digital security -- as well as the possible weaponising of space -- Quantum is able to pinpoint the origin of signals emitted with or without malicious intent and take action to remedy the interference. </p>
			<p>The Quantum will cover a large geographical area from West Africa to Asia for 15 years. <br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.businessinsider.com.au/elon-musk-wants-to-cover-britain-with-starlinks-satellite-internet-report-2021-8<br>
			</p>
			<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s Starlink satellite internet venture has secured a license to construct a satellite ground station on the Isle of Man, which will provide &ldquo;blanket coverage&rdquo; across Great Britain, the Telegraph reports.</p>
			<p>New footage in Cuba shows the largest anti-government protests in decades</p>
			<p>Starlink, part of of Musk&rsquo;s SpaceX, has filed an application with the communications regulator for the Isle of Man to improve its broadband coverage for rural areas in northern Britain that cannot be reached by fiber broadband or 5G internet, the newspaper reported.</p>
			<p>By transmitting from a station on the island, which is west off the coast of northern Britain, Starlink can capitalize on the island&rsquo;s less crowded airwaves so their signal can reach these rural broadband holes, the Telegraph said.</p>
			<p>Starlink already has established satellite bases in Buckinghamshire and Cornwall. With the three ground stations and its network of satellites in orbit, the company is expected to beam down full broadband coverage for all of the UK, it said.</p>
			<p>The internet service would compete with other British broadband companies in Britain, particularly the UK government-owned OneWeb, which also works with a low Earth orbit satellite network.</p>
			<p>SpaceX is looking to provide Starlink satellite internet globally by this September and connecting in-flight internet service. The company has been working on launching 42,000 Starlink satellites into orbit by 2027 to support its global broadband signal.</p>
			<p>Global coverage of Starlink&rsquo;s service could allow more and more rural and underserved communities to get fast broadband.</p>
			<p>Starlink launched a UK limited test service earlier this year, charging &pound;89 ($US123 ($AU168)) a month, plus &pound;439 ($US610 ($AU831)) for a satellite dish, according to the Telegraph. More than 500,000 people have placed an order for Starlink internet, Musk said in May.</p>
			<p>Ofcom, the UK&rsquo;s communication regulator, said last week it is updating the terms and process for obtaining licenses for low-orbit satellites, like the ones Starlink uses, and were halting any current or new applications. However, the regulators said they were in the final stages of issuing one license that was developed with their proposed guideline. Ofcom did not comment on who filed the application.</p>
			<p>Starlink could not be reached by the time of publication.<br>

			<p>&quot;Whether to connect remote health facilities, mining operations, or large-scale agriculture, these enhancements help make the business NBN satellite service more accessible for eligible businesses and government organisations even in the most remote parts of continent and we look forward to delivering new capabilities to further improve the service in the future,&quot; NBN chief development officer for regional and remote Gavin Williams said.</p>
			<p>Earlier this year, the Elon Musk-fronted SpaceX told an Australian parliamentary committee that the company could begin to offer its Starlink broadband services to the nation's external territories as early as 2022.</p>
			<p>&quot;Certain more proximate islands within the external territories, notably the Ashmore, Cartier, and Coral Sea Islands, could be served by early 2022, when SpaceX has more fully populated its satellite constellation with ongoing launches and with the establishment of gateway earth stations at proximate mainland locations,&quot; it said.</p>
			<p>While geostationary satellites, like the Sky Muster ones used by NBN, have latency in the order of 600-800ms, those in low Earth orbit can provide 20-40ms of latency. Starlink users last year saw internet speeds of 134Mbps.</p>
			<p>During the same hearing, the Norfolk Island Regional Council pushed for the island to return to the way it was, which means restoring a cable connection to the island, despite the island having its own NBN Sky Muster spot beam.</p>
			<p>The council spent AU$8 million over five years on satellite connectivity, and for its money, it now gets a 113/37Mbps primary link with a 20/4Mbps redundant link. Norfolk Island previously had a cable connection, but it was cut. The island still has a cable landing station, and in 2003 the Australian government paid to have an &quot;extensive underground&quot; fibre to the node network installed, which now uses satellite backhaul.</p>
			<p>On Thursday, NBN said it would provide AU$5.2 million in the form of a &quot;COVID-19 relief credit payment&quot; to cover overage charges paid by retailers due to bandwidth spikes caused by lockdowns in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. <br>

			<p><b><i>Inmarsat unveils ORCHESTRA mobility network <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/29/inmarsat-unveils-orchestra-mobility-network/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Mobile satellite communications operator Inmarsat has unveiled plans for ORCHESTRA, describing it as the communications network of the future. In the largest ever transformation of its current services, Inmarsat ORCHESTRA will bring together existing geosynchronous (GEO) satellites with low earth orbit satellites (LEO) and terrestrial 5G into an integrated, high-performance solution.</p>
			<p>Whether for a ship in a crowded port, an aircraft preparing to land at LAX, or a defence force deployed in a remote location, ORCHESTRA is designed to meet evolving connectivity needs in the mobility market with a service unmatched by any competitor offering, planned or in existence.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;An orchestra brings different instruments together, each supporting the other and playing its role in the masterpiece,&rdquo; commented Rajeev Suri, CEO of Inmarsat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re building ORCHESTRA on the same concept. By combining the distinct qualities of GEO, LEO and 5G into a single network, we will deliver a service that is far greater than the sum of its parts. Our customers will benefit from dramatically expanded high throughput services around the world. This is the future of connectivity and Inmarsat is perfectly positioned to bring it to the world with its proven technology expertise, right base of customers and partners, and financial strength.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>According to Inmarsat, ORCHESTRA will open up a host of new and previously unattainable possibilities for industries across the world. New services include close-shore navigation for autonomous vessels, next-generation emergency safety services for maritime crews, secure and tactical private networks for governments and direct-to-cloud connections for airlines. New segments set to benefit from ORCHESTRA include energy rigs and drilling platforms, mid-market business aircraft, coastal vessels, smart passenger ships and urban air mobility.</p>
			<p>Inmarsat claims ORCHESTRA is unique because it draws together the benefits of multiple technologies to create one cohesive solution. LEO, GEO and terrestrial networks have never been combined at scale before to create a unified connectivity service for mobility customers. The result is a &lsquo;dynamic mesh network&rsquo; that will deliver high-performance connectivity everywhere. Bringing together the lowest average latency and fastest average speeds with unique resilience, ORCHESTRA will eliminate the industry-wide challenge of congested network &lsquo;hot spots&rsquo;.</p>
			<p>Inmarsat&rsquo;s existing GEO satellites &#150; both GX and L-band &#150; will continue to provide global coverage, high performance, security and resilience. Terrestrial 5G adds ultra-high capacity in busy &lsquo;hot spots&rsquo;, such as ports, airports, and sea canals. A small constellation of LEO satellites will layer additional high capacity over further high-demand areas such as oceanic flight corridors. As a result, the network will offer the highest capacity for mobility users worldwide, and at &lsquo;hot spots&rsquo;.</p>
			<p>The network will benefit from &lsquo;dynamic mesh&rsquo; technology, which allows individual customer terminals to direct traffic to and from other customer terminals. This means that a ship within reach of a 5G ground station can receive ample capacity for its own needs as well as route capacity onwards to other vessels beyond terrestrial reach. This effectively creates a mobile web of terminals that extend the network&rsquo;s reach and improve its performance and resilience.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;ORCHESTRA ensures Inmarsat is well positioned to deliver long-term, profitable growth by delivering new services to existing customers, targeting near-adjacent market segments, and maintaining a strong competitive position,&rdquo; stated Suri. &ldquo;We have a record of adopting the right technology at the right time. We plan to focus initially on delivering the ORCHESTRA terrestrial network, while preparing for a future LEO constellation in the range of 150-175 satellites. This is a highly cost-effective approach that leverages Inmarsat&rsquo;s leading GEO satellite networks as part of ORCHESTRA&rsquo;s unique multi-layer architecture.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The new approach means that Inmarsat can easily boost capacity in high-density areas such as ports and airports, ensuring customer needs continue to be met well into the future with capacity scaled directly to match their requirements. The initial five-year (2021-2026) total investment for ORCHESTRA is expected to be in the order of $100 million.<br>

			<p><b><i>Verizon, Samsung claim 5G C-band milestone <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/29/verizon-samsung-claim-milestone/<br>
			</p>
			<p>US multiplay telco Verizon and Samsung Electronics have completed an end-to-end fully virtualised 5G data session over C-band spectrum in a live network environment. The new milestone was reached in preparation for Verizon&rsquo;s upcoming 5G Ultra Wideband expansion using its newly-acquired C-band spectrum.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We have been driving the industry to large scale virtualisation using the advanced architecture we have built into our network from the core to the far edge,&rdquo; explained Adam Koeppe, Senior Vice President of Technology Planning at Verizon. &ldquo;This recent accomplishment paves the way for a more programmable, efficient, and scalable 5G network,&rdquo; &ldquo;Customers deserve more than mere access to 5G. They deserve 5G built with the highest, gold-standard engineering practices that have positioned Verizon as the most reliable industry leader for years.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The trials, conducted over Verizon&rsquo;s network (using C-band Special Temporary Authority granted to Verizon by the FCC) in Texas, Connecticut and Massachusetts, used Samsung&rsquo;s fully virtualised RAN (vRAN) solution built on its own software stack and C-band 64T64R Massive MIMO radio in coordination with Verizon&rsquo;s virtualised core. The trials achieved speeds commensurate with traditional hardware-based equipment.</p>
			<p>According to Verizon, virtualisation is critical to delivering the services promised by advanced 5G networks. Key 5G use cases such as massive scale IOT solutions, more robust consumer devices and solutions, AR/VR, remote healthcare, autonomous robotics in manufacturing environments, and ubiquitous smart city solutions, will heavily rely on the programmability of virtualised networks.</p>
			<p>Cloud native virtualised architecture leads to greater flexibility, faster delivery of services, greater scalability, and improved cost efficiency in networks, paving the way for wide-scale mobile edge computing and network slicing. This technology enables Verizon to respond rapidly to customers&rsquo; varied latency and computing needs. Virtualisation will also lower the barrier to entry for new vendors in the ecosystem. New entrants will accelerate innovation, reduce operating costs, and lay the groundwork for flexible network and cloud infrastructure closer to the customer, eventually leading to single digit millisecond latency.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re proud to mark another milestone following our first large-scale commercial 5G vRAN deployment for Verizon, which is currently servicing millions of users,&rdquo; declared Junehee Lee, Executive Vice President and Head of R&amp;D, Networks Business at Samsung Electronics. &ldquo;This trial reinforces our commitment to helping operators evolve their advanced 5G networks. This achievement represents our dedicated efforts in leading the transition to virtualisation, and helping Verizon realise greater efficiency, scalability and flexibility. vRAN is a powerful enabler for network transformation, and we aim to continue leading this journey.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Massive MIMO is an evolution in antenna arrays that uses a high number of transmitters which enables more possible signal paths between a device and a cell tower. It also reduces interference through beamforming, which directs the beam from the cell site directly to where the customer is resulting in higher and more consistent speeds for customers using apps and uploading and downloading files. This trial used Samsung&rsquo;s C-band 64T64R Massive MIMO radios that support digital/dynamic beamforming, SU-MIMO, MU-MIMO and dual connectivity and carrier aggregation.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Incorporating full, cloud-native virtualisation, Massive MIMO and beamforming into our network design and deployment will result in so much more than our customers merely seeing a 5G icon on their devices. This is 5G service optimised for peak performance,&rdquo; asserted Koeppe.</p>
			<p>The milestone follows Samsung&rsquo;s recent announcement on expanding its vRAN capability to support mid-band Massive MIMO radios&#151;a first for the industry. Samsung&rsquo;s C-band Massive MIMO radio is part of a complete C-band solutions portfolio.</p>
			<p>This virtualisation work comes on the heels of other work to speed the expansion of 5G Ultra Wideband service using C-band spectrum including:<br>
				&bull;successful trials integrating C-band with mmWave licensed spectrum,<br>
				&bull;securing new agreements with Verizon&rsquo;s tower partners, Crown and SBA Communications, which provide for process improvements including standardising and reducing forms and minimising legal reviews, and<br>
				&bull;installation of C-band equipment from Ericsson and Samsung Electronics Co.</p>
			<p>These combined efforts, along with ongoing lab and field trials to optimise 5G technology on C-band spectrum will allow Verizon to offer expanded mobility and broadband services to millions more consumers and businesses as soon as the spectrum is cleared.</p>
			<p>In the first quarter of 2022, Verizon expects to put into service the new 5G C-band spectrum in the initial 46 markets and to provide 5G Ultra Wideband service to 100 million people. Over 2022 and 2023, coverage is expected to increase to more than 175 million people and by 2024 and beyond, when the remaining C-band spectrum is cleared, more than 250 million people are expected to have access to Verizon&rsquo;s 5G Ultra Wideband service on C-band spectrum.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.satellitetoday.com/broadband/2021/07/27/rsccs-new-director-general-speaks-on-expanding-internet-access/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Russian Satellite Communications Company (RSCC) new Director General Alexey Volin gave some of his first public remarks this week since taking the helm of Russia&rsquo;s state-owned satellite operator. Volin spoke at the Territory of Meanings All-Russian Youth Educational Forum, and said RSCC&rsquo;s principal challenge now is to provide access to the internet throughout Russia.</p>
			<p>Volin became RSCC&rsquo;s new director general late last month replacing Yuri Prokhorov.</p>
			<p>He highlighted the fact that large parts of Russia&rsquo;s territory with its mineral deposits and rail and highway and river routes, and the Northern Sea Route is currently outside internet coverage. &ldquo;Our task is to ensure that people working in the Arctic, in remote and hard-to-reach areas, on railway, river, maritime and air transport do have the internet, as well as access to information, electronic services and communications, and assistance which they can request, if necessary,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>RSCC plans to use its satellites in Geostationary Orbit (GEO) and ones in highly elliptical orbits to address the problem. The entity is currently working with NIIR to develop and design ground satellite terminals that can be installed on sea, river, railway transport, as well as buses, to provide on-the-move communication.<br>

			<p><b><i>Astronomers propose 'SatHub' to address growing threat of satellite megaconstellations<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.space.com/sathub-idea-threat-satellite-megaconstellations-astonomy<br>
			</p>
			<p>Some astronomers suggest setting up a &quot;SatHub&quot; to address the growing threat that satellite megaconstellations pose to the night sky &#151; but funding and support are necessary to make it happen.</p>
			<p>The primary goal of the international SatHub project would be implementing and adapting plans for observations as new satellites go up, team members said. A secondary goal would be training, outreach and analysis concerning low Earth orbit satellites for the greater community.</p>
			<p>SatHub was one of the key recommendations emerging from a recent workshop, called Satellite Constellations 2 (SATCON2), to figure out how astronomers can best perform observations in the face of swiftly growing satellite numbers. (Some satellite companies also participated in workshop discussions.)</p>
			<p>&quot;That may include a proposal to the International Astronomical Union,&quot; SATCON2 co-chair Connie Walker said during a preliminary press conference on July 16, referring to the SatHub idea. The IAU is one of the largest organizations representing astronomers and astronomy interests around the world. </p>
			<p>&quot;They have a call that just went out recently on such a center, so stay tuned for more on that,&quot; added Walker, a scientist at the National Science Foundation's NOIRLab.</p>
			<p>Proposals are due to the IAU on Sept. 10, and deliberations will likely continue until at least the end of 2021, representatives added in the workshop. They did not give a timeline for when SatHub could be available, but this would likely depend in large part on funding.</p>
			<p>Ideally, companies that send satellites to space should put money toward the center, said Meredith Rawls, a research scientist at the University of Washington who was also the observations working group chair for SATCON2.</p>
			<p>&quot;The idea here is to have a one-stop shop for all of your different needs pertaining to low Earth orbit satellite constellation observations,&quot; Rawls said during the press conference. &quot;We really would like to get out ahead of this and avoid reinventing the wheel by having lots of individual siloed groups addressing the problem, and instead have a single landing place for all of these different observations and related analyses to land.&quot;</p>
			<p>SATCON2 had three objectives, according to a press release from NOIRLab and the American Astronomical Society (AAS), which jointly organized the workshop: to figure out what is required to implement the previous recommendations from 2020's SATCON1; to have astronomers and satellite operators work together for policy frameworks and strategies; and to increase the diversity of all stakeholders.</p>
			<p>SATCON1 participants produced a report last year warning that the impacts on astronomy of satellite megaconstellations in low Earth orbit &quot;are estimated to range from negligible to extreme.&quot; All-sky survey telescopes that depend on lengthy light exposures free from interference will feel the biggest effects, the report concluded.</p>
			<p>Key recommendations from 2020 included limiting satellite altitudes in low Earth orbit to 370 miles (600 kilometers); reducing satellite brightness; developing image-processing software to minimize satellite trails; and making orbital information about satellites widely available so astronomers can point away from them.</p>
			<p>This year, SATCON2 astronomers pointed to challenges in keeping up with the growing pace of satellite launches. Among the conclusions was that substantial development will be needed in software solutions, said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who was co-chair of the SATCON2 algorithms working group.</p>
			<p>&quot;We've tried to identify what existing software is relevant to the software problems, but we find that a lot of it is specialized to particular instruments or particular observatories, and it's going to need some work to be generalized,&quot; he warned during the press conference. &quot;Also, there are big gaps where the software just doesn't exist. We do need a significant software development effort, and that's going to require substantial resources and funding.&quot;</p>
			<p>Since satellites are always launching and software takes time to be developed, &quot;we're going to need these resources as soon as possible,&quot; McDowell added. And the money will not only be needed for software, he added: Spectroscopic observations in particular are likely to be highly affected, so some observatories will likely need to spend money on hardware such as auxiliary spotting cameras.</p>
			<p>The problem also goes beyond technical issues. Other commonly cited problems of constellations include space junk and crowding in terms of radio interference between satellites. These issues were not addressed in the workshop, but there were discussions concerning the impact on Indigenous peoples, as lack of access to the sky is seen as a cultural loss, said James Lowenthal, an astronomy professor at Smith College at Northampton, Massachusetts, who was the co-chair of the SATCON2 community engagement working group. (That said, he warned, not all Indigenous groups want the same thing.)</p>
			<p>&quot;The sky belongs to everyone,&quot; Lowenthal said. &quot;People are impacted by changes in the sky. Megaconstellations are a global issue because space is a global commons. The sky is part of the environment &#x2026; and ecosystems depend on the night sky, and on each other, echoing the intersectional, interdependent nature of the many strands of this complex issue.&quot;</p>
			<p>Lowenthal suggested that, when coming with policy solutions, stakeholders should look to lessons learned from past global commons agreements such as the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer, which led to some restrictions on CFCs. But not all such agreements were that successful, he said.</p>
			<p>&quot;Telephones, trains, planes, cars, fossil fuels, the internet itself &#151; all of these technologies burst upon the scene, were disruptive, produced profound change in society, to be followed by some modicum of regulation and lawmaking. Some were more successful than others at protecting public interests,&quot; Lowenthal said.</p>
			<p>One way of mitigating the megaconstellation issue might be for those involved in satellite constellations to anticipate impacts long before satellites launch, said Richard Green of the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory, director of the Large Binocular Telescope Observatory and chair of the SATCON2 policy working group.</p>
			<p>The policy working group &quot;wanted to encourage operators to consider effects on astronomy, early in their development of their constellations,&quot; Green said. Acknowledging that SpaceX creates satellites in-house, most other companies contract for construction, he added. &quot;They can adjust designs early, but it's very hard to change once they're in production.&quot;</p>
			<p>Among other measures, the policy working group urged individual countries &#151; who are responsible for their launching entities, under the United Nations' 1967 Outer Space Treaty recognized in international space law frameworks &#151; to grant licenses to satellite operators only after the environmental impact of satellites has been assessed and minimized.</p>
			<p>Despite the Outer Space Treaty's age, Green noted, it remains a useful tool for policy discussions. &quot;It is a very flexible backbone that provides the principles under which nations can operate together, to define how some new phenomenon like satellite constellations fits under the expectations of a spacefaring nation,&quot; he said.</p>
			<p>Constellations are not a new concept in space exploration, but they have been proliferating in recent years due to the ability to launch fleets of small but capable satellites on a single rocket. The most cited concern is the SpaceX Starlink constellation, which has an estimated 1,630 operational satellites as of July 2021, according to calculations from McDowell, and is growing fast.</p>
			<p>&quot;We started the SATCOM workshops after the launch in May 2019 of the first tranche of Starlink satellites,&quot; SATCOM2 co-chair Jeff Hall, an astronomer at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, said during the press conference. </p>
			<p>&quot;That led to the idea we should all get together, in a community sense, and see what might be done about some of the impacts on astronomy. We know these satellites are perhaps up to a billion times brighter than the faintest objects astronomers study and have a significant impact on ground-based observatories, which require pristine dark skies to perform their research.&quot;</p>
			<p>SpaceX eventually hopes to have as many as 42,000 Starlink satellites providing broadband service, and more companies are looking to grow their own fleets, including Amazon's Project Kuiper (which has yet to launch any craft) and OneWeb, which has already lofted 254 operational satellites.</p>
			<p>Lowenthal praised some satellite companies for being &quot;significantly and substantially involved in the planning of this workshop,&quot; along with promising to &quot;commit resources&quot; to reduce the effects of satellite constellations. </p>
			<p>That said, he pointed to challenges. There are no firm regulations yet forcing companies to adjust their satellites to help astronomy observations, he said. Further, the competition has already been tough and resulted in bankruptcies. While Lowenthal did not name any particulars, one commonly cited example is OneWeb's recent Chapter 11 proceedings and subsequent ownership change.</p>
			<p>&quot;Even the business model is on shaky ground,&quot; he said. &quot;We've already seen bankruptcies, and having a completely unregulated atmosphere is not necessarily the best for them, either. I think there's broad agreement that regulation is going to happen. Of course it's a slow process, but that's what we're launching with this workshop.&quot;</p>
			<p>More than 350 astronomers, satellite operators, space policy specialists and advocates for dark skies &#151; skies with a minimum of light pollution and satellite interference &#151; attended SATCON2 from 40 countries, representatives said. A final report will be available around the end of September.<br>

			<p><b><i>International satellites can&rsquo;t avoid US regulatory fees<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.courthousenews.com/international-satellites-cant-avert-us-regulatory-fees/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The move does away with an exemption that international satellite companies with access to the U.S. market have enjoyed for nearly two decades. </p>
			<p>WASHINGTON (CN) &#151; For the first time since 1993, the D.C. Circuit mandated Tuesday, international satellite companies with access to the U.S. market must pay U.S. regulatory fees. </p>
			<p>The companies initially did not have to pay these fees, pursuant to section 9 of the Communications Act. When Congress amended this law in 2018, however, the Federal Communications Commission adopted a paid licensing scheme for international satellite companies and spurred a federal complaint based in Canada, France, the Netherlands and the U.K.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It was only in the 11th hour that they came up with this brand-new theory: oh no, we&rsquo;ve gone back and looked at legislative history from 30 years ago, decided we interpreted it incorrectly 25 years ago, and now we have a new view of what section 9 has always meant,&rdquo; Wayne Kenneth Ferree, counsel for Telesat Canada, told a panel of the D.C. Circuit during oral arguments in April. </p>
			<p>The fees can be up to $1 million annually for Telesat and Eutelsat, up to $300,000 for Kin&eacute;is and Hiber, and up to $400,000 for Inmarsat. The companies call it unfair for them to pay American fees on top of what they already owe in their home countries &#151; especially because U.S. companies don&rsquo;t have to pay similar fees in Canada, France and the like. </p>
			<p>When a three-judge panel threw out the challenge last month, they ruled that an agency can lawfully change its interpretation of a statute: there is nothing in the text of the statute exempting non-U.S. licensed space stations from imposing regulatory fees.</p>
			<p>Deputy court clerk Daniel Reidy solidified the move with a mandate Tuesday that links to the circuit's June 4 decision.</p>
			<p>The commission argued that, because foreign-licensed satellites benefit from the commission&rsquo;s oversight and regulation &#151; and because it devotes significant resources to processing international petitions &#151; abiding by the 1995 interpretation places the burden of the regulatory fees on the shoulders of U.S. licensees. </p>
			<p>Additionally, the FCC said, there are no more Comsat satellites, and the market has changed drastically in the past 25 years: commercial foreign-licensed satellites with general U.S. market access didn&rsquo;t even exist until 1997. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;When the Conference Report was written, the relevant category of satellites &#151; foreign-licensed commercial satellites with general U.S. market access &#151; simply didn&rsquo;t exist,&rdquo; U.S. Circuit Judge Laurence H. Silberman wrote for the court. &ldquo;Thus, Congress was unlikely to have contemplated the type of satellites at issue in this case.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The Bush-appinted Silberman was joined by U.S. Circuit Judge David S. Tatel, a Clinton appointee, and U.S. Senior Circuit Judge David B. Sentelle, a Reagan appointee. </p>
			<p>The Communications Act does allow fee exemptions for government and nonprofit entities, amateur operators and non-commercial radio and television stations, but the satellite companies bringing the lawsuit don&rsquo;t fit into any of those categories.</p>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.adnews.com.au/news/foxtel-closes-45-million-deal-for-the-national-basketball-league<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Foxtel Group announced a three-year agreement with the National Basketball League which will see every game of the NBL season and finals live on ESPN broadcast on Foxtel and streamed on Kayo.</p>
			<p>Commercial details haven't been revealed but the deal is reported to be worth 45 million. </p>
			<p>Patrick Delany, Foxtel CEO, says there is no doubt audience interest in the NBL is at a tipping point.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We have a long and rich history with the NBL and over the years have seen the players, coaches, clubs and national participation in the sport go from strength to strength,&quot; he says.</p>
			<p>&quot;Our partnership with ESPN allows us to use the growing scale of our Foxtel and Kayo sports platform to significantly build audience engagement.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;With 2.4 million households now watching sport on Foxtel and streaming Kayo, the Foxtel Group provides the largest audience of sports fans in the country. As a key broadcast partner of ESPN in Australia, we are pleased to be bringing all NBL games of this world-class competition to fans live and on demand this season.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;And to take reach of the NBL even further, we will be streaming two games from every round on Kayo Freebies. With almost 90% of Australian households with internet access, this will unlock even more opportunities to grow basketball in Australia.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>TV audiences of NBL grew 72% between 2014 and 2020.</p>
			<p>Larry Kestelman, NBL owner and executive chairman, says Foxtelp&rsquo;s coverage on Foxtel as well as Kayo Sports completes the best broadcast deal in the history of the NBL.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I want to thank ESPN and Foxtel Group for their continued support, and for having the belief and confidence in us as a competition and organisation,&rdquo; he says.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;With more than 1.1 million people playing basketball nationally each year, our sport is exploding in popularity and we cannot wait to work together to attract and entertain a legion of new members, fans and supporters, and show them what our league has to offer.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This media deal is a game changer in every sense and shows we are a league that continues to rise in stature, reputation and popularity. Our fans are at the heart of everything we do and there is something for everyone in this exciting new deal and it serves as a huge vote of confidence in our clubs, players and the path we&rsquo;re on together.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Every game of the new NBL season will be available on Foxtel and streamed on Kayo from October 2021.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab says a 12-day launch window for its next mission will open tomorrow, with a lift-off possible tomorrow (July 29) between 6pm and 8pm from Launch Complex 1 at Mahia.</p>
			<p>The launch will be the first since the May 15 failure of the &quot;Running Out of Toes&quot; flight, which was recently pinned on a failure with the Electron rocket's second-stage ignition system.</p>
			<p>The flight will be a crucial one for Rocket Lab, which will be looking to get at least one more successful mission under its belt before its US$4.1 billion Nasdaq listing, expected before the end of September.</p>
			<p>The client is the US Air Force, which eschews such frivolity - specifically the USAF's new United States Space Force (USSF) division, setup under former President Donald Trump.</p>
			<p>The mission will deploy an Air Force Research Laboratory-sponsored demonstration satellite called Monolith, Rocket Lab said in a statement.</p>
			<p>In a recent Business Hub interview Peter Beck reiterated that his company only launches research or &quot;demonstrator&quot; satellites for the military and draws the line at military-operational satellites. The CEO also repeated his argument that people have benefited from dual-use technologies developed originally for the military, including GPS, internet and weather satellites.<br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/27/spacex-asks-fcc-for-maritime-links/<br>
			</p>
			<p>SpaceX has asked the FCC for permission to install two (normally) ground-based Starlink user terminals aboard a maritime vessel.</p>
			<p>The application says the request is &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; and would run September 1st until October 31st.</p>
			<p>The full request says: &ldquo;[to] operate two mobile ground-based Starlink user terminals aboard a maritime vessel while embarked in US territorial waters in the North Atlantic Ocean.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>It isn&rsquo;t known what SpaceX intends to do with the experimental dishes, but it is worth remembering that the rocket company has two of its own vessels in the region. They are the &lsquo;drone&rsquo; landing barges which are used for booster landings.</p>
			<p>More traditionally an installation was made in Oklahoma by the tribal Cherokee Nation by Chief Chuck Hoskin saying the tribe needs the SpaceX technology for its internet connectivity.<br>

			<p><b><i>NT-Thaicom pact promoted<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2154747/nt-thaicom-pact-promoted<br>
			</p>
			<p>National Telecom (NT) needs to partner with SET-listed satellite service provider Thaicom, allowing it to operate the Thaicom 4 and 6 satellites after the firm's 30-year concession ends in September, says Digital Economy and Society (DES) Minister Chaiwut Thanakamanusorn.</p>
			<p>Mr Chaiwut said the type of pact remains unsettled, as it could be an employment contract, partnership deal or outsourcing agreement.</p>
			<p>Thaicom operates broadband satellite Thaicom 4 and broadcasting satellite Thaicom 6 through a revenue sharing concession regime.</p>
			<p>Ownership of the two satellites is slated to be transferred to the DES Ministry after the concession ends on Sept 10.</p>
			<p>As the operational life of the two satellites can continue beyond the expiry of the concession, the ministry has the right to maintain operations.</p>
			<p>The ministry previously assigned CAT Telecom to look after Thaicom 4 and 6 satellites after the concession expiry, but CAT and TOT were merged to form NT in January.</p>
			<p>Thaicom has been operating satellite services for three decades and it can serve as a partner with NT, Mr Chaiwut said.</p>
			<p>&quot;A clearer idea of the collaboration between NT and Thaicom is likely before the concession expires&quot;, he said.</p>
			<p>Thaicom chief executive Anant Kaewruamvongs said the company's 30-year concession saw the allocation of 13.7 billion baht in revenue sharing from the operation of six satellites with the state.</p>
			<p>&quot;We will help ensure smooth transition of the operation as this is the responsibility of the concessionaire,&quot; Mr Anant said.</p>
			<p>Thaicom operates Thaicom 7 and 8 satellites under a single licence granted by the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), which requires a 5.75% licence fee payment.</p>
			<p>Thaicom 7 launched into orbit in 2012 and began operating in 2014.</p>
			<p>Thaicom 8 launched into orbit in May 2016.</p>
			<p>Mr Chaiwut acknowledged the DES Ministry is in the arbitration process with Thaicom regarding two disputes.</p>
			<p>The ministry considers Thaicom 7 and 8 satellites to be part of Thaicom's concession and is demanding the company provide revenue sharing.</p>
			<p>Thaicom insists the two satellites are operated under a licence from the NBTC, which requires it to make a licence fee payment to the regulator.</p>
			<p>Another dispute concerns Thaicom taking the Thaicom 5 satellite out of orbit in February 2020 before the concession expired.</p>
			<p>The ministry demands Thaicom build and deliver a replacement satellite for Thaicom 5 or pay compensation of around 7 billion baht if it cannot do so.</p>
			<p>Thaicom disagrees, arguing the ministry was informed in advance about the satellite's lifespan before it was approved for launch.</p>
			<p>The firm also indicated it consulted the DES Ministry and NBTC seeking approval before deorbiting the satellite.</p>
			<p>The ministry said it was informed by Thaicom in 2017 that Thaicom 5's engineering lifespan would end by September 2020 as the fuel in its propulsion system would be exhausted.</p>
			<p>Thaicom offered to connect a new propulsion system to the satellite and asked to extend the concession term, according to the ministry.</p>
			<p>The ministry agreed in principle with the installation of the new propulsion system, but refused to review the concession.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacenews.com/china-is-working-on-a-relay-satellite-to-support-lunar-polar-missions/<br>
			</p>
			<p>HELSINKI &#151; China is developing a new lunar relay satellite to support future exploration missions to the south pole of the moon. </p>
			<p>The country is planning to send the Chang&rsquo;e-7 spacecraft to the lunar south pole around 2024. Objectives include survey the region and seek evidence of water ice using an orbiter, lander, rover and a small hopping probe to investigate shadowed craters.</p>
			<p>The mission is one of the first for an initial phase of a proposed joint International Lunar Research Station with Russia and potentially other partners.</p>
			<p>A dedicated relay satellite is now being developed to facilitate a link between multiple surface spacecraft at the lunar south pole&#151;the location of which poses line-of-sight issues for communications&#151;and Earth, according to a paper published in Space: Science &amp; Technology.</p>
			<p>China currently has a lunar relay satellite stationed in orbit around the second Earth-moon Lagrange point at around 65,000 kilometers beyond the moon. Launched in May 2018, the Queqiao satellite serves a communications relay role that allows the Chang&rsquo;e-4 lander and rover mission to operate on the far side of the moon. </p>
			<p>The new Chinese lunar relay satellite will inherit a similar, large 4.2-meter-diameter parabolic antenna and the hydrazine propulsion used by Queqiao. It will however have a wet mass of 600 kilograms and thus be more massive than the roughly 450-kilogram wet mass Queqiao. The satellite is designed for a nominal 8-year mission lifetime.</p>
			<p>The new satellite will operate in an inclined highly elliptical frozen orbit. It will have a perilune of 300&#x2009;kilometers and apolune of 8,600&#x2009;kilometers and an inclination of 54.8 degrees. This will allow communication links for over 8 hours of the roughly 12-hour period orbit.</p>
			<p>The relay satellite could launch on a dedicated launcher or as part of the Chang&rsquo;e-7 stack, according to the paper authored by Zhang Lihua at DFH Satellite Co., Ltd., a satellite-developing arm of the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST). A second relay satellite could be developed if 100 percent coverage is required.</p>
			<p>China is planning to follow Chang&rsquo;e-7 with the Chang&rsquo;e-8 technology demonstration mission to the lunar south pole later in the 2020s, which is to include in-situ resource utilization and 3D-printing technology tests. The Chang&rsquo;e-6 lunar sample return is also expected to target the South Pole-Aitken Basin, a vast impact basin extending from Aitken crater at 18 degrees south down to the lunar South Pole, around 2024.</p>
			<p>In the long term the paper proposes a future Chinese lunar communication infrastructure in order to cope with an expected increased spacecraft and the needs of human lunar exploration. </p>
			<p>For this the creation of a lunar information network including orbiting and surface elements is proposed, which will also incorporate navigational data. Use of new optical communication technologies for extremely high data rates is also proposed.</p>
			<p>Beyond this a &ldquo;solar system internet, operating like terrestrial internet, to provide network layer services to users&rdquo; should be developed. It also suggests the system should be an &ldquo;open, interoperable architecture&rdquo; in order to &ldquo;enable any number of national, international, and commercial service providers to offer services.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>China is not the only space actor looking at lunar communications. NASA is in the early phases of a concept called LunaNet that would place a network of satellites around the moon to support the Artemis program and other lunar missions. ESA also recently awarded study contracts for lunar communications and navigation systems for its Moonlight initiative.</p>
			<p>Chang&rsquo;e-7 will also not be the only mission to include a &ldquo;hopper&rdquo;. The mini spacecraft will seek to investigate shadowed craters, using a payload named the Water Molecule and Hydrogen Isotope Analyzer.</p>
			<p>Last week NASA elected to fund a mini extreme mobility lunar vehicle, Micro-Nova, to be developed in partnership between Arizona State University and Intuitive Machines. The hopping spacecraft will likewise seek to explore permanently shaded regions, launching with the second Nova-C lander to the lunar south pole in December 2022.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://news.satnews.com/2021/07/25/noaa-goes-17-anomaly-rectified/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Thanks to Mr. Carl Reinemann, notification was received that the NOAA GOES-17 satellite had moved into a Safe Hold Mode due to an anomaly that affected all satellite operations&#x2026;</p>
			<p>Thankfully, on July 23 at 2:51 p.m., the agency issued the following statement&#x2026;</p>
			<p>NOAA&rsquo;s GOES-17 is out of safe-hold mode and engineers expect its six instruments to return to normal operations soon. The probable cause of yesterday&rsquo;s anomaly appears to be a memory bit error in the spacecraft computer. The engineering team says the computer has been responding correctly to commands. </p>
			<p>Earlier this morning, the Advanced Baseline Imager and Magnetometer were restored and data are flowing. The remaining four instruments are expected to come online later this morning.  The team expects some minor, short-term data quality issues while the instruments are being recalibrated, but GOES-17 is on track for a full recovery with no lasting effects to the satellite.<br>

			<p><b><i>SpaceX wins $178m NASA contract <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/26/spacex-wins-178m-nasa-contract/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s Space Exploration rocket company has received another major endorsement. NASA is awarding it a $178 million (&euro;151.1m) launch contract to send a mission &#150; the Europa Clipper &#150; to one of Jupiter&rsquo;s moons.</p>
			<p>The news will not affect SpaceX&rsquo;s imminent start of its Starlink broadband-by-satellite service, but it shows that NASA believes that SpaceX represents better value for money than its other options which would have been sure to have included the United Launch Alliance (ULA) of Atlas and Delta (although NASA has not confirmed who precisely was involved in the Jupiter tender).</p>
			<p>It isn&rsquo;t the largest NASA contract to be awarded to SpaceX. In April 2021, SpaceX received a $2.9 billion contract to build a lunar lander spacecraft for the upcoming Artemis programme which will again take NASA astronauts to the Moon. That award was objected to by Jeff Bezos Blue Origin business as well as defence contractor Dynetics Inc.</p>
			<p>The new contract is targeting Jupiter&rsquo;s Europa icy moon which experts suggest might sustain life.</p>
			<p>Elon Musk, as well as members of his executive team, have said that SpaceX will open up its initial Starlink broadband service in August. Starlink is &ldquo;operational now in about 12 countries, and more are being added every month,&rdquo; Musk said, talking at the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, SpaceX gained a legal benefit on July 20th when a Federal Appeals Court judge ruled that Viasat could not continue with its objections to the Starlink system. Viasat wanted all future launches halted while an environmental impact study was carried out. The judges in the case ruled that Viasat &ldquo;had not achieved the stringent requirements for a stay [halt].&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>DVB approves DVB-I over 5G commercial requirements <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/26/dvb-approves-dvb-i-over-5g-commercial-requirements/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The DVB Project has approved commercial requirements for DVB-I service support over 5G networks and systems. Work has already commenced in DVB&rsquo;s Technical Module to provide extensions to the relevant existing specifications &#150; including DVB-I service discovery and DVB-DASH &#150; to address the use cases and requirements collected and agreed by the Commercial Module.</p>
			<p>Earlier in July 2021, the DVB Steering Board approved the publication of the commercial requirements, now available for download as DVB BlueBook C100. The document not only provides a set of 70 technical and procedural requirements, but also introduces key elements of 5G networks and systems related to media distribution including 5G Broadcast, 5G Media Streaming and other ongoing activities in 3GPP. In particular, LTE-based 5G Broadcast (as defined in ETSI TS 103 720) provides all functionalities to operate classical TV services including receive-only, free-to-air and high-power high-tower network infrastructures. The commercial requirements were developed based on six guiding use cases, all documented in an annex to BlueBook C100.</p>
			<p>5G-based technologies promise to enable content and service providers to access mobile devices, typically interfacing with installable apps. 5G-based distribution to other types of receiver, such as moving vehicles, devices connected to roof-top mounted antennas or 5G-based home gateways, is not excluded. A particular benefit of DVB-I services over 5G is the ability to support integrated DVB-I hybrid services, i.e., services for which the basic broadcast distribution is augmented with unicast for extended service coverage, lower distribution costs, improved quality and additional user experiences.</p>
			<p>The commercial requirements themselves are structured in technical and procedural aspects. Generally, the requirements ask for specifications to support different Rel-16-based 5G operation modes, namely 5G Broadcast, unicast-based 5G Media Streaming, concurrent delivery of the same service over both modes,  and hybrid DVB-I services. In all cases it is expected that the specifications reuse existing DVB technologies to the extent possible and provide commonalities with other IP-based DVB delivery means.</p>
			<p>The technically-oriented requirements are clustered in different service-operation phases, namely provisioning, announcement and detection, components, distribution and delivery, quality and monitoring, as well as client-related aspects. While the requirements are extensive and detailed, for example also including security-related aspects, it is expected that many are already covered by the existing DVB-I specification or would only demand minor extensions. This is a benefit of the original DVB-I design to provide a TV service platform independent of the access layer.</p>
			<p>Beyond the technically-oriented requirements, C100 explicitly addresses different aspects related to collaboration.</p>
			<p>First of all, collaboration is a key issue for potentially successful operation of DVB services over 5G, as broadcast service providers and 5G network operators need to collaborate to beneficially use DVB-I functionalities and 5G functionalities for DVB-I service distribution. This aspect is addressed in the requirements by asking the technical group to provide specifications for network and client-side interfaces and APIs to formalise the communication across these two business domains.</p>
			<p>Secondly, the DVB-I over 5G system is expected to align with common industry practices, for example those developed in 3GPP, 5G-MAG or other organisations that contribute to successful deployment of media and TV services over 5G.</p>
			<p>Finally, an important aspect in the development of DVB specifications is the availability of Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) tools. Collaborative efforts with other organisations such as 5G-MAG, 3GPP or DASH-IF are expected to be initiated in order to support reference and interoperability efforts. As an example, the newly established 5G-MAG Reference Tool project may create synergies with V&amp;V tools for DVB-I over 5G.</p>
			<p>Updates to relevant DVB specifications to support fully DVB-I over 5G are expected to be completed in Q3, 2022. However, with expected continuous extensions of 5G technologies in upcoming releases, the first release of DVB-I over 5G may be only the starting point in a long-lasting endeavour to enhance DVB-based TV services by also leveraging 5G-based distribution systems.<br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/23/starlinks-broadband-satellites-nearly-in-position/<br>
			</p>
			<p>A report from aerospace engineer Michael Volle says that SpaceX&rsquo;s Starlink &lsquo;broadband by satellite&rsquo; low Earth orbiting constellation is almost completely deployed in space.</p>
			<p>Volle says that the Starlink system has just to fill four remaining orbital planes, commented: &ldquo;The satellites destined for those planes are currently heading to them. Everything will [have been] launched and raised in under 22 months.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He adds: &ldquo;A few orbit planes need several more sats, and several more need one or two, but those sats are in space too.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Volle&rsquo;s data shows that the orbits numbered 18, 34 and 60 still need filling with some satellites out of a total constellation of 72 orbital planes.</p>
			<p>A SpaceX Starlink launch has been expected during July from the Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. This will be a batch of satellites with polar orbits, but as yet no number of satellites on the launch has been supplied, or the date for launch.<br>

						</i></b><br>
					From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Funding_partnerships_launch_the_UK_Australia_Space_Bridge_999.html<br>
				</p>
				<p>The first collaborative activity within the UK-Australia Space Bridge framework is being launched today by Australia's SmartSat CRC, UK Science and Innovation Network, and the Satellite Applications Catapult with the support of Austrade and the Australian Space Agency.</p>
				<p>The Satellite Applications Catapult, based at the Harwell Space Cluster in Oxfordshire, and Australia's Smartsat CRC will fund research projects that align to the mutual benefits of both countries and create collaboration through the Space Bridge.</p>
				<p>These preliminary phase projects aim to develop and foster partnerships across academia and industry in both the UK and Australia. It is expected the projects will lead to larger collaborative research projects that grow industry capacity, provide an innovative end-product or capability, and build upon the respective space ecosystems of each country.</p>
				<p>Projects will address four topic areas identified as strategically beneficial to the mutual interests of each country. These topics are Earth Observation and Climate Resilience; Agriculture and Land Management from Space; Enabling Connectivity and Innovative Space Communications; and Quantum Technologies for Space.</p>
				<p>Sam Adlen, Chief Strategy Officer at the Satellite Applications Catapult said: &quot;I am delighted that we are able to build on the hugely innovative and enabling UK-Australia Space Bridge and are able to make the first funding available for research projects that span the space industry across our two nations. This initial funding will begin to stimulate powerful partnerships that will drive opportunities for growth, prosperity, and space enabled benefits in both countries and for the sector as a whole.&quot;</p>
				<p>Arfan Chaudhry, International Director at the UK Space Agency, said: &quot;As we grow the UK space sector and strengthen our international engagement, we are forging new and deeper partnerships to exploit opportunities and tackle challenges around the globe.</p>
				<p>&quot;This Space Bridge with our Australian friends will unlock funding and give life to ideas that will help combat climate change, deliver better communications and support sustainable agriculture.&quot;</p>
				<p>SmartSatCRC Chief Executive Officer Professor Andy Koronios said the Space Bridge Framework Arrangement is an important step in leveraging the significant research capabilities of both countries.</p>
				<p>&quot;This is the first joint initiative to be undertaken since the announcement of the Space Bridge with the backing of both the UK and Australian governments. It is just the beginning of the exciting collaborative partnerships that aim for long term growth and commercial opportunities for both countries,&quot; Prof Koronios said.</p>
				<p>British High Commissioner to Australia, Vicki Treadell said these projects will be the first step in significant partnership.</p>
				<p>&quot;It is wonderful to see the UK-Australia Space Bridge partnership in action with the provision of new funding for exciting space research projects, said Ms Treadell.</p>
				<p>&quot;This is an important first step in building our joint UK/Australian space sector capability and illustrates yet again the value of our partnership approach to scientific innovation.&quot;</p>
				<p>Australian Space Agency Head, Enrico Palermo, said the Space Bridge Framework Arrangement is a valuable partnership to ensure Australian businesses and researchers have greater opportunities to showcase their talents to the world.</p>
				<p>&quot;The arrangement will open doors to build local capability, as well as significantly boosting our collaboration with the UK Space Agency,&quot; Mr Palermo said.</p>
				<p>It is anticipated four projects, which must be completed by 30 June 2022, will be funded up to Pounds 50,000 per project. SmartSat CRC will be manage the assessment process, in collaboration with the UK Science and Innovation Network and the Satellite Applications Catapult. Projects should involve UK and Australia partners and align to the SA Catapult Roadmap or SmartSat CRC Strategic Plan.</p>
				<p>Applications are due by 5pm Australian Eastern Standard Time, Monday 30 August 2021.<br>

			<p>(NHK previously has conducted tests of its Super Hi-Vision technology, including uses during the 2012 Olympics in London and the 2016 Rio Olympics but downconverted much of that footage because so few 8K displays existed.) </p>
			<p>The broadcaster plans separate 2K Summer Olympics coverage on its General TV 2K terrestrial channel and a simulcast of the 2K presentation in 4K UHD on BS4K. </p>
			<p>Coverage of the Olympics in 4K and 8K will be the first on NHK&rsquo;s BS4K and BS8K since it launched the satellite channels in December 2018. &ldquo;We hope to provide viewers with a fully immersive experience that makes them feel like they are watching the events at the venues,&rdquo; said NHK executive director of broadcasting Masagaki Satoru. </p>
			<p>NHK began work on its Super Hi-Vision 8K television system in 1995, showing the world the incremental progress it was making on development of the concept and technology at special exhibits during major international industry gatherings, such as the NAB Show and IBC. </p>
			<p>8K UHD is the pinnacle of the TV viewing experience. From a resolution point of view, it creates pictures with four times more pixels than 4K UHD (7,680 x 4,320 pixels vs. 3,840 x 2.160 pixels, or 33 million pixels vs. 8 million) and 16 times more than HDTV. </p>
			<p>Both 4K and 8K present video with High Dynamic Range (HDR); HDTV as broadcast does not. They also offer a wider color gamut than broadcast HDTV (ITU-R Rec. 2100 vs. ITU Rec. 709). While these qualities taken together deliver the highest visual TV experience to viewers, 8K&rsquo;s 22.2 multichannel sound system extends the system&rsquo;s superior quality to the aural arena.</p>
			<p>Millions of viewers in Japan have the opportunity to enjoy NHK&rsquo;s 4K and 8K coverage. According to Statista Research, there were about 8.8 million Japanese households that owned a 4K or 8K UHD TV as of fiscal year 2019, a figure the research firm forecasted to grow beyond 16 million this year.</p>
			<p>An NHK spokesperson declined to provide details about specific 8K production technology to be used for its 8K coverage. However, the broadcaster previously has deployed an 8K camera system of its own design for major sporting events, debuting its use for coverage of the Rugby World Cup in 2018.</p>
			<p>NHK&rsquo;s 8K UHDTV coverage of the 2021 Summer Olympics will only be available to viewers in Japan.</p>
			<p>The 2021 Summer Olympics from Tokyo run from Friday, July 23, to Sunday, Aug. 8. The 2021 Paralympics are scheduled for Tuesday, Aug. 24 to Sunday, Sept. 5.</p>
			<p>In the U.S., NBC will begin live coverage of the Opening Ceremony at 6:55 a.m. EDT and re-air the opening at 7:30 p.m. EDT.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/300361477/rocket-lab-investigation-uncovers-cause-of-failed-launch-from-mhia-peninsula-and-prepares-for-july-mission<br>
			</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab says it has concluded an extensive review into the cause of a failed mission launch on May 15 from its facility on M&#x0101;hia Peninsula.</p>
			<p>The root cause of the issue that resulted in the loss of &ldquo;Running Out Of Toes&rdquo; had been identified and corrective measures were now in place, the company said in a statement.</p>
			<p>The rocket, which was carrying two Earth-observation satellites for BlackSky, a global monitoring company, would be back on the pad for the next mission later this month.</p>
			<p>The company did not give details about the next Electron mission but said more information would be made available in the coming days.</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab has completed an anomaly review into a failed launch and says its next mission will be this month.</p>
			<p>An internal review, with oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), concluded that an issue occurred within the second stage engine igniter system &#150; almost three minutes and 20 seconds into the flight.</p>
			<p>A corruption of signals within the engine computer caused &ldquo;the Rutherford engine&rsquo;s thrust vector control (TVC) to deviate outside nominal parameters&rdquo; and resulted in the engine computer commanding zero pump speed, shutting down the engine.</p>
			<p>The fault resulted from a previously undetectable failure mode within the ignition system that occurs under a unique set of environmental pressures and conditions, the statement said.</p>
			<p>The issue was not evident during extensive pre-flight testing for the mission, including more than 400 seconds of burn for that particular engine.</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab had since been able to reliably replicate the issue in testing and had implemented redundancies in the ignition system to prevent any future reoccurrence, including modifications to the igniter&rsquo;s design and manufacture, the statement said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The anomaly review confirmed that Electron&rsquo;s first stage performed flawlessly during the mission and did not contribute to the flight issue. As a result, Rocket Lab was able to conduct a successful re-entry, ocean splashdown and recovery of the first stage as planned, marking a major milestone in the company&rsquo;s program to make Electron a reusable launch vehicle.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The FAA confirmed in June that Rocket Lab&rsquo;s launch licence remained active. <br>

					</i></b><br>

			</p>
			<p>The control station at the McMurdo research facility in Antarctica. Scientists are pushing for a reliable internet connection. William Sutton/DanitaDelimont.com &quot;Danita Delimont Photography&quot;/Newscom</p>
			<p>Nestled at the southern tip of Ross Island, just off the Antarctic coast, lies one of the most remote towns in the world. McMurdo Station is the main U.S. outpost in Antarctica, built on an outcropping of rugged volcanic rock.</p>
			<p>McMurdo Station has no permanent residents &#151; just a revolving door of visiting scientists and temporary personnel, some of whom live there for up to a year at a time. At its most populous, typically during the summer, it houses about 1,000 people.</p>
			<p>Their only connection to the outside world comes in the form of satellite systems, which provide limited and fragile access to the internet. That means hundreds of people share a slow and intermittent internet connection.</p>
			<p>Now, scientists hope to bring Antarctica into the 21st century. They&rsquo;re pushing for a fiber optic cable &#151; the fastest form of internet technology &#151; that would extend from New Zealand or Australia all the way down to McMurdo Station.</p>
			<p>The idea has been floating around for years, according to Peter Neff, a glaciologist at the University of Minnesota. But it&rsquo;s recently begun to gain traction again.</p>
			<p>The National Science Foundation sponsored a three-day workshop last month to examine the value such a cable could bring to Antarctica. The workshop featured speakers from research institutions across the U.S., as well as New Zealand and Australia.</p>
			<p>Workshop organizers, including Neff, are working on a summary report that they hope to submit to NSF later this month. Meanwhile, the agency is planning to start work on its own &ldquo;desktop studies&rdquo; &#151; compiling research and data on what would be required to make the cable a reality &#151; as early as next month.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time NSF has explored the idea. It came up in the past, only to lose steam. But interest has recently reignited in part because a series of cable projects underway in New Zealand could make it easier for the U.S. to begin work on its own cable construction in the near future.</p>
			<p>At the same time, interest in improving scientific capabilities in Antarctica &#151; where climate change is already having a profound effect &#151; is at an all-time high.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It seems like right now there&rsquo;s an opportunity that&rsquo;s really lit a fire under NSF,&rdquo; Neff said in an interview with E&amp;E News. &ldquo;That if they are able to do this, now is the time.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&lsquo;Starved of bandwidth&rsquo;</p>
			<p>In a typical summer, McMurdo Station hosts a flurry of activity. Scientists of every description &#151; biologists, meteorologists, oceanographers and glaciologists &#151; arrive to carry out research projects at the station&rsquo;s facilities or at nearby field camps.</p>
			<p>These efforts are growing more significant every year. Climate change is swiftly reshaping the Antarctic ice sheet in ways that could profoundly affect human societies all over the world. Antarctica is currently losing hundreds of billions of tons of ice each year, raising global sea levels in the process.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We do know that sea level will continue to rise faster in the future,&rdquo; said Helen Fricker, a glaciologist at University of California. San Diego&rsquo;s Scripps Institution of Oceanography, speaking at the NSF workshop. &ldquo;But our projections are conservative because we really don&rsquo;t understand the processes that are leading to this mass loss all around Antarctica.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Fully understanding the drivers of ice loss in Antarctica is key to making better predictions about sea-level rise. That means more data is needed.</p>
			<p>But high volumes of data pose a challenge for scientists at McMurdo. The limited bandwidth means there&rsquo;s only so much material they can transmit back to the U.S. Often, researchers are unable to fully analyze their data until they lug it home to their labs on hard drives.</p>
			<p>That&rsquo;s a drag on the scientific process. It means important findings could go months before being detected. It can also cause problems for researchers out in the field.</p>
			<p>Antarctic research often relies on measurements collected by sensitive scientific instruments. If something goes wrong &#151; perhaps an instrument needs to be repaired or adjusted in some way &#151; scientists may not realize it until they begin processing their data. By the time they&rsquo;re able to transmit enough data home to their colleagues by satellite, then wait to receive a response, it can be too late.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The main message that I want to leave you with is our community is starved of bandwidth out of Antarctica,&rdquo; said David Bromwich, a polar meteorologist at Ohio State University, at the workshop. &ldquo;The capability does not exist for getting time-critical, large &#151; and large is the emphasis &#151; datasets off the ice.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>A fiber optic cable could transform both research and daily life at McMurdo Station, experts say.</p>
			<p>Nonscientists working at McMurdo, who often are given lower priority when it comes to the internet, could have better connections. Daily operations and cybersecurity efforts would be easier to carry out. Improved video streaming could open up opportunities for scientific education and outreach efforts.</p>
			<p>And scientists could send and receive more data at much higher speeds.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re running a small town, and it exists to support our science,&rdquo; said Patrick Smith, manager of technology development and polar research support at the NSF, in an interview with E&amp;E News. &ldquo;This would be like trying to run the international space station and crippling it by not giving it what it means to properly function to support these science missions that they run on it.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>There are opportunities beyond just better internet. It&rsquo;s now possible to outfit fiber optic cables with special sensors that can collect information about ocean temperature, salinity and other scientific data. These measurements could give scientists even more information about the warming Antarctic coastline.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Any more observations are key,&rdquo; Neff said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re appreciating more and more that every time we think some little detail doesn&rsquo;t matter to the future of Antarctica, it turns out it does, and we always need a long time series for information to evaluate: Is what we&rsquo;re seeing today really exceptional and really out of the norm?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&lsquo;A broader suite of tools&rsquo;</p>
			<p>Five hundred miles from McMurdo Station, a small cluster of buildings stands lonely sentinel at the geographic bottom of the world. The South Pole Station is an outpost even more isolated than McMurdo, home to only about 150 people in a typical summer and just a few dozen during the cold season. From February through November, the Antarctic winter, it&rsquo;s all but inaccessible to outsiders &#151; too cold even for aircraft to reach.</p>
			<p>Secluded in one of the Earth&rsquo;s harshest environments, scientists are able to conduct research that would be impossible almost anywhere else.</p>
			<p>The South Pole Atmospheric Research Observatory maintains one of the world&rsquo;s longest continuous sets of meteorological data from interior Antarctica. It monitors the atmospheric chemistry of some of the cleanest air in the world. Meanwhile, the unique atmosphere at the South Pole allows astrophysicists to detect elusive subatomic particles called neutrinos, research that can give them clues about the origins and the future of the universe.</p>
			<p>These studies collect several terabytes of data each day &#151; and they&rsquo;re in the process of expanding, according to Nathan Whitehorn, a physicist at Michigan State University. Within a decade or so, he said, South Pole physicists will likely be collecting even more data than the famous Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the world&rsquo;s most powerful particle accelerator.</p>
			<p>But satellite signal at the South Pole Station is even more precarious than it is elsewhere. Typically, it gets a burst of signal for just a few hours a day. South Pole researchers are generally able to transmit only about 10% of their data home &#151; the rest must be shipped on hard drives.</p>
			<p>Because the station is inaccessible for so much of the year, scientists typically ship all their hard drives just once a year &#151; when aircraft are able to come through.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You build up data until November, stick things on an airplane, keep a backup copy in case something happens with the shipment on the airplane &#151; and then a month or so later, it arrives back in the U.S.,&rdquo; Whitehorn said.</p>
			<p>Now, South Pole researchers are hoping that a cable to McMurdo can help them with their own data problem. If the two stations could somehow be connected &#151; perhaps by laying a second cable across the ice &#151; then South Pole scientists could also transmit much larger volumes of data back to their home labs.</p>
			<p>Even in the absence of a second cable, it&rsquo;s easier to transmit data by satellite from South Pole to McMurdo than it is from South Pole to New Zealand or Australia, the next closest data hubs, Whitehorn said. From there, the data could be quickly sent on by cable.</p>
			<p>South Pole scientists aren&rsquo;t the only ones dreaming big. Other Antarctic scientists imagine McMurdo becoming a kind of central data hub for research sites all along the Ross Sea &#151; and potentially farther out across Antarctica.</p>
			<p>The idea is especially dear to ice experts, said Matthew Siegfried, a glaciologist at the Colorado School of Mines, at the workshop. To really understand what&rsquo;s happening to the Antarctic ice sheet, scientists need to collect data from sites all across the continent.</p>
			<p>The types of instruments glaciologists use in the field can collect huge volumes of data, some of them on the order of gigabytes per minute. In an ideal world, McMurdo could serve as a data center for more remote field sites, Siegfried suggested.</p>
			<p>That still leaves the question of how those field sites would be connected to McMurdo. But a reliable signal at McMurdo could at least open the door for connections to other sites down the road.</p>
			<p>Any future cable to McMurdo &ldquo;really needs to be thought of as part of a broader suite of tools to help transform our science,&rdquo; Siegfried said.</p>
			<p>Next steps</p>
			<p>The concept of a McMurdo cable has been floating around at the NSF for at least a decade, according to Smith, the NSF technology development manager. At the time, NSF commissioned a study from a subsea cable consultancy, which suggested that &ldquo;theoretically it could be possible &#151; but there&rsquo;s lots and lots of details you&rsquo;d have to work out,&rdquo; Smith said.</p>
			<p>The idea lost momentum as other projects took priority. But interest resurfaced again last year, when the government of Chile announced its own transoceanic cable project, stretching from South America to New Zealand and Australia. More recently, New Zealand announced plans for its first hyperscale data center to be constructed at the tip of the nation&rsquo;s South Island &#151; a site the NSF had considered for a cable landing of its own.</p>
			<p>These kinds of projects could potentially make it easier for the U.S. to start work on its cable. If multiple parties are interested in building out the infrastructure for a cable landing in the same place, it&rsquo;s often economical for them to team up and share costs.</p>
			<p>With the cable idea back in circulation, NSF is working quickly to figure out if it&rsquo;s actually feasible. The icy Antarctic coastline isn&rsquo;t exactly the easiest place to install a fiber optic cable &#151; lots of research is still needed on how to make it happen and whether it&rsquo;s worth the cost.</p>
			<p>For now, scientists involved in the recent workshop are busy compiling a report for NSF outlining the implications for Antarctic research. In the meantime, NSF is planning to commission a study on the engineering requirements a cable would call for, potentially with the assistance of other federal agencies.</p>
			<p>The study could begin as early as August, according to Smith. Its results will determine whether NSF continues moving forward with the project. If it does, it could still take several years to get a cable installed.</p>

			<p><b><i>NT exits satellite orbital slot auction<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2151015/nt-exits-satellite-orbital-slot-auction<br>
			</p>
			<p>National Telecom (NT) does not plan on participating in the auction of satellite orbital slot packages slated for Aug 28 as it lacks interest in satellite investment, according to Digital Economy and Society (DES) Minister Chaiwut Thanakamanusorn.</p>
			<p>Mr Chaiwut was told the decision by the NT board chairman.</p>
			<p>NT is not keen on investing in the satellite business and the company is focusing on the 5G business through the 700-megahertz range, he said.</p>
			<p>NT was formed by a merger between TOT and CAT Telecom, both state telecom enterprises, in January this year.</p>
			<p>In the 5G spectrum auction last year, CAT Telecom won 20MHz of bandwidth on the 700MHz range, worth 34.3 billion baht. TOT secured 200MHz of bandwidth on the 26- gigahertz range.</p>
			<p>Those spectrum ranges are now owned by NT, which must make use of them for the 5G business.</p>
			<p>NT is figuring out a 5G strategy to generate a revenue stream for the company.</p>
			<p>There are four orbital slot packages up for auction by the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC).</p>
			<p>The first consists of 50.5&deg;East and 51&deg;E slots with a reserve price of 677 million baht; the second is 78.5&deg;E with a reserve price of 366.4 million; the third involves 119.5&deg;E and 120&deg;E with a reserve price of 393 million; and the last is for 126&deg;E and 142&deg;E with a reserve price of 364.6 million.</p>
			<p>Mr Chaiwut made it clear it is not necessary that all the slots be put up for auction.</p>
			<p>&quot;Some orbital slots should be kept for national security purposes, while others can be reallocated via the auction,&quot; he said.</p>
			<p>Mr Chaiwut said he has not discussed this point with the NBTC.</p>
			<p>The NBTC previously planned to hold the satellite orbital slot auction on July 24, but on July 7 the board postponed the event until Aug 28 after only one firm -- TC Space Connect, a subsidiary of SET-listed satellite service provider Thaicom -- picked up a bid packet.</p>
			<p>Mu Space and Advanced Technology, a local satellite and space tech firm, bought a bid envelope in May, but failed to submit a bid request by the deadline on July 5.</p>
			<p>The NBTC is allowing interested parties a new opportunity to buy a bid envelope until Aug 6.</p>
			<p>New bidders are allowed to submit their requests and place a bank guarantee by Aug 11.</p>
			<p>The list of qualified bidders who have experience and pass the financial capability checks is scheduled to be announced on Aug 24, while an information session and mock auction are slated for Aug 25.</p>
			<p>Mr Chaiwut suggested earlier the NBTC postpone the auction until new NBTC board members take office, saying the bidding requires prudent consideration to ensure optimum benefit for the country.<br>

			<p>China successfully sent a new remote-sensing satellite group into orbit from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province on Monday morning.</p>
			<p>The 10th group of the Yaogan-30 family, the satellites were launched aboard a Long March-2C carrier rocket at 8:19 a.m.</p>
			<p>The satellites will carry out electromagnetic environment detection and relevant technological verification in a multi-satellite network, according to China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).</p>
			<p>The Tianqi-15, a satellite of the Tianqi constellation, was also aboard the rocket. It is mainly for data collection for the Internet of Things, the CASC said.</p>

			<p>Developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology under the CASC, the Long March-2C rocket is a liquid-fueled launch vehicle with a total length of 43 meters. It has a takeoff mass of 242 tonnes and can lift up to 2 tonnes to a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 500 kilometers.</p>
			<p>&quot;The Long March-2C rocket had sent all the 10 groups of the Yaogan-30 satellites into the preset orbit with high precision in the four years since the launch of the first group in 2017,&quot; said Xing Jianwei, vice chief designer of the Long March-2C rocket.</p>
			<p>The 100-percent success rate of the launches demonstrates the rocket's high reliability, Xing added.</p>
			<p>The launch was the 77th flight mission of the Long March-2C rockets and the 380th of the Long March rocket series.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/19/ses-vs-intelsat-nears-summary-judgement/<br>
			</p>
			<p>SES has filed various Motions in front of Intelsat&rsquo;s bankruptcy court ahead of a planned hearing on the SES application for a summary judgement in its case for a 50/50 split of the FCC&rsquo;s incentive payments. The FCC payments are in respect of the C-band reallocation over the US.</p>
			<p>Some of the key elements in the Motions are redacted and placed under the court&rsquo;s seal but include a 22-page document (Exhibit 158) submitted to the FCC in October 2017 by Intelsat and Intel. Another, also filed under seal, is an email from Intelsat&rsquo;s VP/Communications Dianne VanBeber dated November 18th 2019.</p>
			<p>However, a 45-page document from SES&rsquo;s lawyers argues &#150; again &#150; the key elements from the SES point of view which is that the two litigants were &ldquo;equal parties&rdquo; and laboured together for more than a year in pursuit of their joint goals [with the FCC] for an equal share of the FCC&rsquo;s $9.7 billion in incentive payments.</p>
			<p>SES alleges (in a much-redacted document) an &ldquo;about face&rdquo; by Intelsat which was &ldquo;flatly contrary&rdquo; to the parties&rsquo; agreement which called for the 50/50 split of FCC payments. Intelsat, in its counter argument has said that they would have &ldquo;walked away&rdquo; from the agreement and &ldquo;ceasing their cooperative efforts to monetise their C-Band rights and ceding operational control of the C-Band transition process.&rdquo; They would just give up, alleges SES.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This after-the-fact story is implausible on its face and directly contradicted by the terms of the Agreement, its basic purpose of advancing the parties&rsquo; mutual interest in transitioning their C-Band services in a financially beneficial way, and the parties&rsquo; consistent and undisputed course of conduct,&rdquo; says the SES Motion.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Intelsat clearly wishes that it had negotiated for a right to withdraw from the C-Band Alliance in the event of a public auction so that it could keep its higher individual allocation of accelerated relocation payments. But Intelsat cannot point to any language in the Agreement granting such a right, nor would SES have ever agreed to it,&rdquo; says the Motion.</p>
			<p>The SES application, in essence, is that if a Summary decision is reached then it should be in favour of SES, or else &ldquo;a trial on the merits [of the case] is warranted.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, a 57-page counter-Motion from Intelsat, also filed on July 16th, argues their key points which include a claim that Punitive Damages are not available for breaches of fiduciary duty in this case and that &ldquo;no reasonable fact-finder would award punitive damages here&rdquo;. Intelsat rebut the SES claims saying the SES arguments are meritless and should be denied. Intelsat says: &ldquo;SES offers a 75-page infomercial presenting its spin on the events surrounding the FCC&rsquo;s decision to reject the approach for which the C-Band Alliance (CBA), Intelsat, and SES advocated. In the process, SES ignores the contract and backtracks from its prior, unequivocal statements confirming that if the FCC rejected the CBA&rsquo;s market-based approach (which it did), the CBA would disband.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The hearing is currently scheduled for August 19th.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Malaysia&rsquo;s Measat-3, still uncontrollably drifting westward in the geostationary arc, remains under continuous telemetry despite its anomaly. Boeing is investigating what might be the root cause of the problem which occurred on June 21st.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, almost all of its broadcast channels and customers have been reassigned capacity on other Measat or third-party satellites.</p>
			<p>Specialist space monitoring company ExoAnalytic Solutions reportedly suggest that the satellite appears to have made various attempts correct its situation. Various news reports say the craft is now tumbling in orbit.</p>
			<p>A statement on July 17th from Measat said: &ldquo;All the Measat-3 transponders have been deactivated to prevent interference with other satellites. Measat has also informed Combined Space Operations Centre (CSpOC) via Space-Track to track the Measat-3 satellite and notify other operators of the satellite&rsquo;s orbital location, while the full investigation is being conducted by Measat and Boeing. A report on the outcome of the investigation will be released in due course&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Measat-3 was due to be replaced next year with Measat-3D currently under construction by Airbus.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/19/cnn-to-debut-in-q1-2022/<br>
			</p>
			<p>CNN+, the much-anticipated streaming subscription service from CNN, will debut in Q1 2022, expanding CNN&rsquo;s multiplatform global reach to provide a new, additive experience that complements the core CNN linear networks and digital platforms to serve CNN superfans, news junkies and fans of quality non-fiction programming.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;CNN invented cable news in 1980, defined online news in 1995 and now is taking an important step in expanding what news can be by launching a direct-to-consumer streaming subscription service in 2022,&rdquo; said Jeff Zucker, Chairman of WarnerMedia News and Sports and President of CNN Worldwide. &ldquo;As the most trusted and recognised name in news, CNN has unrivaled global reach, world class talent and a deep existing library of content including award-winning series and films. On top of a television offering that has never been stronger, which remains at the core of what we do today, we will offer consumers a streaming product that grows the reach and scope of the CNN brand in a way that no one else is doing. Nothing like this exists.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>CNN+ will feature original, live, on demand and interactive programming as a standalone direct-to-consumer service with offerings that are separate and distinct from CNN, CNN International, HLN and CNN en Espa&ntilde;ol linear TV channels. At launch, eight to 12 hours of live, daily programming offering topical deep dives and lifestyle content from some of CNN&rsquo;s most prominent talent, as well as several new faces, will live alongside a thriving community component for fans to connect directly with anchors and experts in real time conversations about the issues that matter most to them.</p>
			<p>CNN+ will launch with a deep library of non-fiction, long form programming including past seasons of CNN&rsquo;s original series and films, including Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown, Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy, This is Life with Lisa Ling, and United Shades of America with W. Kamau Bell.</p>
			<p>Additionally, CNN+ will build upon that library with new original series and films developed for CNN+, which will be unveiled later this year.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;For 41-years, global audiences have turned to CNN as an essential source of news and information, which is rooted in our deep commitment to quality journalism,&rdquo; noted Andrew Morse, CNN Worldwide Chief Digital Officer. &ldquo;CNN+ will be built on a foundation of world class reporting and storytelling and a commitment to meet our audiences wherever they are.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>CNN will continue to have a single app where CNN+ subscribers can access CNN+ programming and pay TV subscribers can get the TVE experience they have enjoyed for many years. The app will include CNN&rsquo;s linear TV feeds of CNN, CNN International, HLN and CNN en Espa&ntilde;ol channels, which will be available exclusively for pay TV subscribers. If pay-TV subscribers choose to maximise their experience, they can also subscribe to CNN+ to access the full CNN+ programming all in one place.</p>
			<p>CNN&rsquo;s #1 digital news platform, in CNN.com and CNN mobile apps, will remain a separate, free offering serving news consumers around the globe with trusted journalism and information.</p>
			<p>The leadership of CNN+ includes:<br>
				&bull;Andrew Morse, chief digital officer for CNN Worldwide, is the executive in charge of CNN+, with oversight of the content, product development and business operations of the platform.<br>
				&bull;Alex MacCallum, CNN Worldwide&rsquo;s head of product is the general manager of CNN+, with oversight of product development, customer acquisition and marketing, strategy and growth and revenue operations.<br>
				&bull;Rebecca Kutler, senior vice president and head of programming for CNN+, is overseeing the development, production and programming of live and taped programs for CNN+.<br>
				&bull;Courtney Coupe, senior vice president of content strategy and operations for CNN+, is overseeing the strategy, curation and programming of content on CNN+, as well as community management.<br>
				&bull;Robyn Peterson, CNN Worldwide&rsquo;s chief technology officer, is overseeing the team of technologists and engineers developing a world class platform and user experience for CNN+.</p>
			<p>CNN&rsquo;s Original Series and Films unit, led by CNN Worldwide executive vice president for talent and content development, Amy Entelis, is developing new series and films for the platform. Vice president of programme development Katie Hinman will lead the development and production of external series for CNN+, working with Jon Adler, vice president of programme development for CNN Original Series.</p>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/15/measat-3-satellite-lost/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Malaysia&rsquo;s Measat-3 satellite is believed to be a total loss and is drifting in an uncontrolled orbit through the geostationary arc. It might now be a &lsquo;zombie satellite&rsquo; and start causing problems for other satellites in its path.</p>
			<p>Its nominal position was at 91.5 degrees East. It is already at 86.4 degrees East on July 10th and drifting at 0.3 degrees per day.</p>
			<p>The loss has also caused severe headaches for its clients; Astro DTH, for example, suffered transponder outages around June 21st and subsequently moved channels to other Measat satellites.</p>
			<p>Measat-3 is a Boeing 601 craft launched in December 2006 and was due to be replaced with Measat-3D in 2022. As recently as June 27th Measat said there were still problems and that it needed more time to restore full services.</p>
			<p>Satellites in its path include Russia&rsquo;s Express 80, Thaicom 6 and 8, Apstar 7, ABS 2 and 2A, and a few Intelsat craft ( I-22, I-20, I-36 and I-17). Eutelsat 70B is also a potential problem at 70.5 degrees East.</p>
			<p>Each of these craft will have the ability to manoeuvre out of harm&rsquo;s way and the offending craft is being very closely monitored for any changes in its trajectory.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
			</p>
			<p>(Craig's comment, I made a tweet back on July 5th saying it had gone walkabout and it was well out of the official orbital slot...no response from @measat......)<br>

			</p>
			<p>SES has signed a three-year capacity deal with iSAT Africa to provide 4G mobile service in East Africa via the O3b mPOWER satellite constellation. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed in the July 15 announcement. </p>
			<p>iSAT Africa is among the first companies in Africa to sign up for O3b mPOWER. This new service will first be available through SES&rsquo;s O3b Medium-Earth Orbit (MEO) constellation and will subsequently migrate to O3b mPOWER in 2022. According to SES, this connectivity will allow iSAT Africa to quickly scale its network to meet anticipated  connectivity demands, and it will allow local mobile operators to deploy 4G services to close the digital divide</p>
			<p>&ldquo;At iSAT Africa, we don&rsquo;t just believe in delivering connectivity to everyone across Africa.

			<p><b><i>Starlink to improve latency for competitive online gaming, Musk says<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://mashable.com/article/starlink-latency-improves-online-gaming<br>
			</p>
			<p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk plans to reduce the latency on Starlink, the company's satellite internet network, to under 20 milliseconds.</p>
			<p>Starlink will soon be able to support competitive online gaming, thanks to upcoming latency enhancements, according to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.  </p>
			<p>Musk made the statement on Twitter while discussing his company&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to improve Starlink, the company&rsquo;s satellite internet network. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;Ping should improve dramatically in coming months. We&rsquo;re aiming for &lt;20ms. Basically, you should be able to play competitive FPS (first-person shooter) games through Starlink,&rdquo; he wrote in the tweet. </p>
			<p>Currently, the latencies for SpaceX&rsquo;s satellite internet network can range from over 20 milliseconds to as high as 88ms. As a result, you can already game over Starlink, but you may encounter significant lag during an online first-person shooter session, depending on the connection quality.</p>
			<p>The company&rsquo;s goal is to reduce the latencies to under 20ms later this year. To pull this off, Musk said SpaceX is working to establish more Starlink ground stations across the globe. These ground stations are connected to local fiber networks and beam the internet data to the Starlink satellites in orbit.</p>
			<p>In addition, the company is working to streamline the internet packet routing across the network. &ldquo;More ground stations &amp; less foolish packet routing will make the biggest differences,&rdquo; Musk wrote in a follow-up tweet. </p>
			<p>According to Musk, theoretically Starlink should only need 10 milliseconds to route the internet data, if all the impediments can be removed. &ldquo;Looking at speed of light as ~300km per millisecond &amp; satellite altitude of ~550km, average photon round-trip time is only ~10ms, so a lot of silly things have to happen to drive ping &gt;20ms,&rdquo; he added. </p>
			<p>To further drive down the latency, SpaceX has been incorporating built-in lasers on the newest Starlink satellites to transmit data from one satellite to the next &#151;all while in orbit. The company has previously said the lasers can &ldquo;transfer hundreds of gigabytes of data&rdquo; between the satellites. </p>
			<p>On Wednesday, Musk added: &ldquo;Laser links in orbit can reduce long-distance latency by as much as 50%, due to higher speed of light in vacuum and shorter path than undersea fiber.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The lasers might also make it possible for Starlink satellites to serve the internet data to users without fetching the information from ground stations on Earth. &ldquo;Some traffic could just go terminal -&gt; satellite -&gt; satellite -&gt; terminal and never touch the regular Internet,&rdquo; Musk said. </p>
			<p>SpaceX&rsquo;s other major goal for this year is to double the download speeds for Starlink to 300Mbps. To achieve the faster speeds, the company has been launching new batches of Starlink satellites in orbit usually every few weeks. </p>
			<p>To sign up for Starlink, you can go to the company&rsquo;s official website. The service costs $99 a month, along with a $499 one-time fee for the equipment. However, it's mainly targeting users based in rural and remote regions.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Content protection and multiscreen television solutions provider NAGRA has declared it is proud to be working with Latin American anti-piracy association Alianza once again in leveraging its anti-piracy capabilities to bring down criminal activity in Brazil as part of Opera&ccedil;&atilde;o 404 (Operation 404), a partnership spanning local, regional, public and private organisations in many countries.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;With the third phase of Operation 404 now underway, NAGRA &#150; on behalf of Alianza &#150; is continuing to play an important role in providing its industry and legal expertise and solutions to support the ongoing efforts and persistence of Brazilian government authorities, law enforcement and other agencies in taking down pirate organisations,&rdquo; asserts Pascal M&eacute;tral, VP of Legal Affairs and Head of Anti-Piracy Intelligence, Investigations and Litigation, NAGRA.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Operation 404 is an important, multi-jurisdictional effort designed to curb digital pirates throughout Brazil, a country where consumption of pirated local and international content remains massive and very impactful for the entertainment and media industry,&rdquo; he notes.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The first phase of the programme, carried out in 2019, featured more than 300 takedowns, including 210 illegal websites and 100 illegal applications,&rdquo; he reports. &ldquo;The second phase, which took place last year, resulted in a total of 25 judicial search and seizure warrants across ten Brazilian states, as well as 252 websites and 65 streaming applications, reaching more than 26 million users, being blocked or suspended. This third phase addressed 334 pirate websites and 94 pirate streaming applications. These repeated efforts by law enforcement and the industry are certainly contributing to mitigate audiovisual piracy in Brazil,&rdquo; he concludes .<br>

			</p>
			<p>Samsung has announced a deal with Shorts International to launch a number of free-to-view advertising supported short film channels on Samsung TV Plus.</p>
			<p>The channels will initially launch in the UK, Italy and Spain.</p>
			<p>Shorts International said that the deal represents a relaunch of its Shorts brand, with the new channels (called Shorts in the UK and Italy, and Cortos in Spain) offering a range of high-quality international short films and local content.</p>
			<p>Highlighted shorts include the Academy Award winning Six Shooter, by Martin McDonagh, starring Brendan Gleeson, BAFTA winning Pitch Black Heist, starring Michael Fassbender, and the Spanish Goya winning animation Blue and Malone.</p>
			<p>ShortsTV CEO and Founder Carter Pilcher said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled to announce this partnership, to bring anyone who owns a Samsung Smart TV or Galaxy device in the UK, Italy and Spain a taste of the world&rsquo;s best short films. This marks the relaunch of the popular Shorts brand, which was previously enjoyed by viewers in the US and Europe, deployed in a new format that gives viewers an entr&eacute;e to the ShortsTV experience. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is a big step for us &#150; until now, we&rsquo;ve only made this world-leading catalogue of films available to paying TV subscribers, but the demand for the world&rsquo;s best short films and short series is just too big to ignore. Viewers will sample some of the world&rsquo;s biggest national and international stars in unforgettable short films they will want to watch over and over.&rdquo;<br>

			</p>
			<p>Exclusive: Seven, Optus &amp; Fetch abandon a previously-announced 4K Olympics channel.</p>
			<p>EXCLUSIVE: Optus has dropped plans to screen the Tokyo Olympics in 4K Ultra HD.</p>
			<p>In December 2019 the telco announced plans for a channel featuring Seven&rsquo;s coverage of Tokyo 2020 in 4K Ultra HD, available to Optus 5G Home customers via Fetch.</p>
			<p>The announcement was made by Seven West Media Chief Revenue Officer, Kurt Burnette, Optus VP Product Development, TV and Content, Clive Dickens -formerly Chief Digital Officer at Seven- and Fetch CEO, Scott Lorson.</p>
			<p>An Optus spokesperson told TV Tonight, &ldquo;With the postponement of the Olympics to 2021, Seven, Optus and Fetch mutually decided last year to not pursue this opportunity, focussing our efforts and investment in becoming a proud partner of their exclusive HD and streaming coverage across Channel 7 and 7plus.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Seven will screen 45 dedicated Olympic channels across Seven and 7plus Live in HD -but there is now no 4K offer in 2021.<br>

			</p>
			<p>F1 TV Pro incudes frills such as the ability to switch between first-person camera mounted on each of the cars. Image / F1 TV</p>
			<p>From today, Kiwis have access to F1 TV Pro, the official Formula 1 streaming service that's previously been geo-blocked to people in New Zealand.</p>
			<p>F1 Pro TV offers frills including a multi-screen display and the ability to hop between different &quot;channels&quot; to see the view from one of 20 onboard cameras mounted on different cars for first-person view of what it's like to race at 320km/h.</p>
			<p>There are two ways to get F1 Pro TV.</p>
			<p>Those who subscribe to Spark Sport - which has been carrying coverage of F1 races since it launched in 2019 - will get F1 Pro TV thrown in for free (after activating their complementary sub by going to f1tv.formula1.com and clicking &quot;Activate and Sync My Account&quot;; Spark has also posted instructions at help.sparksport.co.nz.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, Kiwis can sign up directly to F1 Pro TV via the streaming service's website, where New Zealanders can now get a monthly pass for $14.99 or an annual pass for $99.99.</p>
			<p>A Spark Sport spokesman refused to say if the telco got any clip of the ticket when a Kiwi customer subscribed directly to F1 TV Pro, saying &quot;That is commercially sensitive information.&quot;</p>
			<p>The spokesman added that those who took the Spark Sport option would get access to the streaming service's full range of sport, including cricket and English Premier League football, while those who subscribed to F1 TV Pro directly would not get access to Formula 2 or Formula 3 - to which Spark Sport maintains exclusive rights.</p>
			<p>F1 TV is owned by Liberty Media, the US conglomerate that also owns the F1 competition.</p>
			<p>The services it offers vary by country. Kiwis get F1 TV Access and Race Replay (that is basic live and on-demand coverage of races, as Spark Sport has been carrying) plus F1 Pro TV).</p>
			<p>Unlike Spark Sport, F1 TV Pro does not have any smart TV support. Neither does it have Apple TV support. Its app is supported by Chromecast, and recent Apple and Android phones and tablets (a full list is here).</p>
			<p>The rise of direct-to-the-consumer streaming services is complicating life for local broadcasters, and local streaming services, worldwide.</p>
			<p>On the entertainment side of things, Sky TV (and most of its peers around the world) lost its Disney channels as the Mouse House pulled back rights so its new Disney+ streaming service could be the exclusive home of most of its content.</p>
			<p>Sky also lost exclusive rights to Discovery content, paving the way for the launch of Discovery+ in NZ.</p>
			<p>And in sports, Sky's new deal with ESPN (majority-owned by Disney) also gives Sky subscribers access to content from the global sports giant via its ESPN+ app.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Spark Sport will be keeping an eye on the English Premier League's putative plan - interrupted by the pandemic, for the meantime - to create a global &quot;Netflix of football&quot; in the manner already established by the major US sporting codes.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.space.com/sentinel-6-satellite-tracking-earth-sea-level-rise<br>
			</p>
			<p>The world's newest ocean-watcher is now live.</p>
			<p>The new European-American ocean-monitoring satellite Sentinel 6 Michael Freilich has started delivering ultra-precise measurements of rising sea levels on Earth a six-month shakedown period. </p>
			<p>As the globe's climate changes, Earth's oceans are warming and rising. To keep a watch on the waters, scientists have been relying for three decades on eyes in the sky: satellites that closely track how seas are behaving around the world. And the latest such satellite, Sentinel 6 Michael Freilich, has just begun to send back data. </p>
			<p>The spacecraft, named after the late NASA climate scientist Michael Freilich, lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California last November. In time, Sentinel 6 will be able to give scientists more precise data about ocean surfaces than its predecessors, accurate to only a few centimeters. As a result, it'll allow meteorologists to better track weather patterns, such as nascent hurricanes and accurately monitor temperatures and rising sea levels.</p>
			<p>For now, its mission has just begun. &quot;It's a relief knowing that the satellite is working and that the data look good,&quot; said Josh Willis, a project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), in a statement. &quot;Several months from now, Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich will take over for its predecessor, Jason-3, and this data release is the first step in that process.&quot;<br>

			<p>Australia&rsquo;s Seven Network has become the latest broadcaster to sign a distribution deal with all-electric racing series Extreme E.</p>
			<p>The deal will see Seven air the series on its free-to-air network and BVOD platform 7plus. The broadcaster will air one-hour highlights programmes throughout its capital cities including Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, and regional Queensland.</p>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://paxex.aero/panasonic-avionics-apstar-6d-xts-china-activation/<br>
			</p>
			<p>In-flight internet service picked up some speed over China. Panasonic Avionics Corporation (PAC) completed activation of its extreme high throughput (XTS) satellite payload via four teleports in the region, including one in mainland China.</p>
			<p>    China and the Asia Pacific region is a strategically important market for Panasonic Avionics and a key priority in our roadmap for introducing increased satellite capacity. Chinese airlines can now enhance their in-flight experience and brand value by enabling their passengers to enjoy our industry-leading connectivity in the skies.<br>
				    &#150; Jeff Sare, Vice President of In-Flight Connectivity Services at Panasonic Avionics Corporation</p>
			<p>Maturing China Coverage</p>
			<p>PAC reported the APSTAR 6D satellite active in February 2021, increasing capacity across the Asia Pacific region. Bringing the China capacity online required additional integration with a local ground station. With that testing completed and the Beijing teleport online, airlines flying over China can take advantage of the boost in available bandwidth. Other active teleports for the satellite include Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong, and Perth.</p>
			<p>APSTAR 6D provides airlines flying across Asia Pacific with multiple gigahertz of new Ku-band capacity over China, including high-density air traffic routes across East Asia using XTS spot beams. APSTAR delivers 90 beams across the whole region, and 50 Gbps in capacity.<br>
				Growing capacity globally</p>
			<p>Capacity on APSTAR 6D is an integral part of Panasonic Avionics&rsquo; third-generation communications (Gen-3) network of high speed, high bandwidth Ku-band satellites. The network, covering over 99% of all routes, places capacity where it is most needed to meet the growing needs of airlines and their passengers.</p>
			<p>The company plans to activate additional capacity over Russia this month with SES NSS-12 satellite. Further capacity will also be added over the Middle East this autumn on the SES12 HTS satellite.</p>
			<p>The next XTS satellite to join Panasonic Avionics&rsquo; Gen-3 network, Eutelsat 10B, is due to launch next year, entering into service in 2023. It will provide enhanced connectivity to airlines and their passengers flying over Europe and the Middle East.<br>

			<p>Intelsat&rsquo;s newest business division retires Gogo name, reinforces its commitment to provide industry-leading inflight internet</p>
			<p>MCLEAN, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Intelsat announced today that Gogo Commercial Aviation, a business it acquired in December 2020, is dropping the Gogo name and is now called Intelsat.</p>
			<p>    &ldquo;With Intelsat&rsquo;s powerful, integrated offering, airlines no longer need to trade speed, reliability or availability for coverage &#151; even when flying at full capacity in and out of the busiest airports.&rdquo;<br>
			</p>
			<p>With its acquisition of Gogo&rsquo;s Commercial Aviation division, Intelsat became the world&rsquo;s leading provider of inflight broadband connectivity to the commercial aviation industry. The vertical integration is uniquely positioning Intelsat to deliver a reliable, high-performance inflight entertainment and connectivity (IFEC) experience for commercial airlines and their passengers.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Intelsat&rsquo;s unparalleled global reach, depth of capacity and vertical integration provides commercial airlines with unmatched optionality and flexibility, delivering the frictionless IFEC experience essential to commercial airlines,&rdquo; said Intelsat Chief Executive Officer Stephen Spengler. &ldquo;With Intelsat&rsquo;s powerful, integrated offering, airlines no longer need to trade speed, reliability or availability for coverage &#151; even when flying at full capacity in and out of the busiest airports.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Our company is known for its flexibility and commitment to exceptional customer service, and we&rsquo;re always innovating new models aimed at helping airlines identify the right distribution strategy to meet their unique needs,&rdquo; said John Wade, president of Intelsat&rsquo;s commercial aviation business division. &ldquo;We do more than talk a good game; Intelsat&rsquo;s superior customer experience is backed by meaningful and easy-to-understand SLAs that commercial airlines can trust to meet their passenger experience needs today, tomorrow and for decades to come,&ldquo; said Wade.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This name change is happening while Intelsat is leveraging its unparalleled global orbital and spectrum rights, scale and partnerships to build the world&rsquo;s first global 5G satellite-based software-defined network of networks,&rdquo; added Spengler. &ldquo;The Intelsat network will be capable of supporting virtually any access technology, enabling the next generation of global mobility, IoT and 5G services with never-before-seen combined simplicity, coverage, economics and performance.&rdquo; <br>

				From https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2021/07/14/intersputnik-and-rscc-ink-cooperation-deal/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Intersputnik and Russian Satellite Communications Company (RSCC) have signed an agreement on cooperation in using frequency assignments in using orbit and frequency resource.</p>
			<p>RSCC is one of the 25 national Signatories of Intersputnik, which unites 26 member countries from Europe, Asia, Latin America and South-East Asia and offers access to the satellite resources of the Russian constellation.</p>
			<p>Commenting on the agreement, RSCC DG Alexey Volin noted that it offers &ldquo;a new cost-effective solution to RSCC customers willing to have a single-entry point for communications services in any region of the world. It is a well-known fact, that no operator has got 100% coverage of the globe or solid competences in non-geostationary telecommunications systems. The agreement gives us an opportunity to participate in using the orbit and frequency resource according to the model commonly known as VNO. Cooperation under this model allows avoiding substantial capital investment otherwise required to set up and maintain a satellite network for narrow and new market segments and, at the same time, broadens the service capabilities of RSCC as an all-purpose satellite operator&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Intersputnik DG Ksenia Drozdova added: &ldquo;the agreement is interesting because it introduces a totally new business model for cooperation between operators. Strictly in line with the organisation&rsquo;s fundamental documents and following the decisions of the governing bodies, we offered the signatories cooperation in using frequency assignment in geostationary and other orbits to implement projects on the joint use of satellite capacity and to address the needs of both the signatory and the organisation. It is important for us that the satellite resource used by Intersputnik in the signatories&rsquo; available frequency bands according to the agreement on the establishment of the organisation makes up Intersputnik&rsquo;s space segment, which can be used along with Intersputnik&rsquo;s own resource. It is a great honour for Intersputnik that it was RSCC, which has the largest satellite fleet among all our signatories, that became the first operator to sign this innovative agreement. I confess that after transition from RSCC to take a position at Intersputnik I am doubly pleased that we have successfully managed not only to preserve but also to obviously strengthen the good traditions of reliable partnership and mutually enriching cooperation&rdquo;.<br>

			<p><b><i>Luxembourg&rsquo;s SES plans satellite-based quantum encryption service<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.capacitymedia.com/articles/3829100/luxembourgs-ses-plans-satellite-based-quantum-encryption-service<br>
			</p>
			<p>Luxembourg is to build a satellite-based quantum key distribution network in association with its local satellite company, SES.</p>
			<p>The project will see the government of one of the smallest member states of the European Union (EU) work with pan-European bodies to build the Quantum Communications Infrastructure project (LuxQCI), which it hopes will improve cyber security.</p>
			<p>Steve Collar (pictured), CEO of SES, commented: &ldquo;Satellite-enabled cybersecurity is a technology of the future that is being developed now, and is an integral element of reliable quantum communications infrastructures. The safe and intrusion-resistant data exchange mechanisms developed here will serve as a flagship project that can be replicated on a wider European scale.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The idea is to use satellites for quantum key distribution (QKD), seen to be a successor to existing online security systems, using approaches such as secure sockets layer (SSL).</p>
			<p>SES says that LuxQCI &ldquo;will guarantee the security of digital transactions and of confidential information transfer over geographically dispersed areas&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>The project has the backing of the European Space Agency (ESA), which is not part of the EU, as well as the Luxembourg government.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Early users of the infrastructure will be governmental and institutional authorities and business sectors requiring ultra-secure data transmission,&rdquo; said SES. The project &ldquo;will ultimately evolve into a quantum internet, linking quantum processors and sensors and enabling an EU-wide distributed quantum computing and communication capability&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>The project is backed by EuroQCI, an almost EU-wide project to develop a quantum communications infrastructure. It has been signed by 26 of the 27 members of the EU &#150; all but Ireland. (The UK, not being an EU member since 2020, is not eligible.)</p>
			<p>EuroQCI will consist of an earth-based segment that will use existing fibre communication networks linking strategic sites, and a space-based segment ensuring full coverage across the EU and other continents.</p>
			<p>An EU website about EuroQCI says: &ldquo;The aim is for it to be fully operational by 2027.&rdquo; But an SES representative working with LuxQCI was unable to put a date on the Luxembourg project.</p>
			<p>EuroQCI and LuxQCI are not the first satellite-based QKD projects.</p>
			<p>Last month Capacity reported that that CommStar Space Communications, which is working with Lumen, Orange and Equinix, is planning to build a satellite-based QKD network, with the first satellite due to be in service before 2023.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://satelliteprome.com/news/spacecom-extends-deal-with-yes-dth-and-asiasat/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Spacecom has recently secured a $38m extension on a services contract from Israel&rsquo;s government and a $6m contract from a mobile operator in Africa.</p>
			<p>Israeli fleet operator Spacecom has signed a two-year extension deal with DBS Satellite Services, operator of Yes DTH in Israel. The deal, worth USD 14m, will continue the DTH&rsquo;s operations from the Amos-7 and Amos-3 satellites at Spacecom&rsquo;s 4 degrees West orbital hotspot. Furthermore, with this agreement, Yes&rsquo; order backlog increases to $100m.</p>
			<p>The agreement with Yes has an additional two potential extensions of six-months each, starting at the end date of the new agreement. If realised, they will result in an additional $7m of revenue for Spacecom.</p>
			<p>Spacecom has also reported the extension of its lease agreement with Hong Kong-based AsiaSat, the owner of the Amos-7 satellite, for an additional two years until 2024. The annual new and reduced lease fee is $14m.</p>
			<p>Spacecom said it has recently secured a $38m extension of a services contract from Israel&rsquo;s government and a $6m contract from a mobile operator in Africa.</p>
			<p>Commenting on the extension, Dan Zajicek, CEO of Spacecom, said: &ldquo;Signing this two-year extension with Yes allows them to simultaneously use both Amos-3 and Amos-7 and continues the recent positive momentum accelerating Spacecom&rsquo;s development. This includes significant deals such as our investment in Canada&rsquo;s NuRAN Wireless and the approximately $9m extension of services agreement on Amos-3 with Magyar Telekom, from the Deutsche Telekom group.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Hungarian information technology and telecommunications company 4iG Plc. is currently in negotiations to take a majority 51% stake in Spacecom.<br>

			<p><b><i>SVOD goes free on Pluto TV. Samsung TV Plus set free in browsers.<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://nscreenmedia.com/fast-evolution-pluto-tv-samsung-tv-plus/<br>
			</p>
			<p>FAST evolution continues with western sports subscription service RidePass going free ad-supported on Pluto TV. And Samsung chases Pluto TV by unchaining TV Plus from its devices, allowing all with a browser to watch for free.</p>
			<p>SVOD switches to FAST</p>
			<p>Letting potential customers know about a niche video service is a huge challenge for an SVOD service. An even bigger problem is getting people to sign up for the service and enter their credit card information. For some service providers, the barrier is just too high.</p>
			<p>PBR (Professional Bull Riders) launched RidePass in early 2018 at $7.99 a month, later increasing the price to $9.99. The service, promoted as the Netflix of Western sports, brought viewers a mix of on-demand content and live rodeo broadcasts.</p>
			<p>PBR RidePass on Pluto TVThe owners of RidePass seem to have concluded that they can better monetize the content by making it available for free ad-supported through FAST market leader Pluto TV. On July 20th, Pluto TV will become the exclusive home for RidePass content. Western sports fans will be able to watch the live rodeo and pre-recorded content via a linear channel and on-demand for free on Pluto TV.</p>
			<p>The move solves the two biggest SVOD challenges for PBR. Pluto TV will help market the PBR channel and content to Western sports fans and the 50 million global Pluto TV users. More importantly, removing the paywall should boost viewership of the content dramatically. The RidePass content also complements Pluto&rsquo;s existing western-themed channels. It provides the Western TV channel, with favorites like Walker Texas Ranger and The Lone Ranger, and Westerns channel, with movies like True Grit and The Alamo.</p>
			<p>Samsung sets TV Plus free</p>
			<p>Bringing virtual linear (vLinear) TV channels to smart TV buyers via an embedded FAST service is a natural fit for manufacturers. The channels are nice free benefit of buying the TV and give brands like Samsung, Vizio, and LG something to compete on other than picture quality and price.</p>
			<p>However, the PBR/Pluto TV deal underlines the inherent limitations of binding a FAST service to a single smart TV brand. According to Magid, standalone FAST service Pluto TV is used by 14% of US adults while device-locked Samsung TV Plus is used by just 5%. For a provider like PBR looking to switch to free streaming, Pluto TV and not Samsung TV Plus is the best choice.Magid AVOD users Q1 2021</p>
			<p>Samsung is loosening the reins on its TV Plus, untethering it from the company&rsquo;s smart TVs. In April, the company allowed owners of certain Samsung phones to install the TV Plus app and watch free on their mobile. In May of 2021, the company quietly launched a browser version of TV Plus. Now US users can watch 170 channels of free TV whether or not they own a Samsung device.</p>
			<p>Look for other smart TV manufacturers to untether their device-bound FAST services and promote the availability much more heavily than Samsung has done. The second-mover in the market could be Vizio, with WatchFree. The device maker is repositioning itself as an entertainment company a la Roku. Making WatchFree available across all connected devices should help it compete more directly with Pluto TV.<br>

			</p>
			<p>The Professional Bull Riders&rsquo; subscription video service RidePass is coming to Pluto TV. The ad-supported streamer will be the exclusive home to PBR&rsquo;s RidePass service starting July 20, which will now be a free, ad-supported service like Pluto&rsquo;s current model.</p>
			<p>The first event featured on RidePass after moving to Pluto will be Utah&rsquo;s &ldquo;Days of 47 Cowboy Games and Rodeo,&rdquo; on July 20-24. Upcoming programming includes PBR&rsquo;s Unleash The Beast and Pendleton Whisky Velocity Tour, marquee rodeos including WCRA Triple Crown, Indian National Finals Rodeo, Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo, and National High School Rodeo Finals, premier horse and equestrian events, including &ldquo;Road to the Horse,&rdquo; highlight shows, and western sports shoulder programming. </p>
			<p>RidePass launched in 2018 as a paid subscription featuring bull riding, rodeos, and other western sporting events. The current monthly subscription of $9.99 will now be eliminated as it comes to Pluto for free.</p>
			<p>PBR also has a TV rights deal with CBS Sports through 2028.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This new relationship with Pluto TV allows PBR to super-serve fans with hundreds of events and thousands of hours of great western sports programming now available for free,&rdquo; Sean Gleason, PBR commissioner and CEO, said in a statement. &ldquo;With PBR&rsquo;s linear and streaming live event content all within the ViacomCBS family through CBS and Pluto TV, we will benefit from tremendous synergies to grow this first-of-its-kind sports network.&rdquo;<br>

			<p>Seven West Media has announced its broadcast partners and sponsors for the Tokyo Olympic Games 2020, running from 23 July to 8 August 2021, followed by the Paralympic Games 24 August to 5 September.</p>
			<p>McDonald&rsquo;s Optus, Toyota and Woolworths join Seven&rsquo;s live and free coverage as broadcast partners, with AAMI, Harvey Norman and HP joining as broadcast sponsors.</p>
			<p>Local state sponsors include People&rsquo;s Choice Credit Union and LiveLighter. A number of additional large sponsors have been signed but cannot be named at this stage, according to a release from Seven.</p>
			<p>Ad sales for the Tokyo Olympics have also surpassed that of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games according to Seven West Media chief revenue officer and director of olympics, Kurt Burnette.</p>
			<p>Kurt Burnette at the 100 days event</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are particularly thrilled at the number of new and returning brands that have flocked to the event, recognising the significance and power of this unique moment in time.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Tokyo 2020 will bring Australia together in huge numbers. With an Australian-friendly time zone, it will be prime time all the time on Seven, with high-impact and high-demand inventory active across the 17 days of the Olympics and 16 days later for the Paralympics Games.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Seven will be implementing interactive ad formats for brands throughout Tokyo 2020 and beyond via its audience insights division 7REDiQ and Enhanced Audience and Viewer Experience, to make &ldquo;advertising more personal, valuable and enjoyable, and produce more effective results for advertisers&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;7ACT allows brands to insert dynamic QR codes into video assets and create unique, customised experiences that drive action,&rdquo; Burnette added.</p>
			<p>Seven will also be providing sponsors and advertisers with total audience delivery reporting on broadcast and digital elements of their campaigns. Tokyo 2020 is also the first Olympics set to be reported on by OzTam&rsquo;s VOZ.</p>
			<p>The games organisers recently confirmed that there will be no audiences at the games. A Seven spokesperson told Mumbrella:  &ldquo;Even without crowds, there&rsquo;s so much at stake in every Olympic event. The athletes have waited at least four years &#150; five years this time around &#150; for their big moment, so the excitement, tension, emotion and drama will be unmistakable no matter what.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Seven has learnt about broadcasting from venues with no crowds or restricted numbers over the past year, during the 2020 season of the AFL for example &#150; which continued without live crowds last year but continued to draw television audiences.</p>
			<p>Ahead of Tokyo 2020, Seven launched a $1 million in media contest to find the best ad shown during the event as voted by the public.</p>
			<p>Seven&rsquo;s coverage of the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 will include 45 dedicated Olympics channels across Channel Seven, 7Mate and 7Plus, all free and in HD.<br>

			<p><b><i>Foxtel hires Kate de Brito to lead new streaming service<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.theage.com.au/business/companies/foxtel-hires-kate-de-brito-to-lead-new-streaming-service-20210711-p588o8.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>Pay TV company Foxtel has appointed former news.com.au editor-in-chief Kate de Brito to lead a soon-to-launch third streaming service focused on news content, as the company makes a series of structural changes to prepare it for the future.</p>
			<p>Foxtel, which implemented a major restructure last year, is bringing 100 call centre roles focused on retaining customers back on local soil, as it sends about more than 10 jobs in scheduling and programming overseas. The News Corporation controlled group&rsquo;s general manager of Fox Creative, Mat Harrington, and two employees that work in publicity have also left the business.</p>
			<p>KayoSports was the first streaming service launched by Foxtel. NewsFlash will become the third and is expected to launch later this year.</p>
			<p>A Foxtel spokesman said the new call centre jobs would be based across Melbourne and the Gold Coast.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The aim is to improve the experience for Foxtel customers by having all these more complex call centre roles based in Australia by the end of the year,&rdquo; the Foxtel spokesman said.</p>
			<p>Foxtel&rsquo;s call centres were overwhelmed early in the coronavirus pandemic, particularly when sports coverage was suspended.</p>
			<p>The Foxtel spokesman also confirmed that about 15 roles were moving off-shore, which are part of a &ldquo;modernisation&rdquo; strategy being implemented. Sources familiar with the outsourcing plans, who were not authorised to speak publicly, also said shifting these operations is also a lot cheaper.</p>
			<p>Foxtel has made several major structural changes to modernise the legacy pay TV company. Chief executive Patrick Delany slashed hundreds of jobs during the pandemic to save costs and shift the company&rsquo;s focus to streaming, before launching entertainment service Binge last May. Mr Delany flagged the creation of more streaming services in a speech in June.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It started with Kayo and a technology platform that is completely scalable at very little incremental cost. We have added Binge to that platform, and soon, we&rsquo;ll add our other streaming services &#150; Foxtel Now and Foxtel GO,&rdquo; he said at the time.</p>
			<p>A Foxtel spokesman confirmed Ms de Brito was working on the &ldquo;business case&rdquo; for its new service, NewsFlash. James Law, who currently runs News Corp&rsquo;s newly formed newswire, has left his role to work with Ms de Brito.</p>
			<p>NewsFlash is likely to launch later this year for about $5 a month. It is expected to feature content from Sky News Australia and other news channels currently available on Foxtel. It is not clear if Fox News will be part of the offering.</p>
			<p>The Australian Financial Review&rsquo;s Street Talk column reported last week Foxtel was once again considering an initial public offering and was testing potential deal structures and valuations. Sources close to Telstra (which owns 35 per cent of Foxtel) said the telco was eager to IPO the business.</p>
			<p>Foxtel has tried to IPO multiple times before, most recently in 2016. Should it decide to progress with a float, the pay TV company will be hoping its streaming assets can attract investors.</p>
			<p>Once a dominant cable TV company, Foxtel has struggled in the face of fierce competition from offshore streaming giants such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+ and local players such as Stan (which is owned by Nine, the owner of this masthead). Despite its move into streaming, the company&rsquo;s profit is still tied to high margins from legacy products like Foxtel and Foxtel Now (Foxtel is pre-registering users for its set top box - IQ5).</p>
			<p>However, its most recent financial results indicate that investing in streaming services such as Kayo Sports and Binge are helping to build a new customer base.</p>
			<p>On a reported basis, News Corp&rsquo;s subscription and video revenues grew 13 per cent to $US61 million ($78.3 million) year on year. EBITDA for the subscription video service segment grew 34 per cent.</p>
			<p>Foxtel has 3.5 million subscribers - less than 2 million residential and commercial subscribers. Kayo Sports has hit one million subscribers and Binge has more than 500,000, according to the latest public results.</p>
			<p>Its future investment in streaming won&rsquo;t be without challenges. The rise of services like Disney+ and soon-to-launch Paramount+ have made it harder for local players like Foxtel, its streaming service Binge, and Stan to buy the rights to as many international programs.</p>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/12/intelsat-bankruptcy-exit-plan-adjourned/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Intelsat, currently trading as a Debtor in Possession under Chapter 11 rules, has asked its bankruptcy court to start hearing its Disclosure Statement on August 11th.</p>
			<p>The original wish was for the hearing to take place on July 27th, but that now looks likely to be postponed until August 11th, given that 28 says notice must be allowed for objections to be filed.</p>
			<p>Intelsat filed its bankruptcy disclosure and exit plan, a 145-page document, back on February 12th. At the time, it had been hoped that by May 3rd a Confirmation Hearing would have been agreed for the exit plan itself.</p>
			<p>Intelsat is now asking that the August 11th hearing approve its Disclosure Statement, its processes and procedures for the distribution of bankruptcy funds, the forms of ballot and notices regarding the exit plan, and setting a voting date for the overall exit process and other routine matters concerned with the actual process of exiting bankruptcy.</p>
			<p>The Motion to the court lists all of Intelsat&rsquo;s debt-holders many of which are spread through dozens of Intelsat intercompany and sister businesses. Many are entitled to vote on the exit plan dependent on whether the debt is in a &lsquo;Voting Class&rsquo; or &lsquo;Non-Voting Class&rsquo;. Intelsat is recommending that holders of claims should vote to accept its exit plan.</p>
			<p>There are a few hurdles, not least the SES vs Intelsat claim for a greater share of the FCC&rsquo;s C-band incentive payments, plus the SES action for substantial damages to be levied against Intelsat. The bankruptcy judge can ring-fence these claims until a decision is resolved one way or another, although the court can approve the exit plan if its wishes.</p>
			<p>The key dates for the SES claim against Intelsat are September 20th, when a trial is due to commence and take two weeks. By August 16th, both parties must inform the court of the witnesses they intend calling.</p>
			<p>On June 23rd, Intelsat appointed a firm of restructuring advisors.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.eletimes.com/isro-swinging-back-to-full-action-plans-to-launch-geo-imaging-satellite<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is getting back into launch activity fully at Sriharikota spaceport with the planned orbiting of geo imaging satellite GISAT-1 onboard GSLV-F10 rocket on August 12. It&rsquo;s going to be only the second launch of the Bengaluru-headquartered space agency in the Covid-19-hit 2021. ISRO successfully launched the PSLV-C51 mission on February 28 with Brazil&rsquo;s earth observation satellite Amazonia-1 and 18 co-passengers, including some built by students, on board.</p>
			<p>The 2,268-kg GISAT-1 was originally slated to be launched from Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh&rsquo;s Nellore district, about 100 km north of Chennai, on March 5 last year but was postponed a day before the blast-off due to technical reasons.</p>
			<p>Thereafter, the launch was delayed due to Covid-19- induced lockdown which affected normal work. It was scheduled for March 28 this year but a &ldquo;minor issue&rdquo; with the satellite forced its postponement.</p>
			<p>The launch was later expected in April and then in May but the campaign could not be taken up due to lockdown in parts of the country triggered by the second wave of the pandemic.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We have tentatively planned the GSLV-F10 launch on August 12, at 05.43 am, subject to weather conditions&rdquo;, an ISRO official told PTI on Saturday.</p>
			<p>According to ISRO, GISAT-1 will facilitate near real- time observation of the Indian sub-continent, under cloud-free conditions, at frequent intervals.</p>
			<p>GISAT-1 will be placed in a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit by GSLV-F10 and, subsequently, it will be positioned in the final geostationary orbit, about 36,000 km above earth&rsquo;s equator, using its on board propulsion system.</p>
			<p>The earth observation satellite will provide the country near real-time images of its borders and also enable quick monitoring of natural disasters.</p>
			<p>Experts said positioning the state-of-the-art agile earth observation satellite in geostationary orbit has key advantages.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a game-changer in some sense for India,&rdquo; a Department of Space official said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;With onboard high-resolution cameras, the satellite will allow the country to monitor the Indian landmass and the oceans, particularly its borders, continuously,&rdquo; the official said.</p>
			<p>Listing the objectives of the mission, ISRO had earlier said the satellite would provide near real-time imaging of the large area region of interest at frequent intervals.</p>
			<p>It would help in quick monitoring of natural disasters, episodic, and any short-term events.</p>
			<p>The third objective is to obtain spectral signatures of agriculture, forestry, mineralogy, disaster warning, cloud properties, snow and glacier and oceanography.<br>

			<p><b><i>Forecast: Android TV shines as pay-TV market declines <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/09/forecast-android-tv-shines-as-pay-tv-market-declines/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Android TV and Huawei&rsquo;s HarmonyOS are set to dominate the coming years across both the shrinking footprint of operator set tops, and the ballooning number of smart TVs and connected TV (CTV) devices, according to forecasts from Rethink TV.</p>
			<p>Pay-TV households will decline from an estimated 921 million in 2020 to 680 million in 2026, impacting the annual shipments of Operator Set Tops, which falls from 242.6 million to 184.8 million, propped up by the upgrade cycle for new Set Top Box operating systems.</p>
			<p>This means that the install base for set tops is set to decline from 1.21 billion in 2020 to 824.67 million in 2026, while the Smart TVs &amp; Connected TV Devices segment is expected to grow from an installed base of 497 million in 2020 to 905 million in 2026.</p>
			<p>Operators will ditch resource-thirsty legacy Linux-based Proprietary set tops as their footprint of pay TV homes starts to decline around the world, with the market share such systems falling from around 85 per cent in 2020 to 48 per cent in 2026. This transformation will see a global uptick in Android TV and HarmonyOS set tops, with RDK making some progress in Europe and keeping hold of the US market.</p>
			<p>Globally, Android TV Operator Tier will grow from around 5 per cent of the installed operator set top base to some 23 per cent, in 2026. RDK, meanwhile, is only expected to grow from 6 per cent to 10 per cent, even with interest from Tier 1 operators in Europe. Almost doubling your footprint would normally be a cause for celebration, but when compared to Android TV Operator Tier&rsquo;s success, it is not as emphatic.</p>
			<p>Linux is also set to decline in the world of smart TVs and CTV devices, as LG&rsquo;s WebOS, Samsung&rsquo;s Tizen and Roku&rsquo;s platform lose ground to the rise of Android TV and Huawei&rsquo;s HarmonyOS. This will also drive out Chromecast and AOSP-based installations, with former&rsquo;s decline catalysed by a decline in demand for CTV devices as device replacement cycles lead smart TVs become the standard first screen in the home.</p>
			<p>Android TV is set to reach 25 per cent share of Smart TVs and Connected TV Devices by 2026, representing an estimated 236 million of a total 905 million devices.</p>
			<p>Perhaps the standout feature of our findings is the rise of HarmonyOS. The trade dispute between China and the US, with resulting concerns over access to Android updates, has galvanised the Chinese government to push for a major independent national OS, with HarmonyOS the apparent preferred candidate. The long-term consequences for Google and Android of this trade dispute could be enormous and almost entirely negative.</p>
			<p>In the short term, Huawei and others will continue to favour Android for set top and other connected devices, including smartphones and tablets &#150; leading to growth in China for Android, initially. However, the likely longer-term direction is towards HarmonyOS as a ubiquitous cross-platform OS that will also increasingly take on Android in neutral markets outside China &#150; especially in APAC and Latin America, says Rethink TV.<br>

			<p><b><i>Repurposed communications satellites could help save humanity from an asteroid impact<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.space.com/asteroid-deflection-with-telecommunication-satellites<br>
			</p>
			<p>What do you do if you discover a big rock on a collision course with Earth and have very little time to take action?</p>
			<p>Large satellites used for TV broadcasting could be quickly and easily repurposed as asteroid deflectors if a space rock were to threaten Earth, according to a study by the European aerospace company Airbus. </p>
			<p>The study, part of a mission concept called Fast Kinetic Deflection (FastKD), was commissioned by the European Space Agency (ESA), as part of its effort to prepare for an apocalyptic scenario that will certainly happen one day (even though that day might be in a very distant future).</p>
			<p>Telecommunication satellites that sit in the so-called geostationary orbit at the altitude of 22,000 miles (36,000 kilometers) circle Earth at a speed that matches the rotation of the planet, thus appearing permanently suspended above a certain region. These satellites are usually very large, like a small bus. They might weigh 4 to 6 tons, which would give them enough force to affect the trajectory of an approaching space rock. </p>
			<p>Still, as Albert Falke, who led the FastKD study at Airbus, told Space.com, it would require maybe 10 such spacecraft hitting a 1,000-foot-wide (300 meters) asteroid within a short period of time to sufficiently change its trajectory to avoid the planet. </p>
			<p>Readily available</p>
			<p>&quot;These telecommunication platforms, in addition to being large and heavy, are also built with quite a high frequency,&quot; Falke said. &quot;That means we can expect them to be available readily in the integration facilities [of satellite manufacturers]. That's something we can take for granted.&quot;</p>
			<p>In 2019, for example, 15 geostationary satellites were ordered by commercial satellite operators worldwide, according to SpaceNews.</p>
			<p>In the scenario explored by Airbus, if astronomers detect an asteroid on a collision course with Earth, all satellite manufacturers around the world will have to start converting the telecoms satellites they are currently building into anti-asteroid weapons. All of these missions would have to launch within about one month to reach the asteroid at about the same time.</p>
			<p>The combined effect of the satellites crashing into the Earthbound rock may change its trajectory by only an inch or two, but that would be enough to nudge it off course and prevent a disaster if done long enough before the expected impact. </p>
			<p>&quot;The bottleneck [for the success of such a mission] will be the rockets,&quot; Falke said. &quot;We think we could expect about 10 to 15 launches available within one month around the entire globe.&quot;</p>
			<p>Preparations needed</p>
			<p>Airbus chose available technology instead of building a new spacecraft completely from scratch for one simple reason: Astronomers may only spot an asteroid on a collision course with Earth not that long in advance. The deflection mission might take anywhere between six to 18 months to reach its target, which might leave only about six months for the engineers to make the craft ready. </p>
			<p>&quot;The detection of asteroids has very much improved over the last decades,&quot; Falke said. &quot;There are huge observation programs, mostly pushed by NASA. So all the big asteroids, 1 km (0.6 miles) in size and larger should be known. But of course, there are some which could not be observed in the past because their orbits are six to eight years, and their last close approach may have been before these telescopes were put in place,&quot; he added.</p>
			<p>It is theoretically possible for a threatening asteroid to be spotted tomorrow, with only months left before a devastating encounter with Earth, Falke added. Some smaller bodies, such as the 2013 Chelyabinsk asteroid, which triggered a shockwave that injured about 1,200 people in Russia, may arrive completely unnoticed.</p>
			<p>To be able to execute an Earth-saving mission in orbit, telecommunication satellites would have to be fitted with a special module that enables communication in deep space, as well as navigation and guidance required to approach the asteroid. These modules have yet to be developed. Ideally, they would be built and tested in advance and stand ready in case of an emergency.</p>
			<p>&quot;We do need to have concrete plans on how to make this deflection module and put it on the telecommunications platform,&quot; Falke said. &quot;Then we need to perform very fast qualification and test activity before putting this deflection system on the launch pad.&quot;</p>
			<p>Widespread destruction</p>
			<p>Humankind, according to Falke, should want to be prepared. If a 1,000-foot-wide (300 m) asteroid, such as that envisioned in the Airbus study, hit somewhere in central Europe, it would cause widespread destruction across the whole continent. </p>
			<p>&quot;Such an impact would produce a shockwave and also firestorms and earthquakes,&quot; Falke said. &quot;A lot of material would be thrown up into the atmosphere and then come down further away from the impact zone. I think the whole of Europe would have to be evacuated and all the flora and fauna would be destroyed in the months and years after such an impact.&quot;</p>
			<p>Falke is cautious to say whether an asteroid larger than 1,000 feet (300 m) in diameter could still be deflected using this method. But that's an important question. The asteroid that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs some 60 million years ago is believed to have been at least 6 miles (9.6 km) in diameter. </p>
			<p>&quot;If the asteroid becomes larger [than 1,000 feet], it gets more difficult,&quot; Falke said. &quot;But the good thing is that such big objects will be known a very long time in advance so we would have time to prepare.&quot;</p>
			<p>Humankind seems to be in a better position than the dinosaurs. The world's first asteroid deflection experiment is set to take place next year when a NASA mission called DART is expected to ram into a small asteroid moon Dimorphos, which orbits a larger asteroid Didymos. The goal is to change the orbit of 520-foot-wide (160 m) Didymos with a 270-pound (600 kilograms) spacecraft.</p>
			<p>The study results were presented at the Planetary Defence Conference 2021<br>

			<p><b><i>Prospero: Quest to retrieve 50-year-old UK space debris<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57758410<br>
			</p>
			<p>Edinburgh-based rocket company Skyrora is issuing a challenge to find a way to retrieve the Prospero satellite.</p>
			<p>The object was the first and only UK spacecraft to be launched on a British rocket, from Australia in 1971.</p>
			<p>It's defunct now, obviously, but is still circling the globe on an elliptical orbit some 1,000km up.</p>
			<p>Skyrora, who will soon start sending up rockets from Scotland, regards the satellite as an important piece of UK space heritage.</p>
			<p>The company has already recovered part of the Black Arrow vehicle that placed Prospero in orbit.</p>
			<p>This fell back to Australia in the course of the mission where it languished for decades in the Outback until the firm had it shipped home and put on display.</p>
			<p>Now, Skyrora is looking for ideas as to how best to approach and grab hold of the 66kg satellite, whose original mission was to investigate the space environment.</p>
			<p>It might not be possible to bring it all the way home through the atmosphere intact. This would be very difficult. For starters, it would need protection from the heat of re-entry, but, at the very least, just de-orbiting what is now a piece of junk would be a statement of Britain's commitment to the sustainable use of space.</p>
			<p>Orbits above the Earth are becoming cluttered with old hardware, which risks colliding with, and destroying, those operationally useful spacecraft that provide us with important services such as Earth observation, meteorology, and telecommunications.</p>
			<p>&quot;This is a challenge to ourselves, to the space industry in the UK,&quot; said Alan Thompson, Skyrora's head of government affairs.</p>
			<p>&quot;Ultimately, we'd love to recover Prospero and bring it all the way down, but we recognise that would be very difficult.</p>
			<p>&quot;The point here, though, is to accentuate industry principles of responsibility and sustainability,&quot; he told BBC News.</p>
			<p>The company held a reception on Wednesday evening to discuss ideas. This took place at the inaugural UK Space-Comm Expo, which is being staged this week at the Farnborough International Exhibition &amp; Conference Centre in Hampshire.</p>
			<p>Prospero and its launch rocket, Black Arrow, represented something of a false dawn for Britain's space efforts. Even as the lipstick-shaped rocket climbed skyward, the government had already decided to cancel the technology development programme.</p>
			<p>The UK remains the only country to have developed a successful launch capability and then abandon it.</p>
			<p>Half a century on, an indigenous capacity is being revived in the form of Skyrora, Orbex and a handful of other start-ups who wish to launch from the UK proper - not this time from Australia.</p>
			<p>Regulations are in the process of being signed off by government with the intention that operating licences will be open for application later this year.</p>
			<p>Skyrora is determined to pursue its activities in as green a way as possible.</p>
			<p>Although burning a carbon-based fuel, kerosene, in its rockets, this will be made from recycled plastic. It also wants the top section, or third stage, of its orbital vehicle to not only place satellites in orbit, but be capable of removing redundant spacecraft as well.</p>
			<p>It's been busy testing a &quot;space tug&quot; that would do just this kind of work.</p>
			<p>&quot;The challenge of removing space debris and either knocking it into the atmosphere so that it burns up, or bringing it back to Earth, is one of the most important and topical challenges in space,&quot; commented Lord Willetts, the former UK space minister.</p>
			<p>&quot;It would be great if British enterprise and British entrepreneurship played a role in tackling this challenge.&quot;</p>
			<p>In order to retrieve Prospero, you'd first have to locate it. Although the satellite is no longer communicating with Earth (last contact was in 2004), it's orbit is known, says Ralph Dinsley from space surveillance experts Northern Space &amp; Security Ltd.</p>
			<p>&quot;It's in an elliptical orbit around the Earth, coming as close as about 522km and going out as far as about 1,300km,&quot; he said.</p>
			<p>&quot;Not only is Prospero up there, but part of the rocket body that put it there is up there as well.</p>
			<p>&quot;Finding Prospero is all about applying inspiration to what we need to do for the future. There's a lot of discussion about active debris removal, a lot of discussion about the threat of the space junk apocalypse. Wouldn't be great if the UK actually took responsibility for some of that junk?&quot;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/08/industry-majors-team-for-6g-research/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Teaming up with industry majors including Samsung, NVIDIA and more, researchers at The University of Texas are launching 6G@UT, a new research centre to lay the groundwork for 6G, the next generation of wireless technology.</p>
			<p>5G is just emerging as the dominant cellular technology after years of research and innovation that includes important contributions by UT Austin wireless researchers and alumni. With new technologies on the horizon such as self-driving cars and air taxis, holographic video conferencing, ubiquitous robotics and immersive augmented reality, UT Austin is cementing its leadership in wireless innovation with this major research effort on 6G.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The advances in both wireless communications and machine learning over the past decade have been incredible, but separate,&rdquo; said 6G@UT Director Jeffrey Andrews, a professor in UT Austin&rsquo;s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. &ldquo;Coupled with vast new sensing and localisation abilities, 6G will be defined by an unprecedented native intelligence, which will transform the ability of the network to provide incredible services.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Founding 6G@UT affiliates Samsung, AT&amp;T, NVIDIA, Qualcomm and InterDigital will each fund at least two projects for three years at the centre. Researchers from the companies will work alongside UT faculty members and students to develop wireless-specific machine learning algorithms, advanced sensing technologies, and core networking innovations that will be the backbone of 6G.</p>
			<p>The next generation of wireless will be infused with technologies that have come of age during the past decade: ubiquitous sensing, machine learning and the ability to use higher frequency spectrum at mmWave and THz bands. These technologies will be at the heart of the research happening at the 6G@UT centre, and they will play a critical role not only in the devices and applications running 6G but in managing the network itself.</p>
			<p>Radio waves not only facilitate communication, but also sensing and localisation, via radar and GPS, for example. The introduction of THz bands and the superior sensing resolution through massively dense antenna arrays will allow carriers to better monitor the quality of their networks in different places &#151; from office towers to busy downtown areas to far-flung rural locales. 6G networks will be loaded with radar, vision, audio, lidar, thermal, seismic and broadband software-defined radio sensors that will provide unprecedented situational awareness to applications and devices running on the network.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;5G&rsquo;s vision of sensing has been insufficiently bold,&rdquo; said Todd Humphreys, associate professor in UT Austin&rsquo;s Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics. &ldquo;6G should begin with the premise that sensing is not just for reacting to conditions, but anticipating them, so that vital links to automated vehicles, AR/VR headsets, and other latency-sensitive applications can be maintained with utter reliability.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Other major pillars of the new centre, and crucial parts of 6G, include the need to open new spectrum and low Earth orbit satellite links to improve coverage across rural and urban areas and design new network architectures to enable better resource and infrastructure sharing.</p>
			<p>The 6G@UT centre is spun out of the Cockrell School&rsquo;s Wireless Networking &amp; Communications Group, a 19-year-old research centre with more than 25 faculty members and 130 students and researchers. WNCG has established UT Austin as a global leader in wireless technology, and its researchers have made important breakthroughs that helped enable 4G and 5G technology. Students graduating from UT Austin have played important roles in creating and standardising these technologies at WNCG&rsquo;s industrial affiliates.<br>

			<p><b><i>Hellas Sat&rsquo;s Live Demo Accomplishes 5G Satellite Backhauling<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://news.satnews.com/2021/07/08/helas-sats-live-demo-accomplishes-5g-satellite-backhauling/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Hellas Sat has successfully completed a live demonstration of the provision of 5G networking to remote areas by backhauling the connection between a 5G Core Network and a 5G gNB through Hellas Sat 3, a geostationary telecommunication satellite, which was built by Thales Alenia Space on the Spacebus 4000 C4 platform.</p>
			<p>The demonstration took place during an event that marked Hellas Sat&rsquo;s 20-year anniversary that was organized in partnership with KT-SAT, ST Engineering iDirect, Thales Alenia Space, and Vodafone Greece to showcase the satellites&rsquo; role in the 5G ecosystem to broaden coverage.</p>
			<p>Using satellite communication backhaul links, the satellite was fully integrated into the 5G network and received 5G transmissions from the Earth and then delivered these to remote areas. This technology enables increased coverage in areas where traditional backhauling technologies (wired, fiber, radio beams) are not suitable for technical and/or economic reasons.</p>
			<p>The connection of the Hellas Sat 3 satellite to the 5G network has been enabled by the use of Thales Alenia Space and ST Engineering iDirect hub and modem equipment as well as Vodafone&rsquo;s 5G licensed spectrum. Specifically, Vodafone Greece provided bands from its 5G spectrum in 2100 MHz and 3600 MHz frequency zones which support the roll-out of its 5G network in Greece, bringing new possibilities to citizens and businesses, through Gigabit speeds and lower latency.</p>
			<p>The world&rsquo;s first router for hybrid satellite-terrestrial 5G transmission developed by KT-SAT was also showcased at the event. During the showcase, 5G terminals were connected to the router to simultaneously transmit and receive various types of data, or utilized separate routes, to and from a 5G network and a satellite. The terminals successfully maintained normal service operations with the Hellas Sat satellite connectivity, even after the 5G network was intentionally disconnected.</p>
			<p>The successful, hybrid-terrestrial-satellite 5G transmission showed how this technology can enable 5G-based automated machinery or moving vehicles to maintain its network connection when 5G coverage becomes unavailable, or a natural disaster has occurred.</p>
			<p>Christodoulos Protopapas, CEO of Hellas Sat, said, &ldquo;With the completion of 20 years of operations, Hellas Sat is exploring the new era of 5G communications providing satellite connectivity solutions to rural areas.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Mike Jeong, Senior Director of KT SAT&rsquo;s Marketing and Sales, said, &ldquo;We are pleased to be part of this event and demonstrate Hybrid solution to share our view towards a new era of telecommunication by satellite and 5G. This will be a great start of our partnership with Hellas Sat and all members of KT SAT hope to bring more discussions and opportunities together in near future to develop innovative satellite solutions.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Marc-Henri Serre, Executive Vice President of Thales Alenia Space&rsquo;s Telecommunications Business Line, said, &ldquo;At Thales Alenia Space, we are honored to support Hellas Sat with this 5G demonstration. This marks another step in our partnership and reinforces Thales Alenia Space&rsquo;s expertise in 5G. Also, this shows that we are pioneers and that our satellites fits with all the challenges of our changing world.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Nikos Plevris, Head of the Vodafone Transmission and Transport Department and Group Networks Strategy &amp; Engineering in Greece said, &ldquo;At Vodafone we want to be a catalyst for tomorrow&rsquo;s networks. Our cooperation with Hellas Sat demonstrated the possibilities of 5G networks and confirmed the role that satellites communications could have in expanding coverage in remote areas.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Premier League pirate jailed <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/08/premier-league-pirate-jailed/<br>
			</p>
			<p>A UK man who ran an operation offering illegal access to Premier League football has been jailed for 16 months.</p>
			<p>Paul Faulkner appeared in front of Liverpool Crown Court in the northwest of England on July 6th after pleading guilty to multiple copyright and fraud offences, including accessing pirate content for his own use.</p>
			<p>Faulkner was the operator of subscription-based IPTV service TV Solutions, a pirate streaming service that offered illegal access to sports and entertainment broadcast content, including live Premier League matches and Sky channels.</p>
			<p>He pleaded guilty to both the unlawful supply of content and his own use of the service to view content he should have been paying to watch. The judge recognised that Faulkner&rsquo;s use of the unauthorised service was a distinct crime in itself. This was reflected in him receiving a separate sentence of four months&rsquo; imprisonment for using the service.</p>
			<p>Despite the defendant selling access to his service on social media platforms as a secondary source of income, the judge made it clear this case was a sophisticated fraud carried out over a significant period of time, made more serious by the involvement of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).</p>
			<p>The Premier League worked with UK intellectual property protection body FACT to track down the offender and brought legal action against him in a private prosecution.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This sentencing demonstrates yet again that the courts take piracy crimes seriously and there are significant consequences for criminals involved in all forms of piracy,&rdquo; stated Premier League Director of Legal Services Kevin Plumb. Legal action will be taken against those supplying unauthorised access to Premier League football, regardless of the size or scale of the pirate operation.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This defendant was also given a separate four-month prison sentence for simply watching the unauthorised service. If it were needed, this should dispel any misconception that watching pirate streaming services is a grey area or is not an offence in any way,&rdquo; he warned.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The Premier League&rsquo;s significant financial support for the entire football pyramid and wider communities is made possible through being able to sell and protect our broadcast rights. We are pleased that, through judgments such as this, courts continue to recognise the importance of the protection of our copyright,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are very pleased to see the courts once again deal with the problem of illegal streaming by delivering sentencing appropriate to the harm caused by these crimes,&rdquo; added FACT Chief Executive Officer Kieron Sharp. &ldquo;Furthermore, a separate sentence for Faulkner using the service as a consumer is important to highlight that end users are committing offences when accessing illegal streaming services. It is a massive warning.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;FACT will continue to work with our members to monitor platforms used to advertise, market, sell and distribute apps, devices and streams, and to take action against suppliers, operators and consumers,&rdquo; he confirmed.<br>

			<p><b><i>Analyst: Prospects for Warhammer+ SVoD <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/08/analyst-warhammer-a-spring-board-to-broader-audiences/<br>
			</p>
			<p>UK-based table-top battle games manufacturer, Games Workshop, is scheduled to launch its own global SVoD platform, Warhammer+, in August 2021. The new niche service will show animated content based on the company&rsquo;s table-top gaming intellectual property (IP), and provide subscribers access to the company&rsquo;s host of game support apps, the back catalogue of the company&rsquo;s magazine publication White Dwarf, and other benefits.</p>
			<p>Warhammer+, priced at $5.99/&pound;4.99 per month or $59.99/&pound;49.99 via an annual subscription, will carry just 11 episodic animated titles at launch.</p>
			<p> Richard Cooper, Research Director at Ampere Analysis, offers insight into the creation and future of the new platform. He writes:</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Historically Games Workshop has successfully leveraged its IP in the digital gaming sphere, spawning successful franchises such as Warhammer: Total War and Dawn of War. However, to date the company has struggled to translate this into filmed entertainment; the 2010 direct-to-Blu-ray movie release Ultramarines: A Warhammer 40,000 Movie achieved negligible success.</p>
			<p>After nearly 50 years in development, Games Workshop&rsquo;s Warhammer: Age of Sigmar and Warhammer 40,000&rsquo;s grim-dark war-torn universes are comparable in terms of depth and complexity to those of the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars franchises, and over the last decade the company has developed extensive narrative arcs through its self-published Black Library books, establishing more relatable characters and franchises. The long-established Games Workshop global fan base has also contributed greatly to the volume of Warhammer-based video content, largely published via platforms such as YouTube. Indeed, the company has leveraged some of this unlicenced IP usage as the foundation for its current slate.</p>
			<p>The SVoD market is dominated by giant global players, with extensive catalogues, and substantial pipelines of high-profile exclusive content. Smaller, local services that have sought to ape these platforms have struggled and closed in short order, unable to reach the critical mass required to sustain them. While the new Warhammer+ service has a limited appeal and is unlikely to drive significant subscriber numbers, compared to other standalone SVoD services, its aim is not to compete against the global giants.</p>
			<p>Through the pandemic-related lockdowns the popularity of Games Workshop&rsquo;s physical gaming products increased, with consumers using the greater levels of time-at-home to re-establish long forgotten hobbies. Despite the closure of the company&rsquo;s physical retail chain, the lockdowns of 2020 led to a comparatively small downturn in revenues; which it more than compensated for in its following half year results, published in November 2020.</p>
			<p>Offering more than just video, Warhammer+ will serve to capitalise on Games Workshop&rsquo;s core consumers&rsquo; renewed interest and act as a test bed for Warhammer-themed filmed entertainment. Moreover, this is offered at an annual cost comparable to the price of one of the company&rsquo;s table-top game starter boxsets, a cost easily justified by Warhammer&rsquo;s maturing fan base. Tapping into established, affluent, and devoted audiences is a successful strategy for such niche services and positions the subscription as overtly complementary to, rather than directly competitive with, the global players.</p>
			<p>Moreover, through service metrics Games Workshop will gain an enhanced understanding of the viewing interest for its content and enable it to identify filmed IP with proven appeal. As the US studios and international SVoD services vie to secure content rights to recognisable IP and future franchise content, Games Workshop&rsquo;s new platform could be the potential spring board to broaden its audiences and leverage its extensive IP through a new wave of filmed content, albeit via larger alternative VoD platforms.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>CSIRO to manage Australian-first observation satellite<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/7330905/csiros-new-satellite-able-to-photograph-through-clouds-smoke/?src=rss<br>
			</p>
			<p>observation satellite able to provide images of the Earth even through clouds or heavy bushfire smoke will now be at the fingertips of Australian researchers following an historic agreement.</p>
			<p>The CSIRO will from Thursday be able to operate the NovaSAR-1 satellite when it passes over Australia, with scientists able to gather images to help in areas from managing natural disaster recovery efforts or planning in the agriculture sector.</p>
			<p>It will be the first time Australia will be able to directly manage its own observation data from satellites in orbit, rather than having to rely on other countries.</p>
			<p>While Australia is one of the largest users of observation data from specialist satellites in space, it had previously had to piggyback off agreements in place with space organisations such as NASA to get the images.</p>
			<p>Director of the CSIRO Centre for Earth Observation Alex Held said the development was a critical step towards Australia being able to launch and operate its own satellites as part of its own space program.<br>
			</p>
			<p>The NovaSAR-1 satellite is able to capture images through smoke or clouds and will be able to be operated by Australian researchers for the first time. Picture: Supplied</p>
			<p>The NovaSAR-1 satellite is able to capture images through smoke or clouds and will be able to be operated by Australian researchers for the first time. Picture: Supplied</p>
			<p>&quot;Compared to other satellites, this one we can book and point the camera ourselves, rather than others where we get images that just happen to be collected from NASA,&quot; Dr Held said.</p>
			<p>&quot;This is the first imaging satellite that we can effectively control ourselves to collect data from anywhere that we're interested in.&quot;</p>
			<p>While there are multiple observational satellites in space, most, such as those used for Google Earth, collect images like a photograph, with varying levels of detail.</p>
			<p>The NovaSAR-1 satellite uses a different wavelength, which allows it to see through clouds or smoke haze to capture images on the ground where other satellites couldn't.</p>
			<p>Data from the satellite will be downloaded to a receiving station in Alice Springs, owned by the Centre for Appropriate Technology, the country's only Indigenous-owned and operated ground segment service provider.</p>
			<p>The satellite will pass over Australia every 90 minutes.</p>
			<p>Dr Held said the technology would allow for people to track damage from disasters such as bushfires or cyclones and help plan disaster responses.</p>
			<p>&quot;For instance, after a cyclone where it's still cloudy for other satellites to see images, we can use this one see through the clouds and see where it has impacted,&quot; he said.</p>
			<p>&quot;It even gives us the chance to look through the satellite at night or during hazy events.&quot;</p>
			<p>The satellite passes over Australia roughly every 90 minutes and can be programmed to capture 2.5 minutes worth of images at a time.</p>
			<p>Depending on its orbit, the satellite passes over the exact same area of the continent every few weeks, allowing researchers to know exactly when the powerful tool could be used to capture data.</p>
			<p>While data from the satellite would be able to be gathered by government departments and scientists, Dr Held said it would also be open to any other researchers who want to use it on a first come, first served basis.</p>
			<p>&quot;It would almost be like booking for a doctor's appointment, but we will still have a group of experts who will look through the proposals for use and deem which ones are good and what the data would be used for,&quot; he said.</p>
			<p>&quot;It's going to be an open system, so anyone would be able to access the archive and download the data.&quot;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2021/07/rocket-lab-s-peter-beck-defends-contracts-with-us-military-says-space-industry-intertwined-with-defence.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck has defended the company's contracts with the US military, saying the space industry is &quot;very, very intertwined with defence&quot;.</p>
			<p>He's flatly denying claims they've been putting satellites into orbit which could be used to &quot;hurt people&quot;, telling The AM Show on Thursday &quot;the mower comes out with the tall poppies&quot;. </p>
			<p>&quot;From day one we've always been very clear, but we've also been very clear about what we will do and what we don't do&#x2026; we're certainly not going to launch weapons or anything that damages the environment or goes and hurts people. But the reality is in the space industry it's very, very intertwined with defence.&quot;</p>
			<p>In March protesters opposed Rocket Lab's 'They Go Up So Fast' launch of a satellite called Gunsmoke-J, which the company described as &quot;an experimental 3U CubeSat that will test technologies that support development of new capabilities for the US Army&quot;. </p>
			<p>Minister for Economic Development Stuart Nash, who has veto power over any space launch from New Zealand soil, gave it the go-ahead. </p>
			<p>&quot;Unfortunately our outer space legislation has so many gaps and grey areas foreign military powers are literally launching rockets through it,&quot; Green MP Teanau Tuiono said in June. Auckland Peace Action claimed the satellite - and others Rocket Lab has put into orbit - could be used for &quot;communications with troops, surveillance and reconnaissance, intercepting information or spying, and targeting weapons, like drones, bombs, and also nuclear weapons&quot;.</p>
			<p>It's against New Zealand law to help &quot;any person to manufacture, acquire, possess, or have control over any nuclear explosive device&quot;, and any launch has to be in New Zealand's national interest - what that means exactly is left to the Minister for Economic Development. </p>
			<p>Cabinet says payloads with the &quot;intended end use of harming, interfering with, or destroying other spacecraft, or space systems on Earth&quot; are banned, as are those &quot;with the intended end use of supporting or enabling specific defence, security or intelligence operations that are contrary to Government policy&quot; or likely to cause &quot;serious or irreversible harm to the environment&quot;.</p>
			<p>New Zealand is part of the 'Five Eyes' surveillance network with the US. </p>
			<p>Beck said the US military satellite on the 'They Go Up So Fast' launch was &quot;a research and development payload for communications&quot;.</p>
			<p>&quot;It was about the size of a loaf of bread and it was to test various communications. You can spin whichever way you want to spin on any of this stuff. New Zealand as a country, we have the most robust space licensing process in the world. It's the only one that I know of in the world that requires a minister to sign off every single payload.&quot; </p>
			<p>Rocket Lab has never kept its work with the US military a secret, but they have &quot;also been very clear about what we will do and what we don't do&quot;, Beck said.</p>
			<p>&quot;At the end of the day, if you walk into Rocket Lab's building, the first sign you read is, 'We go to space to improve life on Earth'. That's the mandate of the company and what we do. There's always going to be people who don't necessarily agree with what you do and that's called a democracy and that's fine.&quot;</p>
			<p>Beck pointed to GPS as a technology developed and run by the US military that many of us take for granted.</p>
			<p>&quot;I got here by my car, plugged into Google, the friendly little voice got me here - that's all GPS satellites which are owned and operated by the US Defence Force. Military and defence is very, very intertwined with everything we do every day in space.&quot; </p>
			<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Beck talked up the company's education efforts in Kiwi schools, saying it's inspiring youngsters to take an interest in 'STEM' subjects - science, technology, engineering and mathematics. </p>
			<p>&quot;I went to one school and the kids had to dress up as what they wanted to be when they grew up&#x2026; and there were a lot of kids dressed up as their parents and a disproportionate number of firefighters and those kinds of things. Not one single scientist, engineer or entrepreneur.</p>
			<p>&quot;I went up there and we talked about the rocket and we talked about how we go to space and showed lots of videos and stuff. I came back the next year and did the same thing and there were three kids there in white lab coats with clipboards - and one of them was a girl. So it works.&quot;</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab is set to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange later this year for an estimated value of $4.1 billion. <br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2145207/nbtc-postpones-auction-by-almost-a-month<br>
			</p>
			<p>Delay an attempt to draw more bidders</p>
			<p>The National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) board has resolved to postpone the auction of four satellite orbital slot packages originally slated for July 24 by almost a month, in what is seen as an attempt to draw more potential bidders to the auction.</p>
			<p>A source at the NBTC board who requested anonymity said the postponement of the auction topped the agenda at the board meeting yesterday. Later on Wednesday, it was revealed by the NBTC that the auction will now take place on Aug 21.</p>
			<p>The source said the board did not discuss the suggestion of Digital Economy and Society (DES) Minister Chaiwut Thanakamanusorn, who indicated the auction should be pushed back until the new members of the NBTC board are appointed.</p>
			<p>The recruitment of the new board members is now underway.</p>
			<p>&quot;The postponement is not meant to wait for the new NBTC board members as it remains unclear when they will be appointed,&quot; the source said.</p>
			<p>Speculation was rife that the auction would have to be pushed back after only one firm -- TC Space Connect, a unit of SET-listed satellite service operator Thaicom -- participated in the auction.</p>
			<p>TC Space Connect is one of the two firms that earlier bought bid envelopes to compete in the auction. The other is mu Space and Advanced Technology, a local satellite and space tech firm.</p>
			<p>But mu Space did not show up to submit a bid request in line with the schedule on Monday.</p>
			<p>For the auction, the first package consists of 50.5&deg;East and 51&deg;E slots with a reserve price of 677 million baht; the second is 78.5&deg;E with a reserve price of 366.4 million baht; the third involves 119.5&deg;E and 120&deg;E at 393 million baht; and the last is for 126&deg;E and 142&deg;E for 364.6 million.</p>
			<p>TC Space Connect wants 119.5&deg;E slot in the third package, which is being used by Thaicom 4 satellite under a concession with the DES Ministry.</p>
			<p>Thaicom's concession expires in September, after which Thaicom 4 has to be handed over to the DES Ministry.</p>
			<p>TC Space Connect submitted the document that it is interested in bidding for 119.5&deg;E slot in the third package and placed a guarantee deposit of 67.7 million baht -- calculated from 10% of the reserve price of the package with the highest reserve price or the first.</p>
			<p>The NBTC's planned auction comes under pressure after Mr Chaiwut pointed out that the auction needs to be pushed back until the new NBTC board members come into office.</p>
			<p>In many countries, the state can keep some slots for particular state purposes and let others be put for auction or allocation, he said, adding the auction needs thorough and prudent consideration to ensure optimum benefits for the country<br>

			<p> China launched the Tianlian-1 05 into a preset orbit via a Long March-3C carrier rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Southwest China's Sichuan Province late on Tuesday, completing the constellation of the country's first-generation data-tracking and relay communication satellites. </p>
			<p>The rocket blasted off at 11:53 pm from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center and sent the Tianlian-1 05 satellite into a geostationary orbit, according to China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp (CAST), the giant state-owned aerospace contractor.</p>
			<p>The new satellite will join forces with the Tianlian-1 01, 02, 03, 04 and Tianlian-2 01 satellites, operating together to provide communications coverage for Chinese spacecraft, and making China the second country to have a global relay satellite system after the US.</p>
			<p>A space tracking system insider told the Global Times on Tuesday that the latest Tianlian-1 satellite will fly to a fixed service point by next Tuesday, before it moves to the testing stage.</p>
			<p>Tianlian-1 05 was developed by the CAST, which is affiliated with the China Aerospace Science And Technology Corporation (CASC), and it will maintain the integrity of China's first-generation relay satellite system to ensure that the coverage and service capabilities of the system do not decline and will provide data relay, measurement and control information transmission and orbit determination services for spacecraft and other related platforms. </p>
			<p>The CASC told the Global Times in a statement on Wednesday that the new satellite is the fifth of the Tianlian-1 family, the country's first-generation data-tracking and relay satellite network.</p>
			<p>The development of the constellation started in 2003, and on April 25, 2008, China launched the first Tianlian-1 satellite, filling a gap in the field of data relay and space-borne spacecraft tracking and control, according to the CAST.</p>
			<p>China launched the Tianlian-1 02 and 03 satellites on July 11, 2011 and July 25, 2012, respectively, and the three Tianlian-1 satellites formed a three-star global network. </p>
			<p>The Tianlian-1 system increased the communication service coverage for China's manned spacecraft from less than 20 percent to more than 98 percent. </p>
			<p>The Tianlian-1 04 satellite was launched on November 22, 2016, which further enhanced the system's stability and integrity. </p>
			<p>The Tianlian constellation has provided coverage for every Chinese manned spaceflight since the Shenzhou 7 mission in 2008.</p>
			<p>Global Times reporters have learned from China's space authorities that the Tianlian constellation has played a key role in the country's flagship space projects in recent years, such as its first interplanetary mission of the Tianwen-1 Mars probe, and the latest ground-space communications for taikonauts in the Tianhe space station core module. </p>
			<p>&quot;Since being put into use, the system has provided space-borne data-tracking and relay communications service for China's manned space projects, space station missions, spacecraft at low- and medium-altitude orbits as well as carrier rockets,&quot; the CASC told the Global Times in the statement.</p>
			<p>It constitutes a space information transmission hub and lays the ground for the development of China's space-borne space-tracking system, space analysts said.</p>
			<p>The Long March-3A rocket family, developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, has launched all the Tianlian satellites and sent them into their designated orbits. <br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/07/singapore-proposes-strengthened-copyright-regime/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Singapore&rsquo;s Ministry of Law (MinLaw) has tabled the Copyright Bill for First Reading in Parliament.</p>
			<p>The Bill seeks to repeal and replace the current Copyright Act. It will strengthen the copyright regime in Singapore, by updating the Copyright Act to stay abreast of changes in how content is created, distributed, and used. It will also make the law more accessible by simplifying the language.</p>
			<p>The key features of the Bill are:<br>
				1.It will introduce new rights and remedies for creators, to ensure copyright continues to reward the creation of works and incentivise creativity. For example: 1.A new right to be identified will require users to ensure that when materials are used in public, including when they are distributed on online, the creator or performer is acknowledged. This will help individual creators and performers build their reputation.<br>
				2.Creators of photographs, portraits, engravings, sound recordings and films, whether commissioned or otherwise, will by default be the first owner of copyright unless otherwise prescribed by contract. This changes the current position, where the commissioning party owns the copyright by default. Creators will be better positioned to negotiate with the commissioning parties, and can further showcase and commercialise their works for other purposes.</p>
			<p>2.It will create new exceptions to copyright owners&rsquo; rights, known as &ldquo;permitted uses&rdquo; to ensure copyright works are reasonably available for the benefit of society and to support innovation. For example: 1.Copyright works, if lawfully accessed (e.g., without circumventing paywalls), can be used for computational data analysis, such as sentiment analysis, text and data mining, or training machine learning, without having to seek the permission of each copyright owner. This will support research and innovation efforts.<br>
				2.Teachers and students may use freely available internet materials in their educational activities, including for home-based learning, as long as they acknowledge the source. However, if they are made aware that the source is infringing, they must stop using it. This new exception is timely, since the use of online materials for educational purposes has increased substantially.</p>
			<p>The Bill will restructure and reword the legislation in plain English, to enhance its clarity and accessibility. The Bill adopts a more intuitive, thematic structure and provides illustrations to show how provisions should be applied in particular situations. This will allow creators, users, and intermediaries to better understand how the law works to both protect and provide access to works.</p>
			<p>If passed, MinLaw expects to be able to operationalise most of the provisions in the Bill in November 2021.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We deplore the fact that the illicit broadcasts of SatCon continue despite numerous complaints and the successive judicial and administrative condemnations made by the Gabonese authorities&rdquo; they state.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Together, let&rsquo;s work to advance the rule of law and strengthen the legitimate economy in Gabon,&rdquo; they conclude.<br>

			<p><b><i>Is Foxtel Set To Be Floated As Kayo Subs Surge<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.channelnews.com.au/is-foxtel-set-to-be-floated-as-kayo-subs-surge/<br>
			</p>
			<p>They have racked up over a million subscribers for Kayo and demand for their live sports coverage is soaring, now speculation has emerged that the News Corp Telstra owned Foxtel is set to floated.</p>
			<p>The move comes as the market moves to streaming and a new generation of consumers spend up big on content over free to air TV.</p>
			<p>Increased viewing of live NRL and AFL games is driving Foxtel Sport while Kayo has hit the 1 million subscriber mark and Binge 679,000 subscribers (as of March 31) in less than a year.</p>
			<p>According to the Australian Financial Review News Corp and Telstra have invested in a feasibility study to assess the viability of a berth on the ASX boards later this year.</p>
			<p>The company, which is 65 per cent owned by News Corp is a key player in the Australian streaming market with Citi and Bank of America tipped to get the nod should a float go ahead.</p>
			<p>Another option is for the business to be sold outright to an overseas investor who currently owns content assets and is looking to expand their global asset base.</p>
			<p>Last year it was revealed that News Corp and Telstra had rejected a $US2 billion bid for Foxtel from US cable TV veteran Leo Hindery, who runs New York-based media private equity fund InterMedia Partners.</p>
			<p>Sources have told the AFR that an IPO was not imminent &#150; rather the shareholders were actively assessing whether Foxtel&rsquo;s relatively new streaming arms were a strong enough lure to tempt new investors and make the long-mooted float a reality.</p>
			<p>News Corp and Telstra who only have a 35% shareholding have considered an IPO in the past but have walked away from a float that would spread the risk at Foxtel that has cut costs while rationalising their content spend.</p>
			<p>Currently Foxtel is renegotiating the rights to Formula One with Amazon Prime looking at a deal to pick up the global broadcast rights a new competitor.</p>
			<p>Speculation has it that Amazon {Prime has held talks with SBS to get the co rights to the next soccer world cup.</p>
			<p>Foxtel was initially slated to list in 2016 at the time, Goldman Sachs and Citi were in News Corp&rsquo;s tent, while Credit Suisse and UBS were working for Telstra.</p>
			<p>The plans would&rsquo;ve seen News Corp hold a controlling 51 per cent&rsquo;s sake, while Telstra would have sold down to about 20 per cent, leaving 30 per cent for new investors claims the AFR.</p>
			<p>Those plans fell over &#150; and the listing talks took off again as recently as 2019, but once again they were shelved.</p>
			<p>The owners recently wrote down the value of Foxtel by $1.4 billion to $1.3 billion in May last year.</p>
			<p>While nothing is set in stone, Foxtel is clearly hoping this is a case of third time lucky the AFR concluded.<br>

			<p>A subsidiary of Thaicom is the sole bidder for a Thai satellite orbital slot which is due for auction on July 24th.</p>
			<p>TC Space Connect is the bidder, although muSpace which had said it would make a bid failed to submit a proposal by the end of the bid period.</p>
			<p>Thailand&rsquo;s National Broadcasting &amp; Telecommunications Commission is handling the auction with the country&rsquo;s Ministry of Digital Economy &amp; Society (DES).</p>
			<p>There are four packages up for auction although local reports suggest that the auction will now be delayed. A single bidder is hardly conducive to a successful financial outcome.</p>

			</p>
			<p>China successfully sent a data relay satellite into preset orbit from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province on Tuesday.</p>
			<p>The satellite, named Tianlian I-05, atop a Long March-3C rocket, was launched at 11: 53 p.m. Beijing time.</p>
			<p>China's self-developed Tianlian relay satellites are mainly to provide data relay, measurement and control services for China's manned spacecraft, space labs and space stations. They also offer data relay services for the country's medium- and low-Earth orbiting resources satellites, as well as measurement and control support for spacecraft launches.</p>

			<p>The country initiated the Tianlian I relay satellite system project in 2003, and launched its first data relay satellite, the Tianlian I-01, in 2008, which successfully completed the data relay services for the Shenzhou-7 manned mission in the same year.</p>
			<p>The Tianlian I-02, -03 and -04 satellites were launched in 2011, 2012, and 2016 respectively.</p>
			<p>The Tianlian I-05 satellite will operate in a constellation with the four predecessors and the second-generation relay satellite Tianlin II-01.</p>

				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/07/05/netflix-takes-down-pine-gap-in-vietnam-following-complaint-from-authorities/</p>
			<p>Netflix has complied with Vietnamese authorities&rsquo; demand to remove Australian spy drama Pine Gap from the streamer&rsquo;s offering in the country.</p>
			<p>The streamer raised eyebrows in the Southeast Asian country over its depiction of Chinese claims in the South China Sea. The map features briefly in two episodes.</p>
			<p>The map features the controversial &lsquo;nine-dash line&rsquo; &#150; a U-shaped feature of Chinese maps that illustrates its claims to territory in the South China Sea.</p>
			<p>In a statement, Vietnam&rsquo;s Authority of Broadcasting and Electronic Information said: &ldquo;Netflix&rsquo;s violations angered and hurt the feelings of the entire people of Vietnam. This is the third time in a row in the last 12 months that Netflix has been found to distribute movies and TV shows containing content which violate Vietnam&rsquo;s sovereignty.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Netflix issued its own brief statement confirming that it had removed the series: &ldquo;Following a written legal demand from the Vietnamese regulator, we have removed the licensed series, Pine Gap, from Netflix in Vietnam, to comply with local law.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>This is the latest incident of Netflix apparently coming to blows with local regulators in the Southeast Asia region. Earlier this year, Netflix faced threats from India&rsquo;s National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) over its Bombay Begums series.<br>

			</p>
			<p>A new meteorological satellite from China has been pushed into its planned orbit from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China &#151; this occurred on July 5.</p>
			<p>The satellite, Fengyun-3E (FY-3E), was lifted to space by a Long March-4C rocket at 7:28 a.m. (Beijing Time). This was the 377th flight mission of the Long March rocket series, according to the China National Space Administration.</p>
			<p>Equipped with 11 remote sensing payloads, FY-3E will be the world&rsquo;s first meteorological satellite in early morning orbit for civil service, according to the agency. The satellite is designed for an eight year lifespan and will mainly obtain atmospheric temperature, humidity and other meteorological parameters for prediction applications, all to improve China&rsquo;s weather forecasting capabilities.</p>
			<p>The satellite, according to sources, will also monitor global snow and ice coverage, sea surface temperature, natural disasters, and ecology to enable better response to climate change and to prevent and mitigate meteorological disasters. In addition, the satellite will monitor solar and space environments and their effects, as well as ionospheric data to meet the needs of space weather forecasts and supporting services.</p>
			<p>The satellite and rocket were developed by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology and is operated under the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. <br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/06/india-upholds-trai-tariffs/<br>
			</p>
			<p>India&rsquo;s High Court says the government&rsquo;s changes to TV &lsquo;a la carte&rsquo; channel tariffs are fair, although it has ruled against some of the Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) proposals.</p>
			<p>The TRAI proposals were mooted in January last year but faced numerous objections.</p>
			<p>The Bombay High Court ruled that the TRAI, in its new levy, could not charge a maximum retail price (MRP) of any &lsquo;a la carte&rsquo; channel must not exceed a three-time price of the average MRP of a pay channel in the operator&rsquo;s bouquet (or one-third of the highest-priced channel in a bouquet).</p>
			<p>Previously, a sum of Rupees 130 (&euro;1.47) was applicable for all FTA channels and consumers needed to pay more in order to watch additional channels. After the amendments to the broadcast sector tariffs, consumers will pay Rupees 130 as a NCF (Network Capacity Fee) charge, but will be entitled to get 200 channels.</p>
			<p>A divisional bench of Justices Amjad Sayyed and Anuja Prabhudessai passed the judgment on a bunch of petitions filed by several broadcasters, like the Indian Broadcasting Foundation, a representative body of TV broadcasters, the Film and Television Producers Guild of India, Zee Entertainment Ltd and Sony Pictures Network India.<br>

			<p><b><i>BVN partially discontinues satellite and proceeds with fully Dutch NPO programming<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.bvn.tv/changes/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Flemish Minister of Media has decided not to renew the partnership with BVN.<br>
				VRT offering for Flemish citizens abroad fully digital as from 1 July.</p>
			<p>Publication 6 April 2021</p>
			<p>In view of a new digital strategy, the Flemish Minister of Media (Benjamin Dalle) has indicated that he does not wish to renew the partnership with BVN broadcaster after 1 July 2021. As a result, as from 1 July 2021, BVN will become a 100% Dutch broadcaster with more room for programmes of NPO, the Dutch public service broadcaster. BVN will continue to be available around the world online and largely via satellite. The termination of the partnership between Flanders and BVN will, however, partially affect the satellite distribution, as well as the VRT programme offering on BVN.</p>
			<p>Satellite distribution via Eutelsat 113WA and Astra 19.2 continues:<br>
				BVN will still be available in the overseas territories belonging to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, but also elsewhere in Central and South America and a large part of the United States via the Eutelsat 113WA satellite. Furthermore, BVN will continue to be available via the Astra 19.2 satellite throughout Europe and the neighbouring territories in North Africa and South-West Asia. The &ldquo;reception page&rdquo; shows, by way of footprints, the exact areas where these satellites can be received.</p>
			<p>Up till now, the high costs of satellite distribution could be shared with Flanders, but as the Flemish financial contribution will be discontinued, we will, unfortunately, be forced to cut back on several expensive satellite contracts. Some of you may already experience the impact thereof from 1 May 2021.</p>
			<p>When choosing what satellites can be continued based on a smaller budget, we have decided, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, to give priority to the overseas territories belonging to the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In addition, it has been opted to maintain satellite coverage in Europe, where most Dutch emigrants live.</p>
			<p>The following satellites will stop transmitting BVN in the short term:</p>
			<p>    SES-5 (in Central and Southern Africa) as from 1 May 2021<br>
				    AsiaSat 5 (in Asia) as from 1 July 2021<br>
				    Optus D2 (in Oceania) as from 1 July 2021<br>
				    Galaxy 19 (in Canada, United States and Central America) as from 1 July 2021<br>
				    Multichoice/DStv (in Southern Africa) as from 1 November 2021.</p>
			<p>If you watch via the Galaxy 19 satellite, your location may offer BVN via the Eutelsat 113WA. You can check the exact reception area of the Eutelsat in this footprint.</p>
			<p>BVN via cable:<br>
				If you watch BVN via cable, and your cable provider receives the BVN signal through one of the satellites that are discontinued, your cable provider will most likely not be able to continue to transmit BVN.</p>
			<p> BVN worldwide online:<br>
				The BVN TV channel is offered online around the world, free of charge. This means that you do not have to pay any subscription fees or to log in. You can find the BVN livestream at www.bvn.tv/bvnlive. Or download the free BVN app for Android and iOS.</p>
			<p>VRT programmes on BVN until 1 July 2021:<br>
				The VRT programmes will continue to be part of the BVN programming until 1 July 2021.  After that, Flemish citizens abroad can watch and listen to the VRT offering via VRT NU, VRT NWS, and the VRT radio apps. Flemish TV viewers within Europe who still wish to watch the VRT offering via satellite can take out a subscription from TV Vlaanderen.</p>
			<p>For more information on this subject, go to https://www.vrt.be/nl/aanbod/kijk-en-luister/kijk-en-luister-buiten-vlaanderen/.</p>
			<p>Just as all Dutch-language viewers around the world, Flemish TV viewers can continue to watch the NPO programmes via the BVN website and app (free, no login or subscription required).</p>
			<p>We regret that the BVN service will be reduced. We realize that the internet quality is not sufficient everywhere in the world to be able to view BVN online, so that some of you may have no, or insufficient, access to BVN once the satellites are discontinued. We wish to express our thanks to those viewers for their loyalty.<br>

			<p><i><b>Southland space programme taking off under Robin McNeill<br>
					</b></i><br>
				From https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/125654595/southland-space-programme-taking-off-under-robin-mcneill<br>
			</p>
			<p>Great South space operations general manager Robin McNeill has had a fascination with space since he was a youngster.</p>
			<p>When Robin McNeill was about six-years-old his best mate&rsquo;s father provided radio communications for an early manned space flight, and several years later, in 1969, the youngster watched the moon landing on a scratchy black and white television set.</p>
			<p>It set the scene for a lifelong fascination in space which he has made a career of from Southland.</p>
			<p>McNeill, who has been appointed general manager of Great South&rsquo;s space operations programme, became an engineer and a telecommunications specialist, first becoming involved with satellite ground stations in 1991.</p>
			<p>Then in 2004, he established New Zealand&rsquo;s only commercial low earth orbit satellite ground station at Awarua, near Bluff.</p>
			<p>The satellite station has large antennas which send information to the satellites passing overhead [at between 400km and 800km high] and they also download information from the satellites.</p>
			<p>That information passes through the Awarua station, &ldquo;to the internet and onto our customers, the people who own the satellites,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>McNeill said it was exciting times ahead for the programme, with Great South&rsquo;s board giving his team the mandate to &ldquo;really drive space&rdquo;, following &ldquo;benign neglect&rdquo; a couple of years back.</p>
			<p>The space programme, which has shifted to new offices in Invercargill, was increasing its antenna numbers at Awarua from 9 to 15 by the end of 2021, it was recruiting two more engineers and it planned to build another ground station in the far north.</p>
			<p>Great South chief executive Graham Budd confirmed its space programme, which also helps with University of Canterbury small rocket launches, was facing exciting times.</p>
			<p>And he was delighted McNeill had been appointed its general manager.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It takes vision and tenacity to see a project of this magnitude develop so far.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>McNeill said he got a buzz from supporting young people into space engineering careers.</p>
			<p>Having had a strong interest in space and telecommunications since his early days, his own career choice had been an easy one.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Having antennas and radios that talk to spacecraft, it&rsquo;s the best of both worlds.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>OneWeb adds another 36 to fleet <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/02/oneweb-adds-another-36-to-fleet/<br>
			</p>
			<p>A successful launch by an Arianespace Soyuz rocket placed 36 OneWeb broadband-by-satellite craft into orbit on July 1st.</p>
			<p>The launch, OneWeb Flight 8, from the Russian Far East cosmodrome at Vostochny was a complete success. Launch was at 12.48 UTC.</p>
			<p>The launch means that initial OneWeb connectivity to the planet&rsquo;s norther latitudes can commence shortly helped by a fleet size now of 254 craft. This fleet size is enough to start services this autumn.</p>
			<p>Sunil Mittal, founder and chairman at Bharti Enterprises, speaking on CNBC&rsquo;s Squawk on the Street segment on June 30th, and addressing the extra $500 million that Bharti is putting into OneWeb, said that there were other investors &ldquo;knocking very hard&rdquo; on the company&rsquo;s doors; &ldquo;But remember we are now fully funded, and with no debt. We are secure and set to do exactly what we want to do.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Mittel was asked how OneWeb was managing to keep costs down when compared to Elon Musk&rsquo;s recent comments that it might take $20 billion-$30 billion to achieve its constellation. Mittal said the fundamental difference was one of satellite orbits, commenting: &ldquo;We are at 1200 kms. Elon&rsquo;s are at 450 kms. The closer you [are] to the Earth the more satellites you need and it is a very long margin. Our 648 satellites [compare with] Elon needs 6000-7000 just to do the same job.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He added that Bharti, operating over 17 countries with terrestrial coverage, achieved this coverage with more than 250,000 cell-sites and towers. Mittel said: &ldquo;With just 648 satellites which are our towers in space, we cover the whole globe. It makes a very powerful proposition. We could never achieve this with conventional terrestrial coverage. This coverage, when extended to maritime and aircraft and overall a considerable interest in what we are doing.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Forecast: 24,700 satellites to be launched by 2030 <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/02/forecast-24700-satellites-to-be-launched-by-2030/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Northern Sky Research (NSR) in its latest analysis says that, during the current decade, satellite manufacturing will see some 24,700 satellites launched into orbit. This forecast includes commitments from the proposed mega-constellations.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Upcoming deadlines for international regulatory filings, strong investments from public and private investors, and the associated capacity influx by Non-Geostationary High Throughput Satellites will drive significant orders and launches through 2030,&rdquo; says NSR.</p>
			<p>The report includes examinations from the major satellite operators such as SES, Intelsat, Eutelsat and Telesat. But it also embraces mega-constellations as well as dozens of new entrants to the satellite industry.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;With several ambitious and well-funded programmes aiming to meet international deadlines under immense financial pressures, constellations will drive satellite manufacturing and launch volumes,&rdquo; states NSR Principal Analyst and report lead author, Dallas Kasaboski. &ldquo;While larger GEO satellites take on more complexity via software-defined and multi-mission payloads, other applications, like In-Orbit Servicing (IoS), Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and IoT drive additional market growth.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The demand for new types of spacecraft and services in-orbit is increasing,&rdquo; adds NSR Analyst and co-author Hussain Bokhari. &ldquo;The drive for SSA continues, focusing on protection of assets via more satellites for Gov/Mil customers. Meanwhile, research and development satellites will help smaller players enter the market.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Astro Ultra Box users can now watch Live TV without a satellite connection<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://soyacincau.com/2021/07/04/astro-ultra-box-continuous-viewing-switch-satellite-to-iptv-mode/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The biggest complaint about Astro is that the viewing experience can be easily affected by bad weather. That&rsquo;s just how satellite works and recently the service was also disrupted due to issues on MEASAT-3. To minimise interruptions to your viewing experience, Astro has rolled out an update where you can continue to watch your TV shows when the satellite service is not available.</p>
			<p>Astro Continuous Viewing Mode IPTV</p>
			<p>According to Astro, the new Ultra Box has been upgraded with Continuous Viewing which allows you to switch from live satellite TV to internet streaming. For this to work, your Ultra Box must be connected to your home&rsquo;s WiFi and you would probably need at least 30Mbps for an optimal experience. The Continuous Viewing feature will also be rolling out for the Ulti Box soon.</p>
			<p>As shown in the official video, you can switch to IP viewing by pressing the OK button on the remote when you see the error message. The switchover will take not more than 1 minute.</p>
			<p>Astro switch Satellite Live TV to IPTV</p>
			<p>In Continuous Viewing mode, you are also given the option to play the programme right from the beginning so that you won&rsquo;t miss any action. When the satellite connection is restored, you can switch back to Live TV mode.</p>
			<p>Astro has also started a trial for its Ultra Plug &amp; Play Box which doesn&rsquo;t require a satellite dish. All you&rsquo;ll need is an internet connection of at least 30Mbps and you can set it up yourself once the box arrives at your doorstep.</p>
			<p>The current MEASAT-3 issue hasn&rsquo;t been resolved yet and it requires more time to restore full services. According to the MCMC, the issue was caused by a positioning issue which is likely due to a thruster failure on the satellite. MEASAT-3 is about 15 years old and it will soon be replaced by a newer MEASAT-3d satellite that&rsquo;s launching next year. <br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/07/02/intelsat-apac-leads-pay-tv-revenues/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Intelsat&rsquo;s Media Market Watch states that traditional pay-TV viewing in the Asia-Pacific region is &ldquo;leading the way&rdquo; in revenue generation for operators.</p>
			<p>Intelsat&rsquo;s study (via AVIA and S&amp;P Global) states that it is the largest pay-TV region in the world with 17 key markets and some 655 million subscribers.</p>
			<p>It states that Multichannel cable households make up roughly 58 per cent of the market, and over the next 10 years, cable is expected to maintain its lead in subscribers and revenue. The study says that pay-TV revenue growth between 2025-2029 will be worth $26 billion across all services, with satellite continuing to meet the growing demands of audiences while building revenue and reach for programmers.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Programmers in the region continue to increase their revenue from TV. Meanwhile, the cost of distribution remains low; globally, it&rsquo;s less than 12 cents a day, on average, to distribute one channel to thousands of viewers when using satellite,&rdquo; says the study. &ldquo;By 2024, broadcast TV advertising throughout Asia-Pacific is expected to hit $44 billion, far outpacing online advertising, which is only expected to reach $2 billion (source: AVIA),&rdquo; adds the study.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;While OTT is seeing success in largely urbanised places like Australia and Singapore due to strong broadband penetration, OTT distribution is struggling to keep up with pay-TV in other areas of this region. The reasons for this vary, but reliability and quality are still big stumbling blocks for OTT,&rdquo; says Intelsat.</p>
			<p>The operator specifically mentions its IS-17 craft, which looks after India and has enjoyed growth of 37 per cent year-on-year since launch.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/07/02/dvb-project-sets-requirements-for-next-generation-of-video-codecs/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The DVB project has officially approved the commercial requirements for next generation video codecs.</p>
			<p>The consortium, which provides the global standard for digital television, said that this approval will pave the way for advanced 4K and 8K services. It will now move to investigate the technical compliance of the candidate codecs and develop draft specifications.</p>
			<p>The three candidate codecs that have been initially identified as candidates for inclusion are AV1, AVS3 and VVC. The DVB Project said that the three codecs have the potential to extend the market reach of DVB solutions and bring new features and efficiencies.</p>
			<p>The new codecs are designed to provide greater efficiency and enable an increased UHD service on terrestrial broadcast networks. Said codecs are required to provide a data-rate saving of at least 27% compared to the existing HEVC codec in 4K broadcast applications, and of at least 30% for 4K in broadband applications, and to improve compression efficiency for lower resolutions. </p>
			<p>The requirements include specifications for transport stream delivery and DVB-DASH streaming. It is required that the codec conformance points chosen for broadcast and streaming should be as similar as possible. </p>
			<p>The specification releases are expected during 2022, subject to successfully validating technical and IPR compliance, while the first release of specifications including VVC is expected in early 2022.</p>
			<p>Peter MacAvock, chair of the DVB Project, said: &ldquo;DVB is a pioneer in the development of media distribution systems and it is preparing the way for advanced 4K and 8K systems in the future. The industry is watching our work closely and we are confident that DVB will again break new ground on television technology. We encourage all companies with a stake in this field to join our work.&rdquo;<br>

			<p>BANGKOK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Thai air force's second satellite was successfully launched into space on Thursday, according to Thailand's Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA).</p>
			<p>The Napa-2 earth observation satellite was launched aboard SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida in the United States at 02:31 a.m. local time, the GISTDA announced on its Facebook page.</p>
			<p>The Napa-2 satellite launch followed Napa-1 satellite, the first of the Thai air force, which was successfully launched into space in last September from French Guiana.</p>
			<p>Those satellites were primarily designed to collect data pertaining to Thailand's natural resources, climate, air defense and national security. <br>

			</p>
			<p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk's space company Spacex has launched 88 satellites, as part of the firm's second in-house &quot;ride-share&quot; mission from Florida, bringing the total number of orbital objects this year to nearly 900, the media reported.</p>
			<p>The company launched the satellites on Wednesday on a reused Falcon 9 rocket for the &quot;Transporter-2&quot; mission, including the first five for a new Pentagon agency and dozens more for various companies, countries, and schools, the Verge reported.</p>
			<p>On Wednesday, June 30 at 3:31 p.m. EDT, Falcon 9 launched the Transporter-2, SpaceX's second dedicated SmallSat Rideshare Programme mission, from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, the company said.</p>
			<p>The mission also marked SpaceX's second launch to a polar orbit from Florida. This marked the company's 20th launch this year and the eighth flight for the rocket's first stage booster. That booster returned to Earth about 10 minutes later at SpaceX's Landing Zone 1.</p>
			<p>On board this launch were 85 commercial and government spacecraft (including CubeSats, microsats, and orbital transfer vehicles) and three Starlink satellites.</p>
			<p>The Transporter-1 mission, in January this year, set up a new record for most satellites -- it sent up 143 satellites. The Transporter-2 mission, however, launched more mass to orbit overall,the company said.</p>
			<p>The Transporter launches, first announced in 2019, are part of the company's rideshare business model.</p>
			<p>The Transporter-2 mission includes nearly 10 customers, some of whom are launch service providers who are themselves organizing customer payloads -- like Spaceflight, which is launching 36 small satellites on behalf of 14 customers, as well as its electric propulsion vehicle dubbed Sherpa-LTE, the TechCrunch reported.</p>
			<p>It also includes the first satellite launch for space intelligence company Umbra and Loft Orbital's &quot;rideshare&quot; satellites, YAM-2 and YAM-3, each of which are equipped with five independent sensors for separate customers, it added.</p>
			<p>Originally scheduled for June 29, the launch was halted after a rotary aircraft entered the flight zone. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk in a tweet blasted the Federal Aviation Administration's regulations as &quot;broken&quot;.</p>
			<p>&quot;Unfortunately, launch is called off for today, as an aircraft entered the &quot;keep out zone&quot;, which is unreasonably gigantic,&quot; Musk tweeted.</p>
			<p>&quot;There is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization without major regulatory reform. The current regulatory system is broken,&quot;he added.<br>

			</p>
			<p>SpaceX successfully launched 88 small satellites from Florida on Wednesday after postponing the mission Tuesday because of an airplane in the launch area.</p>
			<p>The Falcon 9 rocket on the Transporter-2 rideshare mission lifted off at 3:31 p.m. EDT from Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. SpaceX confirmed all satellites were deployed properly almost 90 minutes after liftoff.</p>
			<p>The first stage of the rocket flew for the eighth time, and returned safely back to a landing zone at the Space Force station about nine minutes after launch.</p>
			<p>Payloads on board include a range of spacecraft that provide communication, navigation, data for science experiments or Earth observation. Three dozen satellites were booked for the mission by Seattle-based Spaceflight, a company that helps arrange rideshare missions.</p>
			<p>Spaceflight itself also is testing a new type of spacecraft, which the company says is the first-ever electric propulsion vehicle, the Sherpa-LTE1. The company's Sherpa spacecraft help other small satellites get to their intended orbit, like a space tugboat -- also known as orbital transfer vehicles.</p>
			<p>The company is working on new types of propulsion for the space tugs to address the many types of activities happening in the space industry, Spaceflight's Phillip Bracken said in an email.</p>
			<p>&quot;The most unique element of Spaceflight's mission is the launch of two different types of Sherpa vehicles, including our first electric propulsion vehicle,&quot; Bracken, vice president of engineering, said. &quot;Any experiences and data from this mission can be used for the next vehicle, and to improve our performance models.&quot;</p>
			<p>Some customers may need more power over a long period of time, so they'd use chemical propulsion. Others need less mass over a shorter period, so electric might be better, he said.</p>
			<p>A customer riding with Spaceflight is British space company In-Space Missions Ltd., which hopes to launch its first satellite, the Faraday Phoenix, after losing its first Faraday spacecraft during the failure of a Rocket Lab launch in July.</p>
			<p>The U.S. Department of Defense has three spacecraft on the launch: Mandrake II, LINCS and POET. They are the first such satellites built and designed by the department's Space Development Agency and are aimed at gathering information on new laser technology to send data to and from spacecraft in orbit.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Launch company Virgin Orbit sent seven satellites into space on Wednesday from a rocket carried by a jet plane over the Pacific Ocean.</p>
			<p>The Cosmic Girl jet, a modified 747, took off at 9:53 a.m. EDT from Mojave Air and Space Port about 90 miles north of Los Angeles.</p>
			<p>Just under an hour later, the LauncherOne rocket dropped from the wing of the jet. Seconds after release, the rocket thrusters fired and launched into orbit. Cameras on the rocket showed blue and white sky becoming black with the Earth in the background.</p>
			<p>It was the second successful orbital mission for California-based Virgin Orbit.</p>
			<p>&quot;She's capable of lifting up to 300 kilograms or 650 pounds to low Earth orbit,&quot; Wade McEroy, chief of staff for Virgin Orbit subsidiary Vox Space, said of the rocket in a live broadcast.</p>
			<p>The first stage of the rocket burns for about three minutes before the second stage fires and carries the payloads for about six minutes.</p>
			<p>On board are four small national security spacecraft for the U.S. Department of Defense, two STORK Earth observation satellites for Poland-based space company SatRevolution and the first small satellite for the Royal Netherlands Air Force, BRIK II, which will provide military communication and navigation.</p>
			<p>Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit plans to livestream the mission, which is named Tubular Bells Part One after his company Virgin Records' first album, Tubular Bells in 1973.<br>

			<p><b><i>Gilmour Space rockets ahead with $61M AUD Series C funding<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Gilmour_Space_rockets_ahead_with_61M_AUD_Series_C_funding_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>Australia's leading launch services company, Gilmour Space Technologies, has secured $61 million (approximately $47 million USD) from global investors in what is the largest private equity investment raised by a space company in Australia.</p>
			<p>The Series C round, which includes US-based Fine Structure Ventures, Australian venture capital firms Blackbird and Main Sequence, and Australian superannuation funds HESTA, Hostplus, and NGS Super, brings the company's total funds raised to date to $87 million.</p>
			<p>&quot;We are excited to be making our first investment in Australia with Gilmour Space Technologies,&quot; said Brett Rome, lead investor and Managing Partner at Fine Structure Ventures, a venture capital fund affiliated with FMR LLC, the parent company of Fidelity Investments.</p>
			<p>&quot;The team at Gilmour is building the leading sovereign launch company in Australia, and utilising their innovative hybrid rocket engine to efficiently address the growing global demand for putting satellites into orbit,&quot; he noted.</p>
			<p>More rockets, more business</p>
			<p> Since launching its first hybrid rocket in mid 2016, Gilmour Space has achieved a series of significant technology milestones to become a world leader in orbital-class hybrid propulsion technologies that use safer and lower cost fuels than traditional chemical propulsion rockets.</p>
			<p>In recent months, the company has also secured launch contracts with Australian and international customers including US-based Momentus, Sydney-based Space Machines Company, and South Australia's Fleet Space Technologies.</p>
			<p>&quot;It's fantastic to see the global support for our mission to build and launch lower cost rockets and satellites to orbit,&quot; said Gilmour Space CEO and Co-Founder, Adam Gilmour.</p>
			<p>&quot;This new investment will give us runway to launch our first orbital rocket in 2022. It will help us develop multiple Eris vehicles, grow our team from 70 to 120 in the next 12 months, build our sovereign space manufacturing capability for rockets and satellites, and facilitate a commercial spaceport in Queensland, where we hope to launch the world's first hybrid rocket to space,&quot; he added.</p>
			<p>Space for growth</p>
			<p> With over 70 employees in its Gold Coast, Queensland rocket facility and a growing network of 300 partners and suppliers, Gilmour Space is defining space manufacturing in Australia.</p>
			<p>Said Rick Baker, the Blackbird Ventures partner who led Gilmour Space's first $5 million Series A round in 2017: &quot;It's been amazing to see what Gilmour Space has achieved so far in proving that they can build a reliable hybrid rocket engine capable of powering the next generation of launch vehicles.&quot;</p>
			<p>Martin Duursma, the partner at Main Sequence (a deep tech investment fund founded by CSIRO) who led the company's $19 million Series B in 2018, added: &quot;The Australian space industry is attracting significant investment, and Gilmour Space is leading the way. They are hiring, training, and building a new supply chain that is driving capabilities at scale across the whole space sector.&quot;</p>
			<p>Indeed, their progress has attracted some of Australia's largest superannuation funds.</p>
			<p>For HESTA CIO Sonya Sawtell-Rickson: &quot;This is a great example of how we're investing to support visionary businesses take that next step in their growth and development. Gilmour Space is going where no Australian business has gone before, which can open up exciting new opportunities for high-tech industries and jobs in Australia, while helping to grow our members' retirement savings.&quot;</p>
			<p>Hostplus CEO, David Elia, said: &quot;Hostplus' investment strategy is long-term focused, which is why we invest in Australian companies that develop life-changing technologies and innovations that will provide enduring economic and societal benefits. This unique investment presents potential strategic benefits as we anticipate Gilmour's valuation increasing, and we are delighted to support the exciting future ahead for Australia's space industry.&quot;</p>
			<p>All Orbits, All Planets</p>
			<p> &quot;My brother James and I started the rocket program in 2015 with the goal of one day sending humans to space. We always knew it would be a difficult journey, but it makes me proud to think that our ambition and progress have contributed to the tremendous growth of Australia's new space industry,&quot; said Mr Gilmour.</p>
			<p>&quot;Today, we are growing an amazing team committed to providing affordable and reliable satellites and rocket launches to our global customers. We're backed by top investors, and we are proud to be supporting some of the world's most innovative space companies as they look to create significant and positive outcomes for humanity.&quot;<br>

			<p><b><i>NBTC urged to delay upcoming auction<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2141331/nbtc-urged-to-delay-upcoming-auction<br>
			</p>
			<p>Two bidders in the running insufficient</p>
			<p>The Digital Economy and Society (DES) Ministry has suggested the telecom regulator postpone the auction of the satellite orbital slots slated for July 24, saying the bidding, which involves various slots, still needs thorough and prudent consideration to ensure optimum benefit for the country.</p>
			<p>This crucial auction should be held after the new members of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) board are appointed, said DES minister Chaiwut Thanakamanusorn. The recruitment of the new NBTC board members is now underway.</p>
			<p>The auction of the four satellite orbital slot packages by the NBTC is a momentous event that marks the transition of the country's satellite sector from a concession model to a real licensing regime.</p>
			<p>There are four slot packages up for auction. The first consists of 50.5&deg;East and 51&deg;E slots with a reserve price of 677 million baht; the second is 78.5&deg;E with a reserve price of 366.4 million baht; the third involves 119.5&deg;E and 120&deg;E at 393 million baht; and the last is for 126&deg;E and 142&deg;E for 364.6 million.</p>
			<p>Mr Chaiwut said the auction involves many slots, including 119.5&deg;E and 78.5&deg;E, both of which are still occupied under the DES Ministry's concession. The former is currently being used by the Thaicom 4 satellite and the latter was earlier used by Thaicom 5 satellite, which has been deorbited.</p>
			<p>&quot;The ministry urges the NBTC to suspend the planned auction for a certain period. However, this is up to the NBTC as it is an independent organisation under the constitution,&quot; Mr Chaiwut said.</p>
			<p>SET-listed satellite service provider Thaicom is now operating the Thaicom 4 broadband satellite and Thaicom 6 broadcasting satellite -- both of which will have to be handed over to the DES Ministry after its concession ends in September.</p>
			<p>Digital Economy and Society (DES) Minister Chaiwut Thanakhamanusorn.</p>
			<p>Previously, the DES Ministry had assigned CAT Telecom to look after Thaicom's 4 and 6 satellites after the concession ends but that responsibility currently belongs to NT, which was formed through the merger of CAT and TOT in January.</p>
			<p>Mr Chaiwut said NT did not buy a bid document to join the auction but it is still premature to say whether it would participate in the future if the auction is pushed back.</p>
			<p>In global practice, a state can keep some orbital slots for state purposes such as those to be used in national security, he said.</p>
			<p>Only two firms bought a bid envelope to compete in the July 24 auction.</p>
			<p>They are TC Space Connect, a subsidiary of Thaicom, and mu Space and Advanced Technology, a local satellite and space tech firm.</p>
			<p>Mr Chaiwut said the upcoming auction is being seen as less attractive with only two bidders.</p>
			<p>Thaicom chief executive Anant Kaewruamvongs said the company held talks with the ministry last month about the expiry of its satellite-operating concession in September. The state should have a clear strategy for what to do next to ensure optimum benefit for the country, he noted.</p>
			<p>Air Marshal Thanapant Raicharoen, deputy secretary-general of the NBTC, said his office has not received a notification from the DES Ministry about its request for the deferral of the auction.</p>
			<p>But this matter could be considered by the NBTC's board next Wednesday, he said.</p>
			<p>A source at the NBTC who requested anonymity said the two bidders are likely to bid for two out of four packages to ensure they get at least one.</p>
			<p>The source said 119.5&deg;E in the third package is the most sought-after, followed by 78.5&deg;E in the second package and 50.5&deg;E in the first, respectively.</p>
			<p>The NBTC will hold a meeting on what to do next if some packages are not acquired in the bid, said the source.</p>
			<p>A new auction, if required, must be brought up for public hearing and approved by the NBTC board.</p>
			<p>The two firms will have to submit their bid request on July 5 and place a guarantee deposit based on the number of packages they will bid for.</p>
			<p>If a company wants to bid for one package, it has to deposit 67.7 million baht -- calculated from 10% of the reserve price of the package with the highest reserve price or the first.</p>
			<p>A company that wants to bid for two packages will have to deposit 106.9 million baht based on the calculation from 10% of the first package's reserve price plus 10% of the reserve price of the package with the second-highest price or the third package.</p>
			<p>The source said 119.5&deg;E slot in the third package will be most in-demand among bidders, particularly Thaicom as its Thaicom 4 broadband satellite currently uses the slot for operation.<br>

			<p><b><i>Spark Sport win rights to another significant international competition, blow for Sky Television<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/spark-sport-win-rights-to-another-significant-international-competition-blow-for-sky-television/6O4JPDCKAKPI5KMAECAOI3XNEU/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Spark Sport has added another significant layer to their international football offering, securing the UEFA Champions League for the next three seasons.</p>
			<p>The deal also includes the UEFA Europa League and the new UEFA Conference League.</p>
			<p>The Champions League is seen as the world's most prestigious annual football competition, with all of the super clubs across Europe involved.</p>
			<p>Chelsea won the most recent edition last May, beating fellow English club Manchester City in the final. The 2021-2022 competition kicks off in August, with the Europa League the following month.</p>
			<p>The move by the telecommunications company will be viewed as another blow to Sky Television, who have screened the Champions League (and other European club competitions) for most of the last three decades.</p>
			<p>It will also mean the digital platform has built an impressive football stable.</p>
			<p>Spark Sport have had the rights to the English Premier League since the 2019-2020 season, which is the biggest and most popular domestic football competition in the world. They also have the club platforms of Manchester United and Liverpool, the women's Super League and Copa America.</p>
			<p>Sky's football offering is built around the Wellington Phoenix and the A League.</p>
			<p>The pay-television operator also has the FIFA World Cup, the FIFA Women's World Cup and the European Championships (currently screening), though those are quadrennial events.</p>
			<p>Spark's move underlines the competitive nature of the sports rights market in the country, which was a virtual monopoly until a few years ago.</p>
			<p>They recently grabbed the Rugby League World Cup rights &#150; which had been a Sky property since 2000 &#150; though Sky followed up days later by extending their NRL rights until 2027.</p>
			<p>&quot;We are incredibly happy to be bringing New Zealand football fans the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League on top of our current football line-up of Premier League, women's Super League, Copa Am&eacute;rica, MUTV and Liverpool TV,&quot; said Head of Spark Sport Jeff Latch</p>
			<p>&quot;Our content library has become more extensive as international rights holders look for providers who deliver to the growing demand in streaming. Our platform delivers to this changing broadcasting landscape.&quot;</p>
			<p>Spark Sport will also stream a range of highlight and review shows, alongside clips of the best action.</p>
			<p>Since it's launch just over two years ago. Spark Sport has made an undeniable impact in the market.</p>
			<p>The digital platform now holds shared or exclusive content from Formula One, World Rally, Moto GP, NBA, NFL, WTA tennis, UFC and World Athletics Diamond League among other properties while locally they also scored the rights to New Zealand cricket, which is the big fish in their portfolio.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/29/astros-measat-3-still-suffering/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Measat is still experiencing issues with its Measat-3 craft according to local reports. Even though core DTH services were restored on June 24th (having gone dark on June 21st), Measat said it needed more time to fully stabilise the satellite&rsquo;s signals.</p>
			<p>The Malaysian Communications &amp; Multimedia Commission (MCMC) says the problem was understood to be a malfunctioning thruster on the craft. Measat-3 is some 15 years old and was launched in 2006, having been built by Boeing.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Although the exact cause of the incident is still unknown, initial investigation found that there was a thruster failure. To solve that, back-up thrusters have been used to control the satellite without any impact on the operation and lifespan of the satellite,&rdquo; the MCMC statement said.</p>
			<p>Malaysian DTH operator Astro offered its customers a free two-week access to 39 channels as compensation for the outage.<br>

			<p><b><i>Musk says may need $30 bln to keep Starlink in orbit<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-musk-ready-invest-much-162213065.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>BARCELONA, June 29 (Reuters) - Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk said on Tuesday that his Starlink satellite internet venture was growing quickly as he forecast total investment costs in the business at between $20 billion and $30 billion.</p>
			<p>Without disclosing details, he also said Starlink has &quot;two quite significant partnerships with major country telcos&quot; that could help the SpaceX division plug gaps in fifth-generation mobile and cellular networks.</p>
			<p>The Tesla Inc CEO and founder of SpaceX, a rocket ship venture that seeks to colonise Mars, said investment costs before Starlink achieves fully positive cash flow would be $5-$10 billion.</p>
			<p>&quot;It's a lot, basically,&quot; Musk said in a video interview from California with the Mobile World Congress, the telecoms industry's largest annual gathering, which is being held in Barcelona.</p>
			<p>Starlink, an array of low-orbit satellites offering high-speed, low-latency connectivity, is already offering a trial service and aims to cover the world, except for the north and south poles, starting in August, Musk said.</p>
			<p>It has more than 1,500 satellites aloft and is operating in about a dozen countries, adding more every month. Musk forecast total customer numbers would reach half a million over the next 12 months, from 69,000 now.</p>
			<p>Some analysts question whether satellite internet can be a viable business model because it mainly targets remote areas, where there may not be enough people able to pay the high tariffs needed to recoup the investment costs.</p>
			<p>Starlink would need a few million subscribers paying about $99 a month each to recoup a $5 billion investment in a year's time, said analyst Tim Farrar, president of TMF Associates.</p>
			<p>A $30 billion investment over a decade would not require a dramatic rise in subscribers, but to achieve Musk's 2020 projection of roughly $30 billion revenue a year would require tens of millions of subscribers, he said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It is not implausible to get this number (a few million) to make the system not to go bankrupt. But this is not enough to justify the valuation of SpaceX,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The more Elon talks up that he is going to invest tens of billions, the harder it becomes for other people. Obviously, that&rsquo;s the big part of Musk&rsquo;s objective: to limit competition.&quot;</p>
			<p>Starlink faces competition from Amazon.com Inc subsidiary Kuiper, OneWeb - a collapsed satellite operator rescued by the British government and India's Bharti Group, as well as Telesat and a number of others.</p>
			<p>Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said Starlink needed scale which would lower costs: &quot;hence the need to partner with telcos.&quot;</p>
			<p>PARTNERSHIP</p>
			<p>Musk said he was talking to possible partners as a number of countries require operators to provide rural coverage as conditions of their 5G licences.</p>
			<p>He also said if telecom operators have cellular stations in remote regions, they can use Starlink to allow them to connect to core networks.</p>
			<p>The rapid spread of wireless and terrestrial broadband, along with high prices, were significant factors in killing previous low-Earth-orbit satellite ventures.</p>
			<p>Starlink is selling terminals for half price, Musk said, adding he expects to bring down terminal costs from over $1,000 to $300-500 in the next 12 months.</p>
			<p>&quot;If we succeed in not going bankrupt, then that'll be great, and we can move on from there,&quot; he said.<br>

			<p><b><i>Starlink ready for August intro? <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/28/starlink-ready-for-august-intro/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Elon Musk, writing on Twitter on June 25th, said that all 72 orbital planes &#150; that is the route his Starlink satellites take when circling the planet &#150; will be active in August. He added that global coverage will then be activated except for the polar regions which will take a further six months.</p>
			<p>This is a major achievement for Starlink. However, there&rsquo;s no doubting the many would-be subscribers patiently waiting for service to reach them and many complaints from potential users who signed up some six months ago and are still waiting for connectivity.</p>
			<p>Adding to the prospects of an imminent service start were comments made by SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell on June 25th when she said that in six weeks from now we will have full continuous coverage. This would help people who are unserved or underserved to get broadband internet.</p>
			<p>The most recent Starlink launch was on May 26th. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch a batch of Starlink satellites into high-inclination orbits from Vandenberg Air Force base in California in July on an as yet unspecified date.<br>

			<p><b><i>YouTube TV adds 4K and offline downloads at US$20 premium<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/06/29/youtube-tv-adds-4k-and-offline-downloads-at-us20-premium/<br>
			</p>
			<p>YouTube TV, the cord-cutting OTT TV service from Google&rsquo;s video platform of the same name, has introduced 4K viewing and offline downloads.</p>
			<p>The oft-requested features are a part of YouTube TV&rsquo;s new 4K Plus add-on, which will cost users an additional US$19.99 per month. YouTube is running a promotion for early adopters who will get the bolt-on for US$9.99 per month for the first year. </p>
			<p>The add-on also enables &lsquo;unlimited&rsquo; concurrent streams for any device on a user&rsquo;s home network, whereas that would normally be restricted to three devices. The limit still applies for devices outside of the home.</p>
			<p>In a blog post, the company touted the availability of major sports in 4K from networks including NBC and ESPN, along with on-demand content in higher fidelity from FX, Discovery Networks and Tastemade.</p>
			<p>Critics have noted that the cost of the add-on &#150; which includes some features like 4K that are offered by rivals for no additional cost &#150; effectively negates the purpose of the service which has a starting subscription cost of US$64.99 per month. </p>
			<p>Services like YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV were initially pitched as cheaper alternatives to expensive cable packages in the US, but with this addition making the former cost closer to US$100 than US$50, questions of value may begin to emerge. </p>
			<p>Announcing the new tier, chief product officer Neal Mohan said: &ldquo;As a sports fan myself, I&rsquo;ve been really excited about YouTube TV since we launched it a few years ago. YouTube TV not only offers all the content I love, but the team has continued to build new experiences that are changing the way people watch live TV.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Report: 5G in 65 countries <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/29/report-5g-in-65-countries/<br>
			</p>
			<p>According to research from network test, monitoring and assurance solutions provider VIAVI demonstrating the accelerating pace at which 5G is growing, coverage has extended to an additional four countries and 301 cities worldwide since the beginning of 2021.</p>
			<p>The new total &#151; 1,662 cities across 65 countries &#151; represents an increase of more than 20 per cent during 2021 to date, according to the latest edition of the VIAVI report, The State of 5G, now in its fifth year.</p>
			<p>The top three countries that have the most cities with 5G coverage are China at 376, the United States at 284, and the Philippines with 95, overtaking South Korea which is now in fourth position with 85 cities. The APAC region remains in the lead with 641 cities, closely followed by EMEA at 623. The Americas region lags behind at 398 cities.</p>
			<p>With the launch of commercial 5G services in four additional countries &#151; Cyprus, Peru, Russia and Uzbekistan &#151; well over a third of the world&rsquo;s countries now have at least one live 5G network. However, the quality and speed of connectivity can vary significantly from region to region depending on available spectrum.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Although we are seeing a significant jump in the number of networks being rolled out, not all 5G technologies are created equal,&rdquo; suggests Sameh Yamany, Chief Technology Officer, VIAVI. &ldquo;Networks operating in lower, mid and upper band frequencies perform very differently in terms of reach and throughput, increasing the importance of network assurance and optimisation to consistently fulfil the promise of 5G.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.channelnews.com.au/stan-go-to-europe-to-crank-up-sport-offering/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Nine Entertainment owned Stan has won every match of the European UEFA Champions League for $12M, after Sydney start-up Sports Flick&rsquo;s $60 million deal fell over the signing is seen as a &lsquo;filler&rsquo; for Stan who are desperate to get premium sports streaming onto their service.</p>
			<p>The three-year deal between Stan and the Union of European Football Associations allows for key matches, such as the finals, to air on Channel 9, gives the streaming platform rights to every match of the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Europa Conference League and UEFA Youth League as well as rights to the UEFA Super Cup but not the all-important UK Premier League whose rights are held by Optus for the Australian market.</p>
			<p>The new Stan deal was announced on the same day that Foxtel announced a major renewal of their deal with beIN SPORTS which gives them access to Northern Hemisphere Rugby as well as European football and Tennis.</p>
			<p>Stan Sport signed their three-year deal with the Union of European Football Associations who previously had a deal with Optus who refused to pay the sort of money that Sports Flicks was initially offering.</p>
			<p>What emerged was that Sports Flick was unable to get financial guarantees for their offer.</p>
			<p>UEFA contacted rival bidders to resume the process and sources close to the negotiations say Stan came out on top with an offer with Foxtel concentrating on premium sports over fringe overseas sports.</p>
			<p>Stan acting chief executive Martin Kugeler said, &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s multi-year partnership announcement with UEFA reflects Stan&rsquo;s commitment to bringing premium sports to Australian fans&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Stan Sport&rsquo;s UEFA coverage will kick off on August 12 with the UEFA Super Cup match between this year&rsquo;s Champions League winner Chelsea and Europa League winner Villarreal.</p>
			<p>Nine Network claimed that around 1.3 million people watched the Super Rugby final between the Queensland Reds and ACT Brumbies live across Stan Sport, Channel 9, 9GEM and 9Now last month, they failed to reveal how many actually signed up and paid for a Stan subscription.</p>
			<p>Mike Sneesby, the Nine Entertainment CEO and former boss of Stan, last month said Stan Sport was approaching 150,000 active subscribers, with around 75,000 those new to Stan.</p>
			<p>Earlier this month, Optus Sport secured the broadcast rights to the FIFA 2023 Women&rsquo;s World Cup for an estimated $US8million ($10.4 million).</p>
			<p>ChannelNews understands that Stan, Foxtel and Optus are set to do battle shortly for the rights to the English Premier League with a decision set to be made in early 2022.</p>
			<p>In 2015 Optus agreed to pay $63 million a year for the English Premier League, renewing the deal in 2018 for an undisclosed figure.</p>
			<p>Ratings for the English Premier League coverage in Australia have not been revealed.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Freeview On Demand, an app which brought almost all of New Zealand&rsquo;s free to air television channels together, has lost its biggest broadcaster&rsquo;s OnDemand content.</p>
			<p>From Monday, TVNZ will stop providing its catch up programming to Freeview On Demand. TVNZ channels will still be streamed live on the platform.</p>
			<p>The app had been available on smart televisions, as a streaming platform that included shows from TVNZ, Three, M&#x0101;ori Television and RNZ.</p>
			<p>Unlike other streaming services, Freeview On Demand could only be accessed via a smart television.</p>
			<p>TVNZ signalled in December that it would pull out of the collaborative streaming service. From Monday, its exit would be complete and Freeview On Demand would only offer programmes from the other three broadcasters.</p>
			<p>Sky TV&rsquo;s Prime, the other major free-to-air channel, was not involved with Freeview On Demand.</p>
			<p>Of all the local broadcasters, TVNZ has the most extensive and accessible streaming service. In a message to its users, Freeview noted that TVNZ&rsquo;s on demand app could be downloaded to most smart televisions. It was also available on platforms such as Apple TV, Android and IOS.</p>
			<p>TVNZ&rsquo;s main competitors, Three and M&#x0101;ori TV, have relied on Freeview On Demand more &#150; as their streaming apps were available on fewer devices.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;For most viewers, this is a simple change. Their favourite local and international shows will still be available on demand, just accessed on two different apps &#150; Freeview On Demand and TVNZ OnDemand,&rdquo; Freeview said, in a statement.<br>

			</p>
			<p>KUALA LUMPUR (June 27): Additional time would be required to fully complete the complex satellite and signal stabilisation process, said MEASAT Global Berhad (MEASAT) on the MEASAT-3 maintenance update.</p>
			<p>In a statement today, MEASAT said this was following the levels of intermittent service degradation observed during the course of monitoring of the restored satellite services.</p>
			<p>&quot;To ensure all services are fully operational at its optimum level and will be maintained in the long term, we are continuing critical levels of monitoring and maintenance with a full team on duty to ensure that the target performance level is urgently reached and able to be fully maintained.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;MEASAT regrets the inconvenience caused,&rdquo; it said.</p>
			<p>Prior to this, the satellite anomaly detected on MEASAT-3 on Monday was reported to have been resolved and under control since Thursday morning.</p>
			<p>MEASAT is a premium supplier of communication and video services to leading broadcasters, direct-to-home (DTH) platforms and telecom operators.</p>
			<p>With capacity across five communication satellites, MEASAT provides services to over 150 countries representing 80% of the world&rsquo;s population across Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe and Australia.<br>

			<p>SAN FRANCISCO &#150; The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced plans June 25 to move its geostationary weather satellite scheduled to launch in December into an operational role &ldquo;as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>NOAA&rsquo;s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, GOES-T, will replace the GOES-17 satellite in the GOES West position because of problems with the satellite&rsquo;s main instrument, the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), according to a NOAA news release.</p>
			<p>Within months of launching the GOES-17 satellite in 2018, NOAA discovered a blockage in ABI&rsquo;s loop heat pipe that restricted the flow of coolant and caused the instrument to overheat. Engineers were able to mitigate the problems, but the resulting fixes decreased the satellite&rsquo;s lifespan.</p>
			<p>To prevent similar issues with the two remaining satellites in the GOES-R Series, ABI manufacturer L3Harris Technologies redesigned ABI&rsquo;s thermal management system.</p>
			<p>After launch, NOAA will rename the GOES-T satellite GOES-18. Then, the agency plans to spend two weeks ensuring GOES-T systems perform as expected before moving it into an operational role.</p>
			<p>GOES-16 and -17, known as GOES-R and GOES-S prior to launch, are the first two satellites in the four-satellite GOES-R series. NOAA continuously observes the United States, Mexico, Central America, South America, the Caribbean and much of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans with two satellites working in tandem in the GOES East and GOES West orbital slots. The satellites provide extensive data for daily weather forecasts as well as alerts for storms, wildfires, fog and other hazards.<br>

			<p><b><i>Charlie Ergen wants to turn TV business into phone company that competes with the titans<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.ft.com/content/5e8a7d9c-784f-44b2-be9d-fddeddea209d<br>
			</p>
			<p>Charlie Ergen says the move to telecoms is driven by a shift in technology, with cloud providers now able to host all the servers and software capability required to run a network &copy; Robert Galbraith/Reuters</p>
			<p>Charlie Ergen has had designs to turn from TV to mobile mogul for years.</p>
			<p>The billionaire media executive and former professional poker player has spent $25bn over the past decade and a half buying mobile spectrum to turn Dish Network, his satellite pay-TV business, into a phone company capable of competing with the titans of the sector AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile. Eight years ago, he even came close to a $25bn bid for Sprint, which was the third largest network at the time.</p>
			<p>Then earlier this year Dish announced its intention to be the first telecoms company in the world to opt to run its service from the public cloud after striking a deal with Amazon to use its servers to control a new 5G network.</p>
			<p>If it works, it could prove the case for a whole different type of telecoms architecture.</p>
			<p>According to Ergen, Dish&rsquo;s transition into a telecoms company is driven by &ldquo;a paradigm shift in technology&rdquo;, with cloud providers now able to host all the servers and software capability required to run a network.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;That technology is critical. If you&rsquo;re too early, you&rsquo;re roadkill but if you&rsquo;re too late, you miss the window,&rdquo; he told the Financial Times in an interview.</p>
			<p>That has coincided with government pressure on telecoms companies in countries including the US and UK to use smaller equipment suppliers, after China&rsquo;s Huawei was banned from the rollout of new 5G networks on security grounds.</p>
			<p>Dish is working with Nokia but also a long list of US software companies, including Mavenir, Altiostar, Matrixx, Ciena and Palo Alto Networks, to deliver a network that is being viewed as a potential pioneer for &lsquo;open RAN&rsquo; networks around the world.</p>
			<p>&lsquo;Open RAN&rsquo; represents a shift that enables telecoms hardware and software from different providers to work together, rather than relying on one large supplier such as Huawei or Ericsson. That allows smaller and potentially innovative suppliers to break into the 5G market. It has been championed by the US and UK governments as a way to increase competition after the Huawei ban.</p>
			<p>If Dish proves that it can rapidly deploy a new 5G network at a much lower cost &#151; because it will not have to build and run its own data centres &#151; its launch could be a landmark event. &ldquo;To the extent we are successful, others will follow,&rdquo; Ergen said.</p>
			<p>Dish&rsquo;s 5G network will go live in Las Vegas in the third quarter and it started taking customer sign-up requests this month via a website called Project Gene5is, but there are many in the industry that remain sceptical that it will have much impact on a US telecoms market dominated by the three biggest groups.</p>
			<p>The budget of $8bn-$10bn for building a new wireless network seems meagre to some. &ldquo;You might get decent coverage in half of New Jersey for $10bn,&rdquo; said one executive at a rival telecoms company who said that the new 5G network is unlikely to be able to offer widespread coverage outside urban areas for years. That would reduce its appeal to consumers and business customers who need to travel.</p>
			<p>Others noted that Dish is moving into telecoms only months after AT&amp;T reversed its foray into new markets by, among other things, spinning off the satellite company&rsquo;s closest competitor DirecTV.</p>
			<p>For some, the wireless push is fundamental to the survival of Dish. Research group MoffettNathanson argued that Dish&rsquo;s core satellite television business is likely to report &ldquo;rock bottom levels&rdquo; of new customers in the future.</p>
			<p>Even though it is just starting out, &ldquo;It is now fair to say that Dish&rsquo;s core business is wireless rather than satellite TV,&rdquo; the analysts said.</p>
			<p>Ergen argues he has seen off the doubters in the past. Dubbed the most hated man in Hollywood because of his high-stakes battles with content companies he has a fearsome reputation. He outmanoeuvred Rupert Murdoch in 2001, foiling his initial attempts to buy DirecTV. Ergen has also been active in Britain, where he circled satellite rival Inmarsat but pulled out of the bidding at the eleventh hour in 2018.</p>
			<p>He has certainly seen off doubters in the past. His $60,000 satellite TV start-up EchoStar &#151; launched in 1980 by installing &ldquo;big old-fashioned dishes&rdquo; across rural America where reception was non-existent &#151; got him off the ground.</p>
			<p>The launch of consumer digital broadcasting services in 1996 under the Dish (Digital Information Super Highway) brand turned him into a serious media player and gave him a lead over cable companies in the pay-TV market. Dish, now separated from EchoStar, has more than 11m customers and generated $15.5bn of revenue and a $1.8bn net profit in 2020.</p>
			<p>Ergen has also pointed those sceptical of his plans to the steep fines from the US telecoms regulator &#151; as part of conditions attached to its spectrum licences &#151; if it does not build out its mobile network to reach 40 per cent of the US population by June next year and 70 per cent by 2023. He has previously said missing those regulatory milestones would be &ldquo;financial suicide&rdquo; for the company.</p>
			<p>Dish already has a small foothold in the mobile market, having bought the Boost brand from T-Mobile in 2020. Boost&rsquo;s 9m customer base is less than a tenth of its larger rivals but Dish is already ruffling feathers having accused T-Mobile of trying to &ldquo;thwart competition&rdquo; after the larger company moved to shut off an old 3G network used by Boost earlier than expected.</p>
			<p>Even with the power of Amazon behind him, Ergen is not promising the earth. &ldquo;As a fourth player we don&rsquo;t believe we can conquer the world in the short term,&rdquo; he said. He added that there is still ample risk linked to the launch of a network structure that has not been tried before.</p>
			<p>Nonetheless, he believes that his cloud-based network could remake his business. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re building Netflix in the Blockbuster world,&rdquo; he said in his distinctive Tennesseean drawl. &ldquo;This is not our first rodeo.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkeys-5th-generation-communication-satellite-set-to-start-service-165804<br>
			</p>
			<p>Having been launched by technology company SpaceX in January, Turkey's fifth-generation communication satellite Turksat 5A is ready for service at 31 east meridians.</p>
			<p>Turksat will offer TV broadcasting services to Europe, the Middle East, and the Africa region and data communication services to the whole coverage area thanks to Turksat 5A, according to data compiled by Anadolu Agency.</p>
			<p>With Turksat 5A, the number of Turkey's active communication satellites in space reached four alongside Turksat 3A, Turksat 4A, and Turksat 4B.</p>
			<p>The first signal from Turksat 5A was received 35 minutes after it was successfully launched into orbit by a Falcon 9 rocket taking off from the U.S. East Coast.</p>
			<p>Manufactured by Airbus with fully electric propulsion, Turksat 5A traveled over four months in space to reach its orbital slot.</p>
			<p>After completing in-orbit tests, Turksat 5A started its over 30 years of maneuver life while guaranteeing Turkey's frequency and orbit rights.</p>
			<p>The satellite will provide 1728 Mhz of Ku Band capacity over Turkey, Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, Midwest Africa, South Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, the Aegean Sea, and the Black Sea region.</p>
			<p>Planning to expand its satellite fleet, coverage areas, and capacity, Turksat will launch 5B satellites into space in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
			<p>The number of active Turkish satellites in Earth orbit has reached seven, including three observation satellites - G&ouml;kt&uuml;rk-1, G&ouml;kt&uuml;rk-2, and Rasat. <br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/125535172/league-loss-could-weaken-sparks-challenge-to-sky-top-analyst-suggests<br>
			</p>
			<p>Sky TV says securing the winter sport was a &ldquo;priority&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Spark may be less willing to continue to invest in its Spark Sport streaming service after Sky TV secured National Rugby League broadcasting rights until at least 2027, a top analyst says.</p>
			<p>Sky announced on Wednesday that it had renewed its broadcast rights to the code and would work with the NRL to help grow the sport in the country.</p>
			<p>Financial terms were not disclosed.</p>
			<p>The deal leaves few major sports rights still on the table for Sky and Spark to fight over in the near term, though it is understood New Zealand rights to A-League football will soon be in play.</p>
			<p>Jarden analyst Arie Dekker suggested it was possible the outcome could weaken Spark&rsquo;s appetite to continue to bid against Sky for sports rights.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The big question we see for Sky remains around Spark's resolve to continue to try and build a sports media platform in New Zealand, and whether the inability to secure these rights impacts on that resolve,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>Spark Sport could &ldquo;stay in the battle&rdquo; for some time, Dekker said.</p>
			<p>But he did not believe Spark Sport was profitable and said it now faced a reasonable wait before it could make a play for New Zealand's other key winter sporting code, rugby union, given Sky was just one year into a five-year deal for that code.</p>
			<p>Spark Sport announced last week that it had won a tender for rights to the 2021 Rugby League World Cup but NRL could have been a useful tier-1 sport to flesh out its winter line-up.</p>
			<p>Spark has continued to chip away at Sky&rsquo;s sport rights, as eyes now turn a possible A-League tussle.</p>
			<p>Spark spokeswoman Samantha Smith would not comment on the NRL rights, including on whether it was disappointed not to have them.</p>
			<p>Nor would she comment on what it meant for Spark Sport.</p>
			<p>But she said it had &ldquo;a wide variety of tier one content&rdquo; on its platform.</p>
			<p>Sky chief executive Sophie Moloney said it had &ldquo;made it a priority&rdquo; to secure NRL, pointedly describing it as a &ldquo;much-loved winter sport&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;A priority is the strengthening of the women&rsquo;s game and for tamariki and rangatahi throughout Aotearoa,&rdquo; she said.</p>
			<p>Moloney said Sky had committed to making some important matches available free-to-air &ldquo;so as many Kiwis as possible can enjoy the wonderful game&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Sky shares closed up 1.8 per cent at 17.1 cents, while Spark shares closed up 0.5 per cent at $4.77.<br>

			</p>
			<p>KUALA LUMPUR (June 24): Telecommunication and broadcasting services that were disrupted since June 21 following MEASAT-3 satellite technical issues have been restored, said the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).</p>
			<p>MCMC, in a statement today said the satellite has now been put into normal operating mode after overhaul work was carried out.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The transponder has also been reactivated since 9.30am today to allow customers to resume their services and this process is expected to take several hours.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Although the exact cause of the incident is still unknown, initial investigation found that there was a thruster failure. To solve that, back-up thrusters have been used to control the satellite without any impact on the operation and lifespan of the satellite,&rdquo; the statement said.</p>
			<p>According to MCMC, the incident has resulted in disruption to various services such as Direct-to-Home (DTH), distribution of video channels, as well as mobile phone and Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) services.</p>
			<p>The statement said that the public can contact MEASAT if their subscribed services are still affected.</p>
			<p>On June 21, Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd&rsquo;s satellite provider, MEASAT Satellite Systems Sdn Bhd informed that the satellite television service channel had experienced broadcast interruptions, affecting an estimated 14,000 customers.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.ajudaily.com/view/20210624134907761<br>
			</p>
			<p>SEOUL -- The satellite TV and internet service wing of South Korea's top telecom company KT partnered with a state broadcaster to commercialize a marine satellite TV service for customers who use KT's satellite internet service. Vessel operators will be able to watch the real-time broadcasting of a TV channel without having to add an extra satellite dish.</p>
			<p>South Korea's satellite internet services use Koreasat 5, the country's first combined civil and military communications satellite launched into orbit in 2006, to relay radio waves. Conventional satellite TV systems were specifically used for TV content while satellite internet systems focused on providing online access due to slow data transfer speed.</p>
			<p>KT SAT said in a statement on June 24 that the company would work with Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), a state broadcaster, to commercialize the satellite internet-based real-time TV broadcasting service in July. The service has been demonstrated since May 2021.</p>
			<p>&quot;We will start providing a live TV broadcasting service to sea areas outside South Korea,&quot; KT SAT CEO Song Kyung-min was quoted as saying. The company said that ships traveling in any ocean will be able to watch the KBS international TV channel using KT SAT's satellite internet-based TV service.</p>
			<p>Through the new service, KBS World 24, a TV channel for the international audience, will be broadcast live. The channel broadcasts its content including news, talk shows, documentaries and music programs mainly in Korean with English subtitles.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Malaysian pay TV operator Astro has announced a distribution deal with Netflix. </p>
			<p>The deal will give Astro customers access to Netflix on their connected Ultra Boxes, with plans to launch on connected Ulti Boxes in the coming months. </p>
			<p>Astro said that Netflix will be integrated into the Astro platform, but has not revealed the extent to which that will happen, such as whether Netflix content will be integrated into the platform&rsquo;s search facilities. </p>
			<p>Henry Tan, group CEO of Astro said: &ldquo;Our partnership with Netflix consolidates Astro&rsquo;s position as the No.1 entertainment destination for Malaysians by offering the best streaming services alongside our own best-loved originals, vernacular signatures, live sports and local blockbuster movies. Our announcements to date will extend our leadership in delivering the best entertainment experience to Malaysians.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Tony Zameczkowski, Vice President for Business Development APAC, Netflix said, &ldquo;From Hollywood films like Army of the Dead, to top series like La Casa de Papel from Spain, Lupin from France, and great Korean dramas like Vincenzo, we believe that great stories can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere. I&rsquo;m thrilled that our partnership with Astro allows us to bring a world class multi-device entertainment experience to more Malaysians.&rdquo;<br>

				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/06/24/bein-bags-champions-league-in-seven-country-southeast-asia-rights-deal/<br>
			</p>
			<p>While its fate in France remains unclear, beIN Media Group has expanded its presence in Asia by picking up the rights to the UEFA Champions League.</p>
			<p>The Qatar-based beIN has acquired the rights to the Champions League, Europa League, Europa Conference League and UEFA Youth League in seven Asian countries: Hong Kong, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos.</p>
			<p>The broadcaster attributed its success in acquiring the rights to a commitment from UEFA to enforcing anti-piracy measures. BeIN is particularly sensitive on the topic of piracy, having previously been the subject of a years-long state-sponsored piracy campaign dubbed beoutQ.</p>
			<p>In a statement, Mike Kerr, beIN Asia Pacific&rsquo;s managing director, said: &ldquo;BeIN is delighted to renew our valued relationship with Uefa as their club competitions broadcast partner in Asia, complementing our existing rights portfolio of a wide range of premium sports. As the leading pan-regional sports broadcaster in the region, we aim to work alongside our key affiliate partners to grow audiences and provide a compelling sports experience across all screens.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>For UEFA, this deal is a return to a more traditional broadcast deal after it spent the 2020/21 season airing the competitions on its own digital platform. This came after DAZN returned its rights to the competition in a number of Southeast Asian countries as it reconsolidated its business.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Aiming to showcase the scale and opportunity presented by its combined sports offering, multichannel programmer Discovery has unveiled Discovery Sports as a new corporate brand to represent the dedicated group that operates its portfolio of sports brands, channels and platforms.</p>

It highlights Discovery&rsquo;s combined strength in sports media, spanning the scale of the growing discovery+, the leading real-life entertainment streaming service, and its broad free-to-air networks in Europe; the breadth of sports offering through Eurosport in more than 75 markets and 230 million homes; the depth of international super-fan services with Global Cycling Network (GCN), Global Mountain Bike Network (GMBN), Golf Digest and GOLFTV, as well as completing a full 360 offer with its events management and promotion arm, Eurosport Events.  While each of Discovery&rsquo;s consumer facing sports brands will continue to be presented and operate as usual, Discovery Sports will support collaboration within all areas of the combined sports business that Discovery takes to market.</p>
			<p> Andrew Georgiou will lead the full portfolio of Discovery&rsquo;s sports brands and businesses as the President of Sports.

			<p>&ldquo;As we organise all our sports business under Discovery Sport, I am hugely excited to have Andrew lead the charge for this consolidated group. His expertise, strategic vision and strong relationships have steered our sports business through last year&rsquo;s challenging period for live sports, and set us on a course for further transformation and growth going forward,&rdquo; he added.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;When taken together, Discovery&rsquo;s portfolio of sports brands, channels and platforms is unrivalled for its ability to engage audiences however the viewer chooses to watch,&rdquo; said Georgiou. &ldquo;From the scale of Discovery&rsquo;s free-to-air networks, to the breadth of sports offering through Eurosport and the depth of super-fan engagement from GOLFTV, Golf Digest and GCN, taken together Discovery Sport serves passionate fans everywhere and brings limitless opportunities for our brand and rights-holder partners.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;By collaborating as one global team, Discovery presents an unprecedented level of sports media expertise. We bring the only truly 360-degree offer, from platforms to promotion, that can truly grow an event, series or an even entire sport. Together we are able to unlock the power of sport with even greater impact, thanks to inspirational storytelling, best-in-class live coverage and sports journalism.

			<p><b><i>Sky TV secures NRL broadcasting rights through to end of 2027 season<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/league/warriors/125531966/sky-tv-secures-nrl-broadcasting-rights-through-to-end-of-2027-season<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Warriors will remain on Sky TV through to the end of the 2027 season.</p>
			<p>Sky TV has extended its broadcasting rights of the NRL through to the end of the 2027 season, keeping hold of one of its most important assets.</p>
			<p>The current deal runs out at the conclusion of the 2022 season and with Spark Sport announcing last week it had secured exclusive rights for this year&rsquo;s Rugby League World Cup in England, there was speculation they could make further moves into the sport.</p>
			<p>As well as the deal to cover the NRL, the Australian Rugby League Commission and Sky TV have announced they&rsquo;ll work closer with New Zealand Rugby League to help grow the sport in the country.</p>
			<p>Sky chief executive Sophie Moloney said the partnership was more than a broadcast deal.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Through our partnership we have committed to working even more closely with NRL and NZRL to grow the game of rugby league in New Zealand, like the roadshow we have on this weekend in Christchurch with the Warriors and NZRL,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.<br>
				Sky CEO Sophie Moloney says the organisation is committed to growing league in New Zealand.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do everything we can to attract and develop the next generation of league fans and players from grassroots to high performance. It&rsquo;s this which is vital to the future of the game.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We also commit to making some important matches available free-to-access. That way we can ensure as many Kiwis as possible can enjoy the wonderful game of rugby league.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>While almost everything will only be shown on Sky, some games during the Anzac round, Magic round and State of Origin will be shown for free on other networks.</p>
			<p>The opening game of this year&rsquo;s State of Origin series was shown on TV3, as well as on Sky, although the remainder of the series, including Sunday night&rsquo;s game in Brisbane only being shown on Sky.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Stuff understands the State of Origin series is likely to be played over three midweek dates from next season, with the stand-alone weekend for rep footy disappearing.</p>
			<p>This will mean the Kiwis won&rsquo;t be able to play a mid-season test against another nation and all their fixtures will be at the end of the NRL season.</p>
			<p>There are no international fixtures this weekend, because of scheduling difficulties caused by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
			<p>If a test between the Kiwis and Tonga had been organised to be played in New Zealand this weekend, it would have been in significant jeopardy now, because of the pause in the trans Tasman travel bubble between New South Wales and New Zealand over the latest coronavirus outbreak in Sydney.</p>
			<p>The absence of a mid-year test will result in the Kiwis going a considerable amount of time without being together each season, but the NZRL hopes that the change to the NRL schedule means there will be more time for the squad to be together for end of year tests.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/23/invidi-irdeto-addressable-solutions-partnership/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Addressable solutions company INVIDI Technologies and digital platform security specialist Irdeto are rolling out a ready-to-deploy integrated technology for pay-TV operators. Both companies will place an emphasis on the APAC, MENA, Sub-Saharan Africa, and India markets.</p>
			<p>The collaboration enables every television set-top box containing Irdeto&rsquo;s broadcast middleware technology to become instantly addressable, allowing marketers to insert accurately and quickly the right ads to the right targeted audiences at the right times, via INVIDI&rsquo;s cloud-based INVIDI Edge platform.</p>
			<p>The pair say the collaboration allows broadcasters and operators, as well as satellite, cable and linear broadcast MVPDs, to take advantage of addressability technology, thereby increasing ad inventory value and driving new revenue possibilities for ad sales &#150; both with end-to-end measurement and accountability.</p>
			<p>While addressability has been beneficial for the US and European operators for some time, pay-TV operators globally are now looking for revenue streams beyond traditional subscriptions will see this as a welcome opportunity. This partnership clears barriers for operators and moves addressable advertising into an easier &lsquo;express lane&rsquo; for them.</p>
			<p>Previously, an addressable implementation required considerable software development on various types of set-top boxes, deterring investment into this growing space. Pre-integration with platform agnostic Irdeto middleware now enables a faster implementation of targeted advertisement to a global client base.</p>
			<p>INVIDI and Irdeto say they will provide the required operator support for both the technology deployment and business process workflows for maximum revenue benefits.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;For advertisers and buyers, INVIDI provides a unified view of the audience,&rdquo; explains Prasad Sanagavarapu, INVIDI&rsquo;s Senior Vice President, Emerging Markets. &ldquo;For sellers and publishers, this integrated solution yields the quickest route for bringing their inventory to the market.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;At a time when operators face challenges brought by the changing consumer viewing behaviors, targeted advertising offers them a potential for a significant new revenue stream,&rdquo; adds Shane McCarthy, COO of Video Entertainment at Irdeto. &ldquo;Our unique pay-TV operator heritage enables us to understand the challenges they face today and the opportunities tomorrow brings; and we are excited to be working with some of our key customers on the integration of the new easy-to-launch solution.&rdquo;<br>

			<p>New U.S.-Based BOC Creates Opportunities for Creators and Audiences to Accelerate and Streamline Worldwide Delivery of Regional Live Sports and Entertainment Content</p>
			<p>NEW YORK and BURBANK, CA - June 22, 2021 - Telstra Broadcast Services (TBS) expands its presence in the United States with the launch of a new Broadcast Operations Center (BOC) at the PSSI International Teleport in Pittsburgh.</p>
			<p>The BOC &#150; part of an expanded partnership with PSSI Global Services &#150; enables Telstra Broadcast Services to add U.S.-based managed services including operations, monitoring, bookings and technical services to its overall Telstra Global Media Network (GMN) offerings and complements Telstra&rsquo;s existing broadcast operations facilities in London, Hong Kong and Sydney.</p>
			<p>    &ldquo;There is immense global demand for North American content, and the new BOC allows Telstra Broadcast Services to offer North American content providers superior technology and access to international audiences in Europe, Asia and Australia,&rdquo; said Adam Day, Head of Enterprise, Technology and Broadcast Sales, Telstra.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The ability to provide our North American customers with a local operational presence and 24/7 master control room capabilities will provide them a world-class experience and is key to managing their content delivery to Europe and Asia Pacific,&rdquo; continued Day. &ldquo;We believe our partnership with PSSI will reap benefits for content creators and content consumers on a global scale.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The new BOC supports Telstra&rsquo;s ongoing work to seamlessly deliver content worldwide, and the partnership enables opportunities for high-profile broadcast programming, including major sporting and entertainment events, to reach new audiences and expand viewership into more international markets.</p>
			<p>The BOC supports live and recorded broadcast transmissions of news, sports and entertainment content, as well as digital broadcasting and IP video delivery and features a 24/7 facility with a master control room (MCR) for monitoring, bookings, trouble-shooting and delivering connections to major broadcast customers and global teleports.</p>
			<p>PSSI&rsquo;s experience in live event management and transmission, and familiarity with the U.S. sports and entertainment market makes PSSI an ideal fit to support Telstra&rsquo;s delivery of content originating and terminating in North America. The additional services handled through the PSSI facility will help ensure smooth operations during events with PSSI also handling frame rate conversions, encoding, decoding and uplink/downlinks of U.S. content.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This initiative represents a significant expansion of the work we&rsquo;ve been doing together for years,&rdquo; said Jason Land, Vice President, Strategic Television at PSSI. &ldquo;Our event-based approach is the foundation for adding another layer of support and reliability to Telstra&rsquo;s broadcast business, while allowing PSSI to leverage the global GMN network as an &lsquo;in-house&rsquo; solution for our customers.&rdquo;<br>
				Telstra Broadcast Services Continues Growth Trajectory</p>

Known for  its ability to supply live content to production hubs via a low-latency global infrastructure, Telstra enables significant business benefits and greater efficiencies by providing scalable bandwidth at speed, a high-quality network delivery, the simplification and aggregation of multiple tech and a choice of compression options.

				From https://www.satellitetoday.com/broadband/2021/06/22/st-engineering-idirect-solution-deployed-in-the-philippines-with-intelsat-connectivity/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Broadband is deployed in the Philippines with Intelsat and ST Engineering iDirect solutions. </p>
			<p>The ST Engineering iDirect Evolution platform is being deployed in the Philippines with Intelsat&rsquo;s Horizons 3e satellite to expand broadband service across the archipelago. This deployment is through a long-term partnership with a local Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) service provider. </p>
			<p>The Philippines is an island nation and its geography makes it difficult to connect through terrestrial technology. ST Engineering iDirect said the service provider chose the Evolution platform because it required a platform that could deliver reliable broadband internet services despite the scattered location of its customer base and wet weather conditions. The company also said its adaptive Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technology allows remotes to dynamically adapt transmissions to the hub to suit current link conditions, and will allow the service provider to overcome issues with rainfade.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We have invested in our coverage of the region to ensure that even the most remote islands are connected with reliable broadband services. Our footprint, combined with ST Engineering iDirect&rsquo;s innovative ground technology, is enabling more people to benefit from the power and reach of satellite connectivity, resulting in improved services and better opportunities for the population no matter where they&rsquo;re located,&rdquo; commented Terry Bleakley, regional vice president of Asia Pacific Sales for Intelsat.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Malaysian pay TV operator Astro saw its profit after tax and minority interests jump by 91% in its fiscal first quarter, despite flat year-on-year revenues.</p>
			<p>Astro recently launched the Ulti Box to expand its connected home footprint</p>
			<p>The operator turned in profits of MYR141 million (&euro;28.5 million) on revenues of MYR10.6 billion for the three months to April.</p>
			<p>Advertising expenditure was up by 21% to MYR109 million despite the impact of the pandemic.</p>
			<p>Astro has seen strong growth in streaming and in the use of its advanced set-top., with the Astro Go service now registering 1.4 million monthly users and on-demand consumption tripling year-on-year. Astro&rsquo;s bundling strategy has also born fruit, with an 80% lift in broadband customers year-on-year.</p>
			<p>The operator launched a new streaming offering targeting millennials over the period. Sooka provides a free tier and a subscription offering combining sports, local entertainment and exclusive originals.</p>
			<p>Advertising growth outperformed the local market, which grew by 9%, according to Astro. The company attributed growth to its originals strategy but warned that renewed lockdowns would dampen growth, as a new wave of COVID-19 hits south-east Asia.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;FY22 promises to be an action- packed year. We continue to execute on our strategy and in June, we introduced 2 new streaming services: sooka featuring live sports and winning local content for millennials and Disney+ Hotstar with amazing content at an incredible value.

The report states that the controversial Australian billionaire is seeking to reinforce his position in the UK amid declines in newspaper profitability that forced News UK to write down the accounting value of The Sun to zero.</p>
			<p>A deal with BT would also create an entry point into TV following a failed attempt from News UK to launch a far-right news channel. The company already has a significant presence in radio, following its &pound;220 million acquisition of TalkSport-owner Wireless Group in 2017.</p>
			<p>An agreement between Murdoch and BT is far from a done deal however, with bankers from Lazard appointed by the operator to secure a deal. </p>
			<p>The report notes that BT is also in talks with DAZN over a deal which could emulate the sports streamer&rsquo;s partnership with TIM in Italy. BT is also said to be in talks with ITV and Discovery.<br>

			<p><b><i>India: Disney+ has significant lead on Netflix <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/22/india-disneyhas-significant-lead-on-netflix/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Netflix dominates in certain Asia-Pacific (APAC) countries such as Australia and Malaysia, according to the SVoD forecasts by GlobalData, a data and analytics company. However, Netflix has significant ground to gain in India, with sentiments around India down year-on-year in 2021 while Disney+&rsquo;s sentiments are up, reveals the Filing Analytics Platform of GlobalData.</p>
			<p>Rinaldo Pereira, Senior Business Fundamentals Analyst at GlobalData, commented: &ldquo;Despite a year-on-year dip in market share in India during 2020, Netflix&rsquo;s sentiments were much higher than Disney during the year. In 2021, the company&rsquo;s sentiments have dipped and are lower than Disney&rsquo;s. During 2020, Netflix used a free weekend strategy to gain subscriptions in India, and the strategy worked in its favour. Yet, Disney gained more subscribers likely due to its edge in pricing and local content offerings.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Both Netflix and Disney+ have recognised the need to address the domestic market by adjusting price points and driving a mobile-centric strategy. GlobalData expects further growth in Netflix&rsquo;s subscribers in India despite growing competition. However, Disney&rsquo;s Hotstar is likely to remain in the top spot, with net additions likely to plateau in 2022.</p>
			<p>Pereira concluded: &ldquo;Disney seems to be more focused on retaining its top spot in India. The company had twice as many mentions compared to Netflix in 2020. Netflix&rsquo;s India and APAC related mentions peaked in 2018 and have been on the downtrend since. For Disney and Netflix, geopolitics was among the top themes in sentences with India as a mention, in line with the Indian government&rsquo;s new information technology rules in 2021. With Indian consumers unlikely to subscribe to every platform, companies with the right price points and the best local content will make the most of India&rsquo;s booming market.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://news.satnews.com/2021/06/20/green-mp-teanau-tuiono-wants-to-stop-rocket-lab-launching-weapons-into-space-on-behalf-of-foreign-powers/?mohide=true&amp;mc_cid=4bbc7e9a71&amp;mc_eid=e80892f101<br>
			</p>
			<p>Green MP Teanau Tuiono wants to change the law to stop Rocket Lab from launching weapons into space on behalf of foreign powers.</p>
			<p>Tuiono, the Green Party&rsquo;s security and intelligence spokesperson, announced his Member&rsquo;s Bill &#151; legislation proposed by MPs who are not ministers &#151; at a protest outside Rocket Lab&rsquo;s Auckland headquarters on Monday. </p>
			<p>His proposed law change would amend the Outer Space and High Altitude Activities Act and prohibit the launching of military hardware into space from New Zealand. The Bill will only go before Parliament if it&rsquo;s pulled from the ballot box. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;This change would ensure that Aotearoa New Zealand&rsquo;s space industry and its facilities could never be used by military actors to launch weaponry, establishing in legislation an enduring commitment to peaceful conduct in outer space,&rdquo; says Tuiono.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The Government has a responsibility to make sure technologies sent into orbit from New Zealand soil do not assist other countries&rsquo; armies to wage war.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab, a United States-owned but New Zealand-based space company estimated to be worth more than US$1.2 billion, has become a leader in a new market of small rocket services provided by private companies.</p>
			<p>It launches satellites into space for the United States military and private companies from M&#x0101;hia Peninsula, located between Napier and Gisborne.</p>
			<p>Some of the launches, such as one dubbed Gunsmoke-J in March this year on behalf of the U.S. Army&rsquo;s Space and Missile Defense Command, have raised questions about New Zealand&rsquo;s role in assisting with foreign warfare. </p>
			<p>The Gunsmoke-J mission was designed to improve U.S. missile targeting capabilities during combat, which activists from Auckland Peace Action say makes us complicit in U.S. military practices, thereby making New Zealand a military target.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The U.S. military satellites launched by Rocket Lab can control activity such as communications with troops, surveillance and reconnaissance, intercepting information or spying, and targeting weapons, like drones, bombs, and also nuclear weapons,&rdquo; says Auckland Peace Action spokesperson Eliana Darroch. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;If we send these satellites into space with U.S. military capacities, we are complicit in the drone and precision bombings and other acts of warfare which the United States does.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>She says with New Zealand being a proud Nuclear Free country, and being instrumental in the 2017 international treaty banning nuclear weapons, launching satellites capable of controlling nuclear weapons is unacceptable.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The New Zealand Government must immediately suspend Rocket Lab&rsquo;s launches until a public review of the Outer Space and High Altitude Activities Act has taken place.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>It is due for review this year.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It is hypocritical for the New Zealand Government to want peace, yet allow Rocket Lab&rsquo;s military payload launches to continue,&rdquo; says Darroch.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Rocket Lab, with its connections to the Pentagon through its board and investors including a CIA venture capital firm, and Lockheed Martin, is a private company defining New Zealand&rsquo;s foreign relations. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;Rocket Lab is creating links between New Zealand and the U.S. military that the public have not consented to. That is undemocratic and dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Tuiono says the Greens are also conscious of the impact successive rocket launches have on the whenua and moana of M&#x0101;hia. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;When we visited M&#x0101;hia the wh&#x0101;nau told us about the absence of local birds and kaimoana and we continue to support the call from wh&#x0101;nau for independent cultural and environmental impact assessments.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>A Rocket Lab spokesperson told Newshub the company does not launch weapons or payloads that contribute to weapons programs or nuclear capabilities. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;Every single satellite payload must be permitted under this law by the New Zealand Space Agency, associated agencies, and the responsible minister. It is not permissible to launch weapons, nuclear or conventional, under this legislation.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>She said the Government will not approve payloads that:</p>
			<p>    contribute to nuclear weapons programs or capabilities<br>
				    harm, interfere with, or destroy other spacecraft, or systems on Earth<br>
				    support or enable defense, security or intelligence operations that are contrary to Government policy<br>
				    Are likely to cause serious or irreversible harm to the environment</p>
			<p>Stuart Nash, the minister responsible, must be satisfied that the applicant meets the threshold tests in the law, the spokesperson said. Payloads must be consistent with New Zealand&rsquo;s obligations in relation to:</p>
			<p>Research, Science and Innovation Minister Megan Woods announced earlier this year New Zealand&rsquo;s first Government-funded space mission to measure methane emissions from space, with the help of Rocket Lab.  </p>
			<p>The New Zealand-U.S. company has won a contract that may send two of its  spacecraft on a mission to Mars in 2024.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/21/south-korea-to-launch-leo-system/<br>
			</p>
			<p>South Korea is to build and launch more than 100 low Earth orbiting satellites for a national security system and to test and help develop &lsquo;next-generation&rsquo; communications.</p>
			<p>The country&rsquo;s Ministry of Science and ICT (information &amp; Communication Technology) said it would pursue such satellite development to encourage the private sector&rsquo;s involvement in the space industry as the mini-satellites can be manufactured in a short amount of time at a relatively low cost.</p>
			<p>The Yonhap news agency reports that the intention is to see an initial 14 satellites launched over the next decade to help serve 6G technology but with an additional 22 craft focusing on radio wave technology in space and a further 13 satellites designed to acquire what it describes as &ldquo;future technologies&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>The nation&rsquo;s Samsung technology giant has looked in the past at launching a global fleet of 4600 low Earth orbiting communications satellites but the project seems not to have been pursued. However, the initial plan called for the constellation to be operational by 2028.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/18/uefa-welcomes-italy-anti-piracy-operation/<br>
			</p>
			<p>European football&rsquo;s governing body UEFA, organiser and owner of the UEFA Euro 2020 tournament, has welcomed the anti-piracy operation in Italy conducted by the Guardia di Finanza, and coordinated by the Naples Public Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office.</p>
			<p>The operation, which lasted over a week, has seen more than 600 illegal platforms blocked which were unlawfully making available UEFA Euro 2020 matches. The Guardia di Finanza is primarily responsible for dealing with financial crime and smuggling in Italy. Those running the pirate services now risk imprisonment from six months to three years and a fine of up to &euro;15,493; while end users will automatically receive a significant administrative fine for an amount of up to &euro;1,032.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;UEFA welcomes and supports the &lsquo;Euro Strike 2020&rsquo; anti-piracy operation which has been undertaken by the Guardia di Finanza and coordinated by the Naples Public Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office. We would like to thank everyone involved for their efforts in fighting audiovisual piracy,&rdquo; said a UEFA spokesperson.</p>
			<p>Financial revenue generated from media rights sales is vital for the wellbeing of football, both professional and amateur, and in particular football development and grassroots investment throughout Europe. Therefore, it is important to protect our broadcasters for the good of the game including by bringing actions such as this against pirates.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Since the UEFA Euro tournament staged in 2004, UEFA has made &euro;2.6 billion available to its member associations through its HatTrick programme, with the vast majority of funding coming from the sale of media rights.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is an interesting development in disrupting illegal activity and one that has our full support,&rdquo; commented Kieron Sharp, CEO of UK pro-copyright body FACT. &ldquo;With such great demand for Euro 2020, blocking access to illegal streams sends a really clear message to fans that this is not a grey area. This is taken very seriously by law enforcement and the fines issued will be a direct and alarming wake up call for people using illegitimate content. Be in no doubt, this is serious crime which puts money into the pockets of criminals and harms the legitimate economy. FACT will continue to monitor channels used to advertise, market, sell and distribute apps, devices and streams, in order to take action against suppliers and operators.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Univision launches global streaming service <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/21/univision-launches-global-streaming-service/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Spanish-language media and content company Univision has unveiled its plans for a comprehensive global streaming service, which includes both free ad-supported and premium subscription-based options, to launch in the US and Latin America in 2022.</p>
			<p>The two-tier streaming service will offer a differentiated product proposition, vast content scope, expansive library and more Spanish-language originals than any other streaming service. The service will be fuelled by full access to Televisa&rsquo;s deep content library and IP as well as an ambitious slate of new originals produced by the leading creators in the Spanish-speaking world.</p>
			<p>The best of the existing PrendeTV, VIX and Univision NOW services will be transitioned and unified into one global service and brand. Brand, pricing and specific launch date for the service will be announced following the close of the Televisa-Univision merger later in 2021.</p>
			<p>The ad-supported tier (AVoD) will be anchored by Univision&rsquo;s current free Spanish-language streaming service, PrendeTV. This free tier will feature an upgraded, broadcast quality content proposition, including select originals, major studio films, premium Spanish-language titles, an expanded live sports offering and a unique 24/7 news service. In total, the free tier will have over 100 linear channels and over 40,000 hours of wholly-owned and acquired content that will also be offered in VoD form.</p>
			<p>The new premium subscription tier (SVoD) will feature more than 6,000 hours of Spanish-language content and more than 30 original productions exclusively on the service within its first year. The original productions for the service are being developed by some of the most notable established and up-and-coming creators in Spanish-language content today. The company&rsquo;s vision for the premium SVoD offering is to bring audiences more originally produced Spanish-language content than any other streaming service globally.</p>
			<p>To execute on this vision, Rodrigo Mazon has joined as EVP &amp; GM of SVOD, reporting directly to Pierluigi Gazzolo, President and Chief Transformation Officer at Univision. With more than 10 years&rsquo; experience in streaming, Mazon joins Univision from Netflix, where he most recently served as VP of Content. Mazon will be responsible for all elements of the SVoD service, including content and programming strategy, original content production, talent relations, content acquisitions from third-party producers and subscriber growth and retention.</p>
			<p>Mazon&rsquo;s appointment follows the recent addition of Michael Cerd&aacute; as Univision&rsquo;s new EVP, Product and Engineering, Streaming. Cerd&aacute; joined the company from Disney+, where he was global head of product, and oversees the product and engineering strategy for Univision&rsquo;s streaming portfolio. Rafael Urbina, Univision&rsquo;s EVP &amp; GM, AVOD Streaming, continues to lead PrendeTV, and will lead the future free ad-supported tier both in the U.S. and internationally.</p>
			<p>The service will be home to the most renowned and celebrated creators in Spanish-language media. As the first premium service specifically designed to serve the global Spanish-language audience, Univision will provide the resources and creative freedom to develop in-language, authentic, world class content that our community deserves. The SVoD tier will launch with more than 30 original productions throughout 2022, featuring globally-recognised and award-winning producers, creators and writers.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s announcement is a quantum leap in Univision&rsquo;s transformation as we aggressively scale and expand our streaming capabilities to bring thousands of hours of premium, original content to the nearly 600 million Spanish speakers around the world,&rdquo; said Pierluigi Gazzolo, President and Chief Transformation Officer at Univision. &ldquo;We are excited to announce our new SVOD service as a powerful cornerstone of this strategy, providing us the opportunity to reach global audiences with high-quality, original programming from distinguished producers and top talent not available anywhere else. With PrendeTV, and now with our SVoD offering, Univision is uniquely positioned to satisfy the global demand for premium Spanish-language content, the last truly meaningful open lane in global video streaming.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s announcement of our planned expansion is further bolstered by the impressive executive team leading our SVOD offering and PrendeTV. With this team we are bringing together some of the deepest and most relevant expertise in streaming across the media landscape. Rodrigo brings to Univision more than a decade of streaming experience from leading services such as Netflix and Hulu, where he established a proven track record of identifying programming trends that quickly engaged audiences as well as attracting notable creative talent across the entertainment industry,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Univision is an iconic brand and the leading Spanish-language media company in United States,&rdquo; commented Mazon. &ldquo;The previously-announced merger between Televisa and Univision will create a company of unprecedented creative resources in the Spanish-speaking world. I could not be more excited to join such a unique company and visionary team at a pivotal time in Univision&rsquo;s growth and transformation trajectory. I am eager to help drive Univision&rsquo;s global expansion through the launch of our SVoD service, which will enable us to engage global streaming audiences with compelling storytelling opportunities from our creative community.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Today we are only sharing a mere glimpse into the unrivaled Spanish-language originals&rsquo; slate that our SVoD service will feature. In addition to having direct access to the largest Spanish-language studio in the world, Televisa, Univision is also opening its doors to invite established and emerging Spanish-language creators to join us in developing what will undoubtedly be the most prolific Spanish-language streaming service.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;With today&rsquo;s announcement we are giving an early view into the scale and scope of our streaming ambitions,&rdquo; said Univision CEO Wade Davis. &ldquo;My partners and I closed on our acquisition of Univision less than six months ago, and I am incredibly proud of the progress we have made to date. With the acquisition and integration of VIX and the launch of the current, early version of PrendeTV, we now have an audience that is more than seven million users worldwide and growing rapidly. Pierlugi has brought together some of the best streaming executives in the industry. Michael has built, scaled and globalised one of the most successful streaming products in the world. Rafael has extensive experience scaling large, ad-supported video audiences, and Rodrigo is a pioneer in premium Spanish-language streaming and content. With this team and the resources we are allocating, we will launch a service that is differentiated, high quality and best in class.&rdquo;<br>

			<p><b><i>Sky News to launch dedicated regional Australia channel<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jun/16/sky-news-to-launch-dedicated-regional-australia-channel<br>
			</p>
			<p>The channel says it will reach up to 7 million regional viewers after striking free-to-air deals with Win and Southern Cross Austereo.</p>
			<p>Sky News Australia will launch a new free-to-air channel, Sky News Regional, in August after securing deals with two regional broadcasters which can potentially reach more than 7 million viewers.</p>
			<p>The channel&rsquo;s news and evening programs fronted by Andrew Bolt, Peta Credlin and other presenters will be aired to regional audiences on the dedicated 24-hour feed after Sky struck multi-year agreements with networks Win and Southern Cross Austereo (SCA).</p>
			<p>It comes as the federal government refuses to say whether Win will be penalised for shedding up to 20 staff and axing local TV news bulletins months after receiving $4.5m in journalism grants.</p>
			<p>The government handed out $50m in public interest news gathering grants (Ping) to more than 100 regional newspapers and broadcasters last June to help deal with severe declines in advertising revenue because of Covid-19.</p>
			<p>Those grants were given on the condition that applicants maintain &ldquo;existing levels of journalism production and distribution during the grant period&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>But last month Win announced it was cutting regional journalism jobs in Queensland, Victoria and parts of southern New South Wales, and moving to state-wide bulletins.</p>
			<p>The federal communications minister, Paul Fletcher, has declined to reveal what penalties, if any, will be imposed on Win, except to say thathis department had met with management after the job losses were announced.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The [communications] department receives periodic reports from all Ping grantees and can assess whether any of the terms of the grant have been breached,&rdquo; a spokesperson said. &ldquo;In that case there are provisions for part or all of a grant to be returned.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The department told Senate estimates that it spoke with Win after the announcement and &ldquo;early discussions indicate that they will continue to meet the requirements&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>A spokesperson for Win told Guardian Australia it was too early to say how many job losses were coming but the conditions of the grant would be met.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The Ping funding agreement is due for completion on 14 August 2021,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;The Win Network has no intention of breaking any conditions under that agreement.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Sky News Regional will be broadcast on channel 56 in 17 of SCA&rsquo;s regional markets across Victoria, southern NSW and Queensland, including Cairns, Townsville, Sunshine Coast, Canberra, Wollongong, Wagga Wagga, Orange, Bendigo and Ballarat.</p>
			<p>It will also be available on Win&rsquo;s channel 53 in northern NSW and on channel 83 in Griffith, NSW and South Australia.</p>
			<p>The former prime minister, Kevin Rudd, told the media diversity inquiry in February that Sky News would radicalise politics in Australia within a decade just as Fox News had undermined democracy in the US.</p>
			<p>The new deal, which includes a live breakfast show on weekdays, replaces Sky&rsquo;s first arrangement with Win, which is coming to an end next month after three years.</p>
			<p>Sky News broadcast in 30 regional markets under that historic first deal with Win but the channel would not be drawn on whether its new deal with SCA and Win would have a smaller footprint.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Sky News Regional will offer our award-winning news and opinion programming to a potential viewing audience of +7 million across select WIN and SCA markets,&rdquo; Sky News told Guardian Australia. &ldquo;And of course Sky News channels are available nationally on Foxtel.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Sky News Australia says its first foray into free-to-air television has reached 5.5 million unique viewers since 2018.</p>
			<p>The Sky News Australia chief executive, Paul Whittaker, who is celebrating 25 years of Sky News in Australia, said the new channel would introduce new audiences to Sky&rsquo;s &ldquo;unrivalled news coverage, together with informed analysis and context from our leading journalists and commentators&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We have established a strong and dedicated free-to-air audience in regional Australia and we are pleased that, through this new multi-year agreement with Southern Cross Austereo, we can now provide viewers on the SCA network with the opportunity to discover Sky News content through a new dedicated channel, Sky News Regional.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The SCA chief executive, Grant Blackley, said the contract meant regional Australians will soon have access to the &ldquo;high calibre and diverse programming&rdquo; of Sky News.</p>
			<p>Like all free-to-air channels, Sky News Regional will be subject to the provisions of the Commercial Television Industry Code, which recently forced Alan Jones to publish a correction after he &ldquo;misrepresented the research&rdquo; on the effectiveness of masks and lockdowns.<br>

			<p><b><i>Starlink dishes go into &ldquo;thermal shutdown&rdquo; once they hit 122&deg; Fahrenheit<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/06/starlink-dish-overheats-in-arizona-sun-knocking-user-offline-for-7-hours/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Man watered dish to cool it down but overheating knocked it offline for 7 hours.</p>
			<p>A Starlink beta user in Arizona said he lost Internet service for over seven hours yesterday when the satellite dish overheated, demonstrating one of the drawbacks of SpaceX's broadband service. When the user's Internet service was disrupted, the Starlink app provided an error message saying, &quot;Offline: Thermal shutdown.&quot; The dish &quot;overheated&quot; and &quot;Starlink will reconnect after cooling down,&quot; the error message said.</p>
			<p>The user, named Martin, posted a screenshot of the error message on Reddit. He contacted Starlink support, which told him, &quot;Dishy will go into thermal shutdown at 122F and will restart when it reaches 104F.&quot; Martin decided to give the dish a little water so it could cool down. He pointed a sprinkler at Dishy, and once it cooled enough to turn back on, &quot;I immediately heard YouTube resume playback,&quot; he wrote yesterday.</p>
			<p>But the Internet restoration was short-lived, Martin told Ars in a chat today.</p>
			<p>&quot;The fix was temporary,&quot; he told us. &quot;When I stopped the sprinkler, [the dish] heated back up and would cycle back on for a few minutes and go back down for thermal shutdown. The overheating started that day about 11:30 am and came back for good about 7 pm... I'm currently headed to a hardware store to get materials to build a solar shade/sail around the dish to see if it doesn't impact connection and speed.&quot;</p>
			<p>Martin uses the ground behind his house to set up his dish because it is the only spot with no obstructions. But there's &quot;no shade to speak of,&quot; he wrote in the Reddit comment thread.</p>
			<p>Thermal shutdowns affect other users</p>
			<p>Officially, SpaceX has said that &quot;Dishy McFlatface&quot; is certified to operate from 22&deg; below zero up to 104&deg; Fahrenheit. Temperatures reached about 120&deg; yesterday in Martin's town of Topock, near Arizona's border with California, he said. Though Dishy doesn't go into thermal shutdown until it hits 122&deg;, the dish can obviously get hotter than the air temperature.</p>
			<p>&quot;I'm thinking the radiating heat from the ground is effectively cooking the bottom of the dish, [while] the top of the dish is cooked by the sun,&quot; Martin told Ars. In addition to the shade he's building, Martin said he is &quot;waiting for permitting for a HAM radio tower&quot; that would lift the dish off the ground to help keep it cool enough to operate.</p>
			<p>Martin said he also had very short outages on several days since last week, but service came back before he had time to confirm whether they were caused by heat. SpaceX told users to expect periodic outages during beta, so Martin's previous outages could have been due either to heat or satellite availability.</p>
			<p>Another user in Virginia experienced a half-hour outage due to overheating on a day with temperatures in the low 80s, according to a Reddit post two months ago.</p>
			<p>Martin's post spurred a response from a beta user who also reported thermal shutdowns. &quot;You're not the only one. My Starlink is located 50 miles south of Grand Canyon in remote area,&quot; one person wrote yesterday. &quot;It's been off and on also. It stopped today one hour after cool down period but quit again as [of] ~12:30. Last reported temp at my weather station was 103 degrees.&quot;</p>
			<p>The 122&deg; F shutdown temperature was mentioned three weeks ago in a Reddit post by a user who had also been given the figure by Starlink support. &quot;'That's it??' was my thought. On a 90 degree day, the rooftop of my house can be around 125 degrees,&quot; that user wrote.</p>
			<p>&quot;Are you sure that wasn&rsquo;t Celsius?&quot; another asked. (122&deg; C converts to 251.6&deg; F.)</p>
			<p>Like Martin, other Starlink users may have to find creative ways to keep their dishes cool as the summer months arrive.</p>
			<p>Dishy&rsquo;s heat management</p>
			<p>As we wrote in December, a teardown of Dishy McFlatface showed some of its heat-management components, including a metal shield that's peppered with blue dots made of thermally conductive material that conducts heat away from the PCB and into the shield.</p>
			<p>Ken Keiter, the engineer who performed the teardown, was interviewed by Vice's Motherboard section for a story about the Arizona resident today:</p>
			<p>Keiter told Motherboard that while reasonable consideration was given to heat dissipation in Dishy's design, he could see the potential for problems.</p>
			<p>&quot;The phased array assembly comprises a PCBA (printed circuit board assembly) adhered to an aluminum backplate which serves several purposes&#151;acting as RF shielding, providing structural rigidity and, most relevantly, acting as a radiative thermal mass (heat sink) for the components on the PCBA,&quot; Keiter said.</p>
			<p>Heat is funneled from the circuit board to the aluminum backplate using a foam-like thermal interface material (TIM). The backplate itself resides in a weather-sealed cavity containing a small amount of air. As this backplate heats up, the air surrounding it also heats, transferring thermal energy via the plastic enclosure to the outside environment, Keiter said.</p>
			<p>&quot;Here's the problem: at some point, the combined thermal energy being absorbed by Dishy's face and being dumped by the components into the backplate, the air surrounding it, and the enclosure exceeds the amount that is being dissipated to the outside environment,&quot; he noted.</p>
			<p>Keiter said that software changes could &quot;make the system more thermally efficient&quot; but that it's possible SpaceX will need to make &quot;a significant hardware revision for the commercial launch.&quot; He called it &quot;a really tricky engineering problem with some insanely tight constraints.&quot;</p>
			<p>We contacted SpaceX today and will update this article if we get a response. </p>
			<p>SpaceX seeks stability before exiting beta</p>
			<p>The Starlink public beta began in October 2020, and there's still no word on when exactly it will hit commercial availability. But the service could happen within months, as SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said that Starlink will be available to &quot;most of Earth&quot; by the end of 2021 and the whole planet by next year. Still, SpaceX expects to have a limited number of slots in each geographic region because of capacity constraints.</p>
			<p>SpaceX is seeking Federal Communications Commission permission to deploy up to 5 million user terminals in the US. Over 500,000 people have ordered Starlink, and Musk has said he expects all of those users to get service. But he also said that SpaceX will face &quot;more of a challenge when we get into the several million user range.&quot; The biggest limitation would be in densely populated urban areas; rural users would have better odds of getting service.</p>
			<p>As noted earlier, Starlink warns beta users to expect &quot;brief periods of no connectivity at all&quot;&#151;even if they don't run into thermal shutdowns. &quot;We still have a lot of work to do to make the network reliable,&quot; SpaceX president and COO Gwynne Shotwell said in April. &quot;We still have drops, not necessarily just because of where the satellites are in the sky.&quot; SpaceX will keep the service in beta &quot;until the network is reliable and great and something we'd be proud of,&quot; Shotwell said.</p>
			<p>The Verge reviewed Starlink last month and found frustrating reliability problems. &quot;Like the similarly over-hyped mmWave 5G, Starlink is remarkably delicate. Even a single tree blocking the dish's line of sight to the horizon will degrade and interrupt your Starlink signal,&quot; The Verge wrote.</p>
			<p>Starlink is only part of the solution</p>
			<p>The service will surely become more stable by the time SpaceX moves it from beta to general availability, as Shotwell promised. Even in beta, Starlink is providing much-needed connectivity to people with no other options. If SpaceX brings reliable broadband to a few million users, that would be a success, but there may be tens of millions of Americans without access to high-speed broadband. Tens of millions of others have to pay whatever the cable company demands because there's no competition where they live.</p>
			<p>Widespread fiber-to-the-home deployment would make a bigger difference for more Internet users than Starlink. President Joe Biden pledged to lower prices and deploy &quot;future-proof&quot; broadband to all Americans, but he's already scaled back his plan in the face of opposition from Republicans and incumbent ISPs. AT&amp;T has been lobbying against nationwide fiber and funding for municipal networks, and AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey expressed confidence last week that Congress will steer legislation in the direction that AT&amp;T favors.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Indonesian entertainment network Mola has deployed Broadpeak&rsquo;s content delivery network and video streaming tech on its OTT platform.</p>
			<p>The company has deployed a comprehensive CDN solution from Broadpeak to optimise the delivery of ABR live sports streaming content, including English Premier League matches. The solution uses Broadpeak&rsquo;s advanced CDN, BkM100 video delivery manager, and BkS400 HTTP video cache servers in order to deliver a high quality of experience while reducing video streaming costs.</p>
			<p>Mola said that the Broadpeak tech substantially improves the QoE for viewers of Mola&rsquo;s ABR streaming service, and that the BkM100 video delivery mediator allows it to choose the most appropriate BkS400 HTTP video cache servers for streaming live content.</p>
			<p>Ching Ping Lee, chief technology officer at Mola, said: &ldquo;Mola has become a hub for EPL matches and other live sports streaming content, and as our video streaming service grows, we need a scalable video delivery network solution for all screens. Broadpeak provides us with a scalable, flexible CDN solution that sets a path for seamless OTT growth in the future. With Broadpeak&rsquo;s CDN, we can deliver a high QoE with low latency and reduced buffering, which is critical for live sports.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Jacques Le Mancq, CEO at Broadpeak, said: &ldquo;We are excited to partner with Mola, a premium content provider and aggregator in Indonesia. Live sports streaming is a huge revenue opportunity for content providers, but the environment can be complex. As a leader in the CDN market, we understand the unique challenges and opportunities of OTT and will bring increased efficiency, scalability, and exceptional quality to Mola&rsquo;s streaming service so that they can keep fans engaged and satisfied.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/06/17/globecast-viaccess-orca-and-mainstreaming-partner-for-end-to-end-ott-platform/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Media solutions provider Globecast has announced a partnership with Viaccess-Orca and MainStreaming.</p>
			<p>The new coalition of vendors will see the creation of a new end-to-end OTT platform, app and associated backend infrastructure.</p>
			<p>The companies have created an initial demonstration version of the app for live content. Globecast handles encoding of feeds, which are then delivered to the MainStreaming backend via an RTMP or MPEG-DASH stream. From there, the feeds are fully managed by  Viaccess-Orca&rsquo;s TV Platform as a Service (TVaaS) which includes on top of the app the content protection with its multi-DRM solution and the secure player.</p>
			<p>VOD content operates in a similar workflow.</p>
			<p>The companies said that the app is fully customisable and is pre-integrated into the Viaccess-Orca TV platform. It is optimised for iOS, Android, tablets and PC. </p>
			<p>Alessandro Alquati, MD of Globecast Italy, said: &ldquo;Globecast is dedicated to continuing to enhance its OTT solutions portfolio to satisfy demand coming from the OTT market for both live and VOD services as complementary to traditional distribution. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s imperative that when working with our customers we can show the most complete, latest working solutions to them. To do so we have partnered with MainStreaming and Viaccess-Orca who are already experts in providing solutions built specifically for live and VOD streaming.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Antonio Corrado, Founder and CEO at MainStreaming, said: &ldquo;I believe this app allows media companies to accelerate their streaming transformation. We are proud to facilitate this change with our iMDP Service, the first video delivery platform designed for video streaming with sustainability in mind. It strengthens the quality of their video content distribution, ensuring their audience a flawless experience&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Philippe Leonetti, CEO at Viaccess-Orca, said: &ldquo;We are excited to embark on this new partnership with Globecast and MainStreaming. Pairing our cloud-based TVaaS with next-gen technologies from Globecast and MainStreaming, we are simplifying the delivery of OTT services, ensuring a superior TV experience on connected devices and allowing operators to quickly monetise their offerings.&rdquo;<br>

			</p>
			<p>Telstra Broadcast Services (TBS) has acquired the business and assets of MediaCloud Pty Ltd. (MediaCloud).</p>

				Rocket Lab to design two satellites for a mission to Mars<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/rocket-lab-design-two-satellites-mission-mars<br>
			</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab will be designing two satellites for a mission to Mars to study the planet&rsquo;s solar winds, the company announced tonight. </p>
			<p>The mission, part of a multi-million dollar NASA science programme, aims to study solar winds to better understand how the climate of the red planet has changed. </p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s the furthest Rocket Lab has ever sent satellites to. If all goes to plan, a launch will take place in 2024 aboard another NASA-provided commercial space launch. <br>
				Rocket Lab awarded NASA contract to design two separate spacecraft for a mission to Mars</p>
			<p>Kiwi founder and CEO Peter Beck said the mission was &ldquo;hugely promising&rdquo;. </p>
			<p>He said sending two satellites to the red planet would give scientists a unique viewpoint because it would show how solar winds strip the atmosphere away from Mars. This will help scientists understand how its climate has changed over time. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;Planetary science missions have traditionally cost hundreds of millions of dollars and taken up to a decade to come to fruition.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Beck said Rocket Lab aimed to &ldquo;demonstrate a more cost-effective approach to planetary exploration&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Rocket Lab's satellite designs will undergo a NASA preliminary review this month. A confirmation review in July will decide whether the mission actually goes ahead. <br>

				World's first wooden satellite to be launched from New Zealand<br>

				The satellite, designed and built in Finland will orbit at around 500-600 km altitude in a roughly polar Sun-synchronous orbit.</p>
			<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has planned to put the world&rsquo;s first wooden satellite, WISA Woodsat, on Earth&rsquo;s orbit by the end of this year. The mission of the satellite is to test the applicability of wooden materials like plywood in spacecraft structures and expose it to extreme space conditions, such as heat, cold, vacuum and radiation, for an extended period of time.</p>
			<p>It will be launched to space by the end of 2021 with a Rocket Lab Electron rocket from the Mahia Peninsula launch complex in New Zealand.</p>
			<p>The satellite, designed and built in Finland will orbit at around 500-600 km altitude in a roughly polar Sun-synchronous orbit. WISA Woodsat is a 10x10x10 cm nano satellite built up from standardised boxes and surface panels made from plywood, the same material that is found in a hardware store or to make furniture.</p>
			<p>Designers have placed the wood in a thermal vacuum chamber to keep dry when its in space. They have also added a very thin aluminium oxide layer to minimise vapour coming from the wood and to protect it from erosive effects of atomic oxygen.</p>
			<p>Woodsat&rsquo;s only non-wooden external parts are corner aluminium rails used for its deployment into space and a metal selfie stick. The selfie stick with its camera can take pictures of the satellite and look how the plywood is behaving.</p>
			<p>It can show if there is any cracking on the plywood or any colour changing as the wood is expected to be darkened by the ultraviolet radiation of unfiltered sunlight, said Jari Makinen, a Finnish writer and broadcaster who initiated the mission.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The good thing here is we have ended up devising a low-cost device that could find all kinds of further uses, both in orbit and down on the ground in test environments,&quot; said Bruno Bras, materials engineer at ESA.<br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/15/warnermedia-to-introduce-cnn-pay-wall/<br>
			</p>
			<p>News broadcaster CNN is preparing to launch a CNN+ service, and will charge viewers to access the transmission.</p>
			<p>AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey, speaking at an event in Washington DC, confirmed the service, telling delegates that CNN+ &ldquo;will occur&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Some two weeks ago the WSJ reported that CNN was firing &ldquo;hundreds&rdquo; of extra staff to help create new shows hosted by the network&rsquo;s star talent. But many questions remain, and Stankey sidestepped most of them. However, the consensus questions concern the subscription rate for CNN+, what will be available, how different will it be to the regular broadcast channel, will there be ads, etc., etc?</p>
			<p>One fact has emerged and it concerns the employment contracts for those CNN evening hosts such as Anderson Cooper. Reportedly, he and some of his colleagues, have seen restructured employment contracts which cover additional workloads and for output that would not screen on CNN itself.</p>
			<p>The best guess, and hinted at by CNN president Jeff Zucker, is that CNN+ would launch within the next 12 months.<br>

				Comcast switches from SES-11 to AMC-11 <br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/15/comcast-switches-from-ses-11-to-amc-11/<br>
			</p>
			<p>SES has announced it will continue delivering Comcast Technology Solutions&rsquo; Managed Satellite Distribution service, formerly known as Headend in the Sky (HITS), that reaches hundreds of multichannel video programming distributor systems across the US. SES recently renewed its long-term relationship with Comcast Technology Solutions (CTS), a division of Comcast Cable that provides media and entertainment technology to advertisers, agencies and content providers.</p>
			<p>As part of a new, multi-year extension agreement, SES will be transitioning CTS&rsquo;s Managed Satellite Distribution service from SES-11 at 105 degrees West to AMC-11 at 131 degrees West. This is part of SES&rsquo;s plan to clear the C-band spectrum in the US to accommodate the deployment of 5G services in the coming years.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;For more than two decades, CTS&rsquo;s Managed Satellite Distribution service has enabled multichannel video affiliates to transition to digital services, reduce costs and reclaim valuable bandwidth for new services. SES is using advanced compression as part of the transition to AMC-11 and is working with CTS to ensure its Managed Satellite Distribution affiliates have a seamless transition, deliver a high-quality experience to their subscribers and ensure no interference from 5G transmissions on the cleared spectrum,&rdquo; says SES.</p>
			<p>As part of its C-band clearing plan, SES will also be launching new C-band satellites to provide continuity of service well into the future for CTS and its Managed Satellite Distribution affiliates.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;SES has been integral in providing continuity of service to our Managed Satellite Distribution customers in the midst of great change. The current transition of satellite services in order to free up C-band spectrum represents a huge change for us and our partners. SES has been collaborative and hands-on, participating in webinars and outreach efforts to maximise response time for businesses, solve for problems before they occur, and provide clear transition paths for every impacted operation,&rdquo; said Allison Olien, VP/GM Communications and Technology Provider Suite for Comcast Technology Solutions.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Comcast Technology Solutions has been a critical customer and partner for SES for decades, and our relationship has strengthened further as we jointly re-engineer the Managed Satellite Distribution service to ensure that millions continue to receive radio and TV programming across the US. Our focus throughout the C-band clearing process has been to support our customers in delivering state-of-the-art services while freeing up spectrum for the US market. We are using the best technologies, processes and people to do this, and our partnership with CTS is a great testament to that,&rdquo; said Steve Collar, CEO of SES.<br>

				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/15/ses-decommissions-astra-2b/</p>
			<p>SES has moved Astra 2B to a graveyard orbit and well above the standard geo-stationary orbits used by the satellite industry.</p>
			<p>Launched in September 2000 and was co-located with Astra 2A at 28.2 degrees East, the craft has also served at the core SES hotspot at 19.2 degrees East and 31.5 degrees East over the past few years.</p>
			<p>While at 28.2&deg; East, television signals could be received with a 43 cm dish across the majority of the British Isles with a 60 cm dish required in the extreme north and west, although the official footprint maps now show a 60 cm dish as required across all of Western Europe. At 28.2&deg; East, 17 transponders on Astra 2B were used by BSkyB to provide the Sky Digital television services of standard and HD television and digital radio.</p>
			<p>Astra 2A was moved to 19.2 degrees East in February 2013. Later it was moved to 31.5 degrees East in January 2014.</p>
			<p>In total the craft was well utilised and served SES for some 20 years 8 months, despit having a design life of an expected 15 years. Astra 2A was built by Airbus (as Astrium).<br>

			<p><b><i>Starlink will be a lifeline for left-behind rural broadband<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL2106/S00045/starlink-will-be-a-lifeline-for-left-behind-rural-broadband.htm<br>
			</p>
			<p>If you are stuck with a slow, unreliable rural fixed wireless connection, Starlink will change your life.</p>
			<p>It will make an even bigger difference if you are off the broadband map.</p>
			<p>Starlink has great potential as a fail-over service. Companies that can&rsquo;t afford to be offline even for a few minutes can use it as a backstop.</p>
			<p>For everyone else, Starlink&rsquo;s main impact will be competitive pressure on your monthly internet bill.<br>
				Filling the gaps</p>
			<p>By the end of 2022 New Zealand&rsquo;s ultrafast broadband network will reach 87 percent of homes and businesses.</p>
			<p>Rural Broadband Initiative services should reach another 10 percent. There are national fixed wireless options from the big mobile carriers. Not all are good.</p>
			<p>Wisps offer localised alternatives. They can be brilliant. You can expect a more personal service to go with it.<br>
				The last two percent</p>
			<p>That leaves about two percent of the population without any locally-supplied, government supported broadband.</p>
			<p>If that&rsquo;s you, Starlink is the most practical option.</p>
			<p>A couple of alternative satellite services are due to join Starlink over the next two years.</p>
			<p>You won&rsquo;t be spoiled for choice. But after years of zero choice, you&rsquo;ll have options.<br>
				Fibre is better</p>
			<p>As things stand today, Starlink is not the best service for the 87 percent who can get fibre. Fibre is cheaper, faster and more reliable.</p>
			<p>On paper it looks like Starlink won&rsquo;t be the best option for people who can get fixed wireless broadband on urban frequencies. These are people who live close to a cellular tower. If you can see it from your property, you should be good.</p>
			<p>Today&rsquo;s Starlink service may offer similar speeds, but it is more expensive, needs an upfront hardware investment and coverage can be sporadic.<br>
				Beta service</p>
			<p>At the moment Starlink offers a beta service. When more satellites are launched its performance should improve. There are suggestions it will come down in price.</p>
			<p>If that happens you might need to think again. For now, stick with the devil you know.</p>
			<p>Those people with poor fixed wireless broadband connections now have an option.</p>
			<p>If that&rsquo;s you, and you need a better connection and can afford the higher asking price, then $160 a month and almost a grand upfront for the receiver, looks like a good deal.<br>
				Performance</p>
			<p>You may have seen gushing posts about Starlink performance on places like Geekzone. It can be good.</p>
			<p>But that&rsquo;s not always the case.</p>
			<p>Remember, like any broadband delivered by radio waves, you share the spectrum with other users. If a lot of people in your neighbourhood are on Starlink at the same time, you can expect performance to drop.</p>
			<p>Likewise, Starlink is a line of sight service, if there are hills, buildings or trees between you and the satellite, you&rsquo;ll run into problems.<br>
				Low earth orbit</p>
			<p>Keep in mind that Starlink is a low-earth orbit satellite. That means the nearest satellite will often be low in the sky.</p>
			<p>None of this is secret. Starlink is refreshingly open about the restrictions on its service. That hasn&rsquo;t always been the case with over enthusiastic fixed wireless salespeople.</p>
			<p>There&rsquo;s an app which will tell you what to expect in terms of coverage.</p>
			<p>There&rsquo;s another problem that will be a major worry in parts of rural New Zealand. Starlink&rsquo;s receiver doesn&rsquo;t like high wind conditions.<br>
				Fixed wireless</p>
			<p>When 4G fixed wireless broadband started, I spoke to an excited farmer who was getting 85mbps from his local tower.</p>
			<p>It was 300m from his house and he was the only user at the time. He may see similar speeds at times now the tower has filled, but it won&rsquo;t be consistent.</p>
			<p>You can expect to have more than enough broadband to watch streaming video services like Netflix. Buffering papers over the cracks in these services. Services like Spark Sport and Sky Go may see more dropouts if you watch live games.<br>
				Latency</p>
			<p>The biggest drawback is latency. Reports from overseas say it swings from being fibre-like to dropping out. You&rsquo;ll be able to do Zoom calls, but you may want to warn the people you talk to that your connection can drop at any moment.</p>
			<p>Gamers might not like the variable latency. If split-second pixel shooting is that important to you, it&rsquo;s time to consider moving to the big smoke.</p>
			<p>Reading between the lines of overseas coverage, Starlink&rsquo;s main reason for being is compensates for poor network coverage in countries and parts of countries without competitive broadband. That and more remote rural users who are off the normal networks.<br>
				Competition</p>
			<p>For New Zealand it will fill the gaps. Competition could give Vodafone and Spark a kick forcing them to improve poor performing RBI services. Or they may pass. If enough people on a poor rural tower defect to Starlink, performance may improve for those who stay.</p>
			<p>Let&rsquo;s repeat. Today Starlink is a beta service. More satellites are coming. That could change everything.</p>
			<p>There&rsquo;s talk that the price may drop as more people get on board. This is a two edged sword. More people can mean more congestion. Either way, it&rsquo;s going to be worth watching Starlink.</p>

					</i></b><br>
				
				From https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/06/14/21/philippines-to-launch-biggest-satellite-mula-in-2023</p>
			<p>MANILA - The Philippines' largest satellite will be launched into space in 2023, its space agency said Monday.</p>
			<p>The satellite MULA can capture images within a coverage of 100,000 square meters, said Gay Jane Perez, deputy director of the Philippine Space Agency.</p>
			<p>&quot;Ang makukuha ng satellite ay makakatulong sa agrikultura sa pamamagitan ng pagmomonitor ng ating pananim, pamamahala ng kagubatan, pagtukoy sa pagbabago ng land use. At higit sa lahat pagtugon sa sakuna,&quot; she told ABS-CBN's Teleradyo.</p>
			<p>(The satellite images will help the agricultural sector by monitoring our crops, our forest, and identifying change in land use. It will also help in disaster response.)</p>
			<p>Sixteen Filipino engineers are working on the satellite, including 9 who are in the United Kingdom for their training, Perez said.</p>
			<p>The country's biggest satellite will be its 7th in space, she added.</p>
			<p>Government will launch this year satellites Maya-3 and Maya-4. It had previously launched Diwata-1, Diwata-2, and Maya 1 and Maya-2, according to Perez.<br>

				Intelsat accuses SES of misnaming it in FCC filings <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/14/intelsat-accuses-ses-of-misnaming-it-in-fcc-filings/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The legal dispute between SES and Intelsat has now extended itself to the FCC, and the FCC&rsquo;s official licensing of C-band frequencies.</p>
			<p>Intelsat, on June 11th, filed a formal submission to the FCC and clarified which of the many Intelsat businesses actually held the C-band licences over the US.</p>
			<p>On June 10th, SES Americom filed a statement to the FCC saying that it &ldquo;reserved its rights&rdquo; in the dispute between SES and Intelsat in the claim by SES for some $420 million of extra cash &#150; and potentially an overall $1.8 billion if punitive damages are awarded &#150; in the division of the FCC&rsquo;s assorted incentive payments for C-band restructuring over the US.</p>
			<p>The SES letter to the FCC said the licensed satellite operator was Intelsat US LLC. The letter stated that SES reserves &ldquo;its rights with respect to any and all claims that it may have against Intelsat or any of its affiliates, irrespective of which Intelsat entity may sign a particular contract, plan, or any other document or agreement arising from or related to the C-band proceeding and transition.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&lsquo;Not quite&rsquo; implies Intelsat. Its June 11th letter to the FCC said that actual licence holder is Intelsat License LLC. The letter adds: &ldquo;Intelsat License LLC has also always been the filer entity of all filings in this and other C-band related dockets. In order to avoid any potential for confusion, we again state for the record that Intelsat License LLC is the &ldquo;electing satellite operator&rdquo; as that term is defined in the Report and Order and FCC rules, and (as SES well knows) Intelsat License LLC will be the entity receiving the accelerated relocation payments that are earned. Moreover, to the extent that it matters, SES&rsquo;s own past filings identified and acknowledged that Intelsat License LLC was and is the entity electing to undertake clearing responsibilities in the C-band.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Intelsat also argues that SES&rsquo;s &ldquo;statement reserving its rights with respect to any and all claims that it may have against Intelsat or any of its affiliates&rdquo; is legally meaningless.</p>
			<p>Intelsat goes on to say that the FCC is not the forum where SES should further attempt to buttress its weak arguments in litigation which does not involve the FCC.</p>
			<p>At the heart of the SES letter, and core to its argument in front of Intelsat&rsquo;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy court, are worries that Intelsat could be involved in a deliberate &ldquo;shell game&rdquo; as regards Intelsat&rsquo;s current and expected assets, and in particular the $5 billion which would flow from the FCC in respect to the C-band auction of spectrum.</p>
			<p>A co-counsel lawyer for SES, Orin Snyder (of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP), recently told the bankruptcy court that the SES claim for $420 million was the largest against Intelsat. &ldquo;However, when we win this claim it would be a pyrrhic victory if Intelsat had simply protected and moved its assets to other Intelsat entities.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Snyder wanted the court to be very aware that the SES claim was against all the Intelsat entities involved in the Chapter 11 reconstruction.<br>

				MultiChoice adds 1.4m subs <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/14/multichoice-adds-1-4m-subs/<br>
			</p>
			<p>South Africa&rsquo;s MultiChoice has prospered in the last 12 months. Including its DStv and SuperSport broadcasting brands, the pay-TV operator grew its subscriber base by 1.4 million over the past year. Subscriber numbers now total 20.9 million when its overall Africa viewers are added in.</p>
			<p>South Africa itself has 8.9 million subs, with 11.9 million elsewhere in Africa as at March 31st.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This represents an accelerated 7 per cent growth year on year, driven by heightened consumer demand for video entertainment products, continued penetration of the mass market and an easing of electricity shortages in southern Africa,&rdquo; the company said.</p>
			<p>The strength of its subscriber base drove group revenue 4 per cent higher at R53.4 billion. The broadcaster&rsquo;s cost-containment programme had saved R1.5 billion during the year. The end result was a trading profit of R10.3 billion.</p>
			<p>The results are all the more impressive considering that ad-revenues have been badly hit, and advertising revenues fell 11 per cent during the year.</p>
			<p>On its South Africa trading, MultiChoice said the business &ldquo;held up well&rdquo; despite the tough economic environment, delivering year-on-year subscriber growth of 6 per cent &#151; or about half a million linear pay-TV subscribers on a 90-day active basis.</p>
			<p>However, the broadcaster&rsquo;s monthly ARPU was under pressure, falling from R290 to R277.<br>

			<p>OneWeb&rsquo;s next batch of low Earth orbiting satellites have arrived at the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia&rsquo;s Far East. They will now be prepared for launch by Arianespace&rsquo;s team on site who work with Starsem for integration onto a Soyuz 2.1b rocket.</p>
			<p>The likely date for launch, subject to the usual weather and technical checks, is July 1st.</p>
			<p>There are already 218 OneWeb satellites in orbit and this next group of 36 will be released from the Soyuz rocket in 4 separate batches which will then be raised to their correct orbital positions.</p>
			<p>There&rsquo;s another launch planned for around August 2nd and when that batch of 36 is orbited the fleet will total 290 craft.<br>

			<p>Nilesat has followed Arabsat in taking down broadcasts from the Lebanon-based Al-Manar TV news channel, which is funded by the controversial Hamas organisation.</p>
			<p>Transmissions of Al-Manar will cease on June 15th. Justifying the decision, Nilesat&rsquo;s board of directors claim that Al-Manar TV violated the agreement signed between both parties and broadcast programmes which provoke sectarian strife and sedition.</p>
			<p>Nilesat has informed Lebanon&rsquo;s Ministry of Communications of its decision.</p>
			<p>Al-Manar sources suggest that the move is in line with recent Gulf (and Saudi) measures to &ldquo;punish&rdquo; Lebanon and Al-Manar over policies that have angered Saudi Arabia.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://mumbrella.com.au/sports-flick-expands-football-stable-with-concacaf-gold-cup-687276<br>
			</p>
			<p>Football-focussed streaming service Sports Flick continues to expand its portfolio of leagues and competitions, landing the rights to North America&rsquo;s 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup.</p>
			<p>The competition will be played in the USA and broadcast live and exclusive to Aussies via the Sports Flick platform, and takes place from 10 July to 1 August.</p>
			<p>The CONCACAF Gold Cup joins Sports Flick&rsquo;s growing stable of football competitions, which includes the K-League, Austrian Bundesliga, Chinese Super League, Liga Primera and UAE Arabian Gulf League.</p>
			<p>The platform also streams an eclectic range of other sports including European handball, Indian and Panama baseball, Ju-Jitsu, Serbian rugby league.</p>
			<p>The 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup will feature Host Nation the United States, as well as Canada, and Confederation heavyweights Mexico, Costa Rica, and Honduras.</p>
			<p>Sports Flick CEO, Dylan Azzopardi, said: &ldquo;We are proud to announce another major football tournament to be broadcast on Sports Flick. We are committed in our endeavours to provide more football from around the world for Australians to watch.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>GM Michael Turner added: &ldquo;The CONCACAF Gold Cup is a fantastic opportunity for Australians to connect with football from another corner of the world.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Our latest acquisition supports our broadcast strategy, that Football is the world game, and we want to ensure Australians can enjoy as much football as possible from all corners of the world.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>CONCACAF is working with MEDIAPRO Group to promote the Gold Cup internationally, and managing director of Mediapro Asia, Lars Heidenreich, said: &ldquo;As part of our growing slate of properties, we are delighted to be able to bring the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup to Australia through Sports Flick.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We trust this event brings more diverse content to the Football fans in Australia and enhances our partnership with Sports Flick, diversifying their existing library of sports rights for their Australian audiences.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Sports Flick recently wrapped up its broadcast of the UEFA Women&rsquo;s Champions League.</p>
			<p>Reports emerged earlier in 2021 that the platform was in the running to snatch the UEFA Men&rsquo;s Champions League rights from under the nose of current holders Optus Sport (having done the same with the K-League), but Mumbrella understands that Sports Flick is no longer a front-runner for the competition.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Optus Sport continues to cement its own football offering, landing the rights to the 2023 Women&rsquo;s World Cup, to be played in Australia and New Zealand. It is also preparing to broadcast flagship international tournaments, the Euros and Copa America, over the next month or so.</p>
			<p>The latest deal continues the fragmentation of worldwide football competitions across streaming platforms in Australia, following Network Ten parent ViacomCBS securing the rights to the A-League, ending a 15-year affiliation with Foxtel.</p>
			<p>Foxtel still has broadcast deals for international competitions including the Spanish Liga and German Bundesliga on Fox Sports and its Kayo streaming service.<br>

			<p>THE Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA) announced on Thursday it would launch a bigger Earth observation satellite in 2023 that could be used for disaster management, land use and land cover change mapping, crop monitoring, and forestry management.</p>
			<p>The 130-kilogram multispectral unit for land assessment (MULA) commercial-grade satellite can capture operational-quality images of approximately 100,000 square kilometers of land area daily, using a true-color camera capable of capturing 5-meter resolution images with a wide swath width of 120 kilometers.</p>
			<p>PhilSA Deputy Director General Dr. Gay Jane Perez said MULA will be the first of the next-generation satellites aimed at strengthening the Philippines' space program.<br>
				poster<br>
				  <br>
				&quot;We are all very excited to start the development of MULA. Equipped with the acquired technical know-how and capabilities through our experiences in building Diwata and MAYA satellites, we are now moving forward with our first operational and industrial quality satellite aimed toward providing a wide range of socio-economic benefits for the country - to better monitor terrestrial ecosystems, as well as our land and marine resources - to ensure both agricultural productivity and environmental integrity,&quot; Perez said.</p>
			<p>Perez explained MULA could help the country to be more proactive in disaster management and mitigation through its capability to assess environmental conditions.</p>
			<p>MULA project manager Engineer John Leur Labrador said images taken by the new satellite can enhance the information gathered from the previous images.</p>
			<p>&quot;We can think of this spacecraft as a Filipino astronaut tasked to take images of our natural resources while monitoring aircraft and ship activity in our country at the same time,&quot; Labrador said.</p>
			<p>Tasked to run the project was the University of the Philippines Diliman and the Department of Science and Technology's Advanced Science and Technology Institute in coordination with PhilSA. British company Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL) will assist in the design and manufacturing aspects of the project.</p>
			<p>Since December 2020, over 30 Filipino engineers have attended a virtual small satellite system design course conducted by SSTL, while nine local engineers are currently undergoing full immersion in satellite design and manufacturing process in the United Kingdom.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/10/177857/<br>
			</p>
			<p>FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has announced the latest step in making mid-band spectrum available for next generation wireless services, including 5G. In a Public Notice, the FCC&rsquo;s Office of Economics and Analytics and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau established the application and bidding procedures for Auction 110, the auction of spectrum in the 3.45 GHz band. Bidding is scheduled to start on October 5th, 2021.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is a critical step toward delivering on the promise of 5G,&rdquo; said Rosenworcel. &ldquo;This auction will bring us closer to 5G service that is fast, secure, resilient, and most importantly, available across the country. I want to thank the great FCC staff for their work on this as well as our partners in the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Department of Defense.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Auction 110 will offer up to 4,060 new flexible-use licences in the 3.45 to 3.55 GHz band divided into ten 10-megahertz blocks licensed by geographic areas known as Partial Economic Areas (PEAs). In the first phase of the auction, the clock phase, bidders will bid on generic blocks in each geographic area. In the second phase, the assignment phase, they will bid on frequency-specific licence assignments.</p>
			<p>The notice announces upfront payment and minimum opening bid amounts as well as the availability of bidding credit discounts for eligible small businesses, rural service providers, and for the deployment of facilities and services to qualified federally recognised tribal lands. As required by law, auction proceeds must cover the expected sharing and relocation costs for federal users in the band. The Public Notice sets a reserve price of approximately $14.7 billion (&euro;12bn). By releasing the Public Notice and setting a bidding start date of October 5th, the FCC is fulfilling Congress&rsquo;s directive in the Consolidated Appropriations <br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/10/spacex-looks-to-in-flight-broadband-for-starlink/<br>
			</p>
			<p>SpaceX is reportedly in talks with several airlines about them utilising its Starlink broadband satellite system on their aircraft.</p>
			<p>Jonathan Hofeller, SpaceX&rsquo;s VP of Starlink and commercial sales, told a panel at the Connected Aviation Intelligence Summit on June 9th that Starlink was in talks with several airlines and had carried out &ldquo;some&rdquo; demonstrations.</p>
			<p>Starlink already has plans to see its equipment on private executive jets and has requested permission from the FCC to use Starlink equipment on &ldquo;Earth stations in motion&rdquo; which is the jargon used to cover vehicles on the move, trucks, maritime users and aircraft. However, Elon Musk at the time commented and said that Starlink wasn&rsquo;t intended for use in private cars as its equipment was too large.</p>
			<p>Hofeller said that SpaceX&rsquo;s airline antennas would employ enhanced technology for aircraft connectivity. He also told delegates that Starlink&rsquo;s next generation versions would have inter-satellite links for improved connectivity.</p>
			<p>But Starlink is coming late to the aircraft queue. Already busy supplying aircraft broadband are companies such as Viasat, Gilat, Intelsat, Hughes, SES, Eutelsat and others. Recent entrants also include OneWeb and there are other would-be suppliers of airline connectivity.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/New_spacecraft_will_use_lasers_to_transmit_video_data_in_seconds_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>New space missions being launched this summer will attempt to revolutionize space communications by using laser beams to quickly transmit large amounts of data, including high-definition video from the moon.</p>
			<p>Two missions by the U.S. government will test such lasers, which use invisible, infrared light beams.</p>
			<p>NASA's Laser Communications Relay Demonstration will explore the best ways to beam information to the Earth from orbit using lasers. And a separate demonstration for the Department of Defense, known as LINCS, will focus on beaming laser communications between two small satellites.</p>
			<p>Also, NASA's Orion spacecraft being prepared for launch later this year on an uncrewed lunar mission will use lasers on future missions to send high-definition video of the moon back to Earth.</p>
			<p>The main goal for NASA's laser demonstration spacecraft is to determine how Earth's atmosphere, especially clouds, influences laser links to the surface, David Israel, NASA architect for exploration and space communications, said in an interview.</p>
			<p>The lasers will allow &quot;a whole day's worth of video or observation data to just be blasted down in one quick pass,&quot; Israel said.</p>
			<p>Israel worked on a new $310 million mission. Scheduled for launch this summer, the spacecraft consists of receivers and a laser transmitter and is no bigger than a king-sized mattress, according to NASA.</p>
			<p>Launch provider ULA postponed a June 23 target date to evaluate an issue with the rocket's engines and hasn't yet set a new date.</p>
			<p>The relay demonstration satellite will orbit the Earth for years, eventually testing the transmission of large amounts of data from the International Space Station to ground stations in Hawaii and New Mexico, Israel said.</p>
			<p>If clouds are too thick at the intended ground station, laser transmitters could be adjusted to find other receivers, he said.</p>
			<p>&quot;We have models and predictions, but we don't have much in the way of actual data to really characterize how bad the effects of weather will be,&quot; Israel said. &quot;We will measure the impact of weather so we can better predict good transmission conditions.&quot;</p>
			<p>The light beams of infrared lasers travel no faster than radio waves, but lasers can pack 10 to 100 times more data into a relatively quick beam. Such density would allow transmission of maps for the entire surface of Mars in about nine days, compared to nine months for radio waves, NASA said.</p>
			<p>Laser communications will aid a new era of spaceflight for private companies, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, said Debra Emmons, general manager of communications technologies and engineering at the non-profit, California-based Aerospace Corp., a think tank for the U.S. defense department.</p>
			<p>&quot;The ability to communicate and operate interchangeably between space assets will be critical ... as we set sights to the moon and beyond,&quot; Emmons said in an email.</p>
			<p>&quot;The sheer distances require laser-based communication -- not for speed, but for smaller size, weight, and power of optical terminal payloads compared to larger radio frequency [equipment].&quot;</p>
			<p>Laser communication is more secure than radio transmission due to the tighter, narrow beam of data, Emmons said.</p>
			<p>&quot;The chances of intercepting a laser beam are much smaller,&quot; she said. &quot;One has to be in the path of a laser beam to intercept any data, whereas radio waves scatter, and therefore can be intercepted more easily.&quot;</p>
			<p>The study of such lasers is expanding rapidly, Peter Delfyett, professor of physics, optics and photonics at the University of Central Florida, said in an interview.</p>
			<p>&quot;We're talking about massive amounts of information to be transmitted quickly, within a few seconds or minutes,&quot; Delfyett said.</p>
			<p>He compared laser communications to fiber-optics on the ground, without the use of fiber.</p>
			<p>Infrared lasers carry no significant risk to people in most circumstances and would not be visible unless someone was wearing infrared goggles, Delfyett said.</p>
			<p>The public may witness the improvements in communication, thanks to lasers, when NASA sends Artemis missions to the moon, NASA's Israel said.</p>
			<p>&quot;When that first flyby of the moon happens and high-definition video is streaming back, that'll be coming through an optical [laser] link,&quot; he said.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/10/echostar-faces-s-band-deadline/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Denver-based EchoStar is facing an ITU obligation on S-band implementation which has to commence by August 10th. Two nano-satellites, designed to operate in S-band and launched for EchoStar, have failed to reach orbit.</p>
			<p>The ITU obligation actually expired in April but an extension was made until August to permit EchoStar to launch and &lsquo;bring into use&rsquo; its S-band frequencies. However, a third nano-satellite also built by Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems for EchoStar, is being prepared for launch by the end of June.</p>
			<p>Irvine, California-based Tyvak, has enjoyed plenty of success in building small cubesats but suffered post-launch failures with its two EchoStar craft which had failures in changing their altitudes and orbital inclination after launch.</p>
			<p>Tyvak is reportedly using a different propulsion system on its third EchoStar craft.</p>
			<p>The ITU-granted licences for S-band give EchoStar global rights to the spectrum which is especially useful for Internet of Things customers and given that the rights extend to terrestrial as well as orbital usage makes it doubly valuable. And the prospects are immense. EchoStar bought Helios Wire back in October 2019 and the asset included Sirion Global. Sirion has global rights to 30 MHz of capacity and is said to be enough spectrum to handle at least 5 billion units which could range from low-cost home automation and security to &#150; it is claimed &#150; even 8K streaming video.<br>

			<p><b><i>Starz launches legal action against Disney&rsquo;s Star+ streamer in Latin America over naming<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/06/11/starz-launches-legal-action-against-disneys-star-streamer-in-latin-america-over-naming/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Disney is facing a legal challenge against its plans to roll out Star+ in Latin America in August.</p>
			<p>Star operates as an adult-oriented hub within Disney+ in a number of markets, but the company is set to launch it as a standalone service in Latin America on August 31. </p>
			<p>Putting that plan up in the air however is Starz, which has filed complaints in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. The flagship Lionsgate brand has argued that Starz Plus phonetically is too close to StarzPlay and that it will confuse customers. </p>
			<p>In its legal filing, the company states: &ldquo;Disney&rsquo;s decision to launch a standalone general entertainment streaming service under the name &lsquo;Star+&rsquo; and rename its existing channels to &lsquo;Star&rsquo; in Latin America &#150; despite the prior existence of and trademark registrations for Starz&rsquo;s own similarly named StarzPlay general entertainment streaming service &#151; is extremely likely to cause customer confusion in the Latin American marketplace and infringes on Starz&rsquo;s marks. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;Such customer confusion can be impossible to remedy and will likely only increase as Disney launches its marketing blitz in those regions.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Starz currently has a presence in 58 countries, with StarzPlay launching in Latin America in 2019</p>
			<p>Disney had initially planned to rollout Star+ in June, but that was delayed to late August during the company&rsquo;s most recent earnings call. The company is yet to comment on the legal action and it remains to be seen whether it will impact the planned launch on August 31.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Sky has entered the broadband market with an unlimited data 900Mbit/s UFB fibre plan at $79 per month. Video / Sky NZ</p>
			<p>Sky is offering a year's free Disney+ access to anyone who signs up for at least 12 months to its new broadband service.</p>
			<p>Following a recent price rise, the Disney+ streaming service costs $12.99 per month or $129.99 (a 15 per cent saving) if you pay for a year up-front.</p>
			<p>Sky Broadband offers an unlimited data 900Mbit/s UFB fibre plan for a very competitive (for that speed) $79 per month.</p>
			<p>The Disney+ offer will be available to any eligible customer who signs up to Sky Broadband before May 31, 2022, and is a new or returning Disney+ subscriber.</p>
			<p>All customers that have previously signed up to Sky Broadband will also be offered 12 months of free Disney+. That should get Sky some goodwill. 2degrees snubbed existing customers when it introduced a similar 12-month promotion involving Amazon's $8.99 per month Prime Video.</p>
			<p>The Disney+ deal is also exclusive to Sky Broadband; a contrast to Netflix that has run numerous promos with major ISPs.</p>
			<p>The deal also marks another shift in the relationship between Sky and Disney+.</p>
			<p>In late 2019, as it launched its new global streaming service, Disney pulled its channels from Sky TV and other pay-TV operators around the globe.</p>
			<p>But lately, they've been getting closer again with Sky customers getting access to the ESPN+ streaming service (ESPN is 80 per cent owned by Disney, 20 per cent by Hearst Communications); content from Disney-owned Hulu now appearing on Sky's Neon following Sky's purchase of Spark's Lightbox) and the new Disney+ promo.</p>
			<p>Direct-to-consumer apps - which cut out both old-school middlemen like Sky and new-school aggregators like Netflix - have been around for a while but have really taken off over the past 18 months, and accelerated during 2020.</p>
			<p>Disney has seen all of its big three streaming services, Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, pile on to hit a collective 142m subscribers worldwide and US$3.5 billion revenue by early this year.</p>
			<p>The runaway success of Disney+ has sparked a wave of direct-to-consumer imitators, including Discovery+, HBO Max and Paramount+.</p>
			<p>But like Netflix, Disney+ has seen its streaming growth slow in its latest quarter as Covid restrictions ease in many countries.</p>
			<p>Yet global streaming services are now far and away larger than any traditional broadcaster - and they're still getting bigger.</p>
			<p>Disney+ added &quot;only&quot; 8.7 million new subscribers during the March quarter for a new total of 103.6m subs worldwide (analysts had been expecting 110m).</p>
			<p>Elsewhere in the Disney empire, Hulu had 42m subscribers at the end of the March quarter, and ESPN+ 14m subs. While Hulu grew by a third over the past year and ESPN+ by 75 per cent, they also saw growth in the three months to March 31.</p>
			<p>Despite the levelling-off in growth, Disney says Disney+ is on track to reach between 230m and 260m subscribers by 2024.</p>
			<p>For contrast, Netflix recently reported 208m subscribers.</p>
			<p>Amazon has 204m subscribers to its Prime service, which includes goods delivery, audio and video, but doesn't break out video streaming numbers on a regular basis.</p>
			<p>Last month, Amazon said it would buy MGM Studios for US$9b ($12.5b) in a move that will boost content on its Prime Video service. Prime will also stream Amazon's billion-dollar Lord of the Rings series, currently being shot around West Auckland, and Amazon recently green-lit seven Prime original series that will be shot across the Tasman..</p>
			<p>Why Sky Broadband?</p>
			<p>Some analysts have questioned whether there's any point in Sky entering the crowded, low-margin broadband market. Others have seen potential for the new service to be used as a lever to keep customers loyal, or help attract new ones. Sky's first broadband offer certainly leans strongly in the reduce-churn direction. Your $79 broadband bill jumps to $109 per month if you drop Sky Starter.</p>
			<p>Another argument goes that the more services you have with one provider, the more hassle it becomes to defect to a competitor - hence the craze for power companies to bundle broadband. The advent of UFB fibre - whose simpler infrastructure means it's much easier for a customer to be shifted between retail internet providers - has underpinned the fad.</p>
			<p>Former Sky TV chief executive Martin Stewart favoured a major telecommunications play, with his company dealing directly with Chorus. He also said a Sky mobile phone service was &quot;only a matter of time&quot;.</p>
			<p>Under new CEO Sophie Moloney, the mobile ambition has been quietly shelved, and Vocus (owner of Orcon, Slingshot and Flip) has been brought in as a middle man - lowering costs and risk, if also eating into margin.</p>
			<p>Vocus operated the first iteration of the broadband service known as Stuff Fibre (later run by Vibe) when it first went live in 2016. Stuff Fibre garnered a modest 20,000 customers before being sold to Vocus in 2020.</p>
			<p>Sky refused to comment on the number of Sky Broadband subscribers so far.</p>
			<p>The company's shares closed yesterday at 16.9c. The stock is down 8.65 per cent for the year.<br>

			<p><b><i>HBL PSL content deals with TikTok, Facebook <br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/09/hbl-psl-content-deals-with-tiktok-facebook/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The HBL Pakistan Super League has entered into an partnership with short form video platform TikTok. During the Abu Dhabi-leg of the HBL PSL 6, TikTok users will get an opportunity to engage and generate content on the platform.</p>
			<p>The HBL PSL 6 resumes at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium on June 9th with a match between Islamabad United and Lahore Qalandars. This will be the 15th fixture of the ongoing edition and the tournament will conclude on June 24th. As part of this partnership, the HBL PSL will be working with TikTok to develop content for TikTok users along with promoting the contributions of the existing fan base that follows the league.</p>
			<p> Babar Hamid, the PCB Commercial Director and Head of HBL PSL, said: &ldquo;The PCB and the HBL Pakistan Super League have always endeavoured to explore partnerships and collaborations that can help engage with our fans all around the world. TikTok is one of the most popular platforms these days and it has taken the world by a storm which makes this partnership very exciting for us. Pakistan has a big TikTok following and majority of the followers are passionate about cricket. The popularity of the HBL PSL can be gauged by the overwhelming response that our HBL PSL 6 anthem Groove Mera received on TikTok. We look forward to the start of an exciting journey with TikTok with the start of the Abu Dhabi-leg on 9 June. Our entire staff along with the franchises and all stakeholders have worked really hard and I am sure the efforts will be rewarded with quality cricket action at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>HBL PSL has also recently announced an arrangement with Facebook to bring the live action to fans globally for the  remaining matches of the HBL PSL 6.</p>
			<p>Facebook Paid Online Events will help the Board monetise the matches by requiring fans to pay a nominal one-time sign-up fee to access the live broadcast. The broadcast can then be watched anytime.</p>
			<p>Policy Lead Pakistan for Facebook, Sehar Tariq, commented: &ldquo;We are excited to partner for HBL PSL this year. The league has gained popularity around the world. With support from PCB we have been able to connect HBL PSL&rsquo;s global fan base to view their matches around the world while also supporting PCB to build a new revenue stream and support their business. We hope that Paid Online Events will enhance the experience of the HBL PSL for all cricket lovers across the world.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>PCB Head of Broadcast Rights and Business Development, Shoaib Naveed, added: &ldquo;Providing fans ease of access and enhancing the viewership of Pakistan cricket globally is a main feature of our broadcast strategy and part of the PCB overall Digital Transformation aims. This partnership for the remaining matches of HBL PSL 6 with Facebook has provided us with a unique platform, and it&rsquo;s great to be partnering with the largest social media platform in the world.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The online events will be accessible globally except in the US, Canada, Caribbean, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Sub Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Maldives; where the PCB has existing rights agreements with international media partners. <br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/08/thaicom-bids-to-extend-satellite-franchise/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Thaicom has reportedly set up a subsidiary business in order to bid for satellite orbital slots which the government is likely to auction in July.</p>
			<p>Thaicom has asked for the auction to be delayed, citing the pandemic. However, Thailand&rsquo;s National Broadcasting &amp; Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) is unlikely to shift the date.</p>
			<p>Currently the bidding process is open. Potential bidders have been able to buy a &ldquo;bidding envelope&rdquo; since May 21st. The date for bids to close in June 20th.</p>
			<p>Already declared to have bought a bidding envelope is local entrant Mu Space. There are four slot packages up for auction.</p>
			<p>The first package consists of orbital positions 50.5&deg;E and 51&deg;E with a reserve price of 677 million baht; the second is 78.5&deg;E with a reserve price of 366.4 million; the third involves 119.5&deg;E and 120&deg;E at 393 million; and the last is for 126&deg;E and 142&deg;E for 364.6 million.</p>
			<p>Thaicom 4 operates in orbital slot 119.5&deg;East while Thaicom 6 is at 78.5&deg;East. If Thaicom fails to renew its concession then ownership of the two satellites will revert to the country&rsquo;s Digital Economy &amp; Society Ministry in September.<br>

				From https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/SpaceXs_night_time_launch_sends_SiriusXM_satellite_into_orbit_999.html<br>
			</p>
			<p>Elon Musk's SpaceX launched a communications satellite for SiriusXM early Sunday from Florida in the first such mission since one of the broadcast company's spacecraft failed after launch in December.</p>
			<p>The satellite, known as SXM-8, was lifted aboard a Falcon 9 rocket at 12:26 a.m. from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The launch, which occurred at the start of a nearly 2-hour window, was the company's 18th launch of the year.</p>
			<p>It carried the SXM-8 digital radio satellite into orbit for Sirius XM's 34 million subscribers, according to the company.</p>
			<p>A malfunction of the company's previous satellite, SXM-7, led to the total loss of the spacecraft after SpaceX successfully launched it. SiriusXM reported the malfunction in January, but said the loss, was was insured for $225 million, wouldn't affect its service because it has multiple satellites.</p>
			<p>But this time the launch was successful. Approximately 9 minutes after liftoff, the booster's first stage returned to Earth, landing on one of SpaceX's two drone ships, called &quot;Just Read The Instructions&quot; stationed out in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
			<p>&quot;We have touchdown of Falcon 9,&quot; said SpaceX's Jessie Anderson during the launch webcast. &quot;Today marks the 87th overall successful recovery of an orbital class rocket.&quot;</p>
			<p>On Thursday, a SpaceX launched from the Florida site. A different Falcon 9 blasted off from Pad 39A at the nearby Kennedy Space Center. Its payload was a gumdrop-shaped cargo capsule bound for the International Space Station that arrived at the orbiting laboratory on Saturday morning with 7,300 pounds of science gear and supplies.</p>
			<p>The rocket glowed orange as the rocket climbed through the cloud layers.</p>
			<p>Weather risks at that time included showers and cumulus clouds, according to a forecast from the Space Force. The second launch window was Monday</p>
			<p>Sirius XM service comes installed in new vehicles from every major automaker in the United States and is available in nearly half of the preowned vehicles for sale in the country, according to the company.</p>
			<p>Two more SpaceX flights are scheduled for this month, including upgraded GPS III satellite for the U.S. Space Force. This would be the first military payload to fly on a reused rocket.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/08/starlink-could-offer-smaller-antenna/<br>
			</p>
			<p>SpaceX&rsquo;s Starlink has submitted an application to the FCC for permission to test a smaller antenna for its broadband-by-satellite service.</p>
			<p>The application asks for a temporary licence to test 5 new user terminals (in California, Colorado, Texas, Utah and Washington State). These new designs will use the same uplink and downlink frequencies as a conventional dish being used by &lsquo;beta&rsquo; testers.</p>
			<p>The filing applications were made on May 28th.</p>
			<p>Key differences are that the new design is square and smaller. The consensus is that with the FCC having approved lower operating orbits for some of the Starlink fleet then it could be that smaller dishes would work just as well.</p>
			<p>However, the testing regime will want to measure and verify all the key parameters of the new concepts with the existing &lsquo;Pizza-sized&rsquo; dish and compare and contrast the various options.<br>

In its financial statement for the fourth quarter ended 31 January 2021, Astro said It will continue executing its transformation plan that encompasses launching its own streaming service for Millennials that combines its vernacular content and premium live sports. </p>
			<p>This move by the broadcasting company also comes shortly after Disney+ recently entered Malaysia with Astro as the official distributor. The country's streaming space is also competitive, with streaming companies such as Netflix, tonton, iQIYI and Viu vying for consumers' attention. </p>
			<p>Sooka's head of programming, Emarina Mohd Kamal, said sooka's main differentiator is its ability to deliver live sports streaming on mobile for fans, enabling them to get their sports fix anytime. Sooka's launch comes at a time where users today embrace a mobile-first lifestyle and as such are attuned to consuming content online, she added. According to Emarina, the shift in viewing trends had consumers rapidly embracing the new normal digital lifestyle, and great content has become a vital digital asset. The team is also working with creators and production houses to create originals targeted at Millennials. A+M has reached out to Astro for additional information.</p>
			<p>Aside from live sports programmes including the English Premier League, Formula 1 Championships, and Wimbledon Grand Slam, Astro's new streaming platform also features local Malay dramas and movies, as well as Chinese and Indian shows. They include Projek: Anchor SPM, Rindu Awak Separuh Nyawa, Jebat, Scammer, The Maid, Ahli Bapak-Bapak Club, and Curi-curi Cinta. There will also be sooka originals such as Hantu Bonceng 2.0, Hawa, and PHD Muzik.</p>
			<p>Separately, Astro said in its latest financial statement that it will continue to enhance local content by producing more premium Astro Originals, and seize opportunities for adjacencies in commerce, broadband, digital and OTT. During the fourth quarter ended 31 January this year, Astro reported a 10% revenue dip to about RM1,108.8 million compared to the same period last year and a 4% dip in gross profit to RM430 million.<br>

					From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/06/04/optus-sport-picks-up-rights-to-the-fifa-womens-world-cup-2023-in-australia/<br>
				</p>
				<p>Optus Sport has acquired the rights to the FIFA Women&rsquo;s World Cup 2023 in Australia.</p>
				<p>The broadcaster described the event, which will be co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, as &ldquo;one of the biggest sporting events in Australia since the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games&rdquo;.</p>
				<p>The 32-nation tournament will kick off on July 20, 2023.</p>
				<p>Optus will present all 64 games from the tournament live and on demand, along with preview and review shows. The operator said that it has more than 880,000 active subscribers.</p>
				<p>Optus CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin said: &ldquo;We are delighted to not only support the most exciting women&rsquo;s sporting event in the world, hosted right here on our home soil, but also to demonstrate our unwavering commitment to growing women&rsquo;s sport in this country. This is truly a unique opportunity for Australians to stand behind our world leading Matildas and enjoy every action-packed moment of the tournament.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Sarai Bareman, chief women&rsquo;s football officer, FIFA said: &ldquo;FIFA is excited to welcome Optus Sport as our official broadcaster of the FIFA Women&rsquo;s World Cup 2023&#153; for Australia. Optus has shown a strong commitment to broadcasting women&rsquo;s football and this deal will provide unprecedented coverage in Australia for the tournament, as well as bringing women&rsquo;s football to more fans and new audiences. We look forward to working with Optus to promote the FIFA Women&rsquo;s World Cup 2023 to accelerate the growth of the women&rsquo;s game in Australia in the lead up to 2023.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Interest in women&rsquo;s football internationally is gaining significant traction, and this is being reflected in improved broadcast deals. In the UK, the FA Women&rsquo;s Super League recently signed a three-year deal with Sky Sports and the BBC worth an estimated &pound;8 million per season.<br>

				<p>The Te Taumata full-immersion language course has been a &quot;roaring success&quot; at Whanga&#x0304;rei's Te Puna o Te Ma&#x0304;tauranga Marae. Exclusive northern language lessons are in full swing, with numerous descendants of the northern tribes looking to r</p>
				<p>A new M&#x0101;ori-owned streaming platform seeks to establish greater data and storytelling sovereignty for M&#x0101;ori film and television makers, but it needs more shows.</p>
				<p>M&#x0101;ori Now launched on Friday, with a catalogue starring lauded astronomer Rangi Matamua&#x200B;, celebrity chefs Karena and Kasey Bird&#x200B;, and tikanga expert Pou T&#x0113;mara&#x200B;.</p>
				<p>Kristin Ross&#x200B; (Ng&#x0101;ti Kahu&#x200B;, Ng&#x0101;ti Tara&#x200B;) and her husband H&#x014D;hepa Tuahine&#x200B; (Te Arawa&#x200B;, T&#x016B;hoe&#x200B;), who also made the Pipi M&#x0101; &#x200B;series and dolls, said they wanted to provide a space for more M&#x0101;ori storytellers to showcase shows made entirely in te reo.<br>
					Kristin Ross and H&#x014D;hepa Tuahine launched the M&#x0101;ori doll range Pipi M&#x0101;, and are behind the Pipi M&#x0101; cartoon.</p>
				<p>The new streaming platform was joining a crowded marketplace. It would be up against local websites, Neon, Play Stuff, TVNZ OnDemand, Three Now, and M&#x0101;ori Television. There were also the global competitors, such as Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime and Disney+.</p>
				<p>Ross said there was still a need for a streaming service focused on te reo and te ao M&#x0101;ori perspectives.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;First and foremost, we want to champion M&#x0101;ori-owned and controlled stories and content,&rdquo; she said. She hoped more storytellers would get in touch about sharing their work on the platform.<br>
					M&#x0101;ori Now is a free streaming platform, for content in te reo.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of television shows and films focused on M&#x0101;ori stories, likeness, names and motif. Often, the people making the shows aren&rsquo;t, in fact, M&#x0101;ori.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>She said audiences would be reassured that the stories being told on M&#x0101;ori Now were from an authentic M&#x0101;ori perspective.</p>
				<p>But the new streaming service would also be up against M&#x0101;ori Television. Ross said the publicly funded broadcaster&rsquo;s focus had become too broad, and opened a gap in the market for a service such as M&#x0101;ori Now.</p>
				<p>The content on M&#x0101;ori Now would only be in te reo, she said, with a focus on high quality storytelling and entertainment programming.</p>
				<p>With the website launched on Friday, Ross said they would be turning their attention to commissioning and hosting more M&#x0101;ori-made programming.</p>
				<p>She said it was important that discussions about hosting content followed tikanga. She hoped the M&#x0101;ori Now platform would offer a flexible space for storytellers, so they didn&rsquo;t need to sacrifice any principles or authenticity.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;We want to have a discussion, a w&#x0101;nanga and hui with storytellers about how we can uphold tikanga M&#x0101;ori,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;M&#x0101;ori should be able to protect their data and storytelling sovereignty, and their intellectual property. These are the conversations we want to happen with M&#x0101;ori Now.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>M&#x0101;oriNow.com launched as a free streaming service, but required viewers sign up for an account.<br>

					From https://www.lowyat.net/2021/241146/astro-euro2020-4k-hdr-dolby-atmos-support/<br>
				</p>
				<p>With just mere days away before the kick-off between Turkey and Italy takes place at Stadio Olimpico in Rome which will mark the beginning of UEFA Euro 2020, Astro has announced that its 4K UHD broadcast of the football championship will also be in HDR.</p>
				<p>Specifically, the HDR format that will be used in the broadcast is HLG and will be available for all of the tournament&rsquo;s 51 matches regardless on whether its during live matches or replays. As mentioned in our previous report, Astro has reserved channel 781 and 782 specifically for the 4K UHD broadcast of UEFA Euro 2020.</p>
				<p>Aside from that, Dolby Atmos support will also be made available for the event. However, subscribers will only be able to enjoy it starting from the quarter-final stage onwards and exclusively for live matches.</p>
				<p>It goes without saying that you need a 4K UHD TV that supports HLG and Dolby Atmos to enjoy these enhancements. Not to forget, the 4K UHD broadcast is only available through the 4K-capable Astro Ultra Box.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, Astro has also announced that Interactive Mode will be made available to Astro Sports Pack customers that are going to catch the UEFA Euro 2020 through the Astro GO app and website. The new mode will allow them to check out matches and player statistics as well as replay goals, chances, and other highlights during live matches.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/03/ses-vs-intelsat-trial-adjourned/<br>
			</p>
			<p>A hearing at the Intelsat Chapter 11 bankruptcy court adjourned the claim and related trial of the SES action against Intelsat over C-band payments until a date to be agreed in September or October.</p>
			<p>A very brief hearing in front of Judge Keith Phillips heard that the two parties had met and that a consent order would be placed before the court outlining the agreement to the new date when witnesses can attend the court in person.</p>
			<p>However, a co-counsel lawyer for SES, Orin Snyder (of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP), told the court that the SES claim for $420 million was the largest against Intelsat. &ldquo;However, when we win this claim it would be a pyrrhic victory if Intelsat had simply protected and moved its assets to other Intelsat entities.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Snyder told the court that the SES claim against Intelsat was &ldquo;overwhelmingly meritorious&rdquo; and that SES believed Intelsat was engaged in a &ldquo;shell game&rdquo; as regards its current and expected assets, and in particular the $5 billion which would flow from the FCC in respect to the C-band auction of spectrum.  Consequently, he wanted the court to be very aware that the SES claim was against all the Intelsat entities involved in the Chapter 11.<br>

			<p><b><i>C-band clearance on schedule<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/04/c-band-clearance-on-schedule/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Intelsat and SES, the two largest operators of C-band frequencies over the US, have completed Phase 1 of their clearance of spectrum by the important June 1st deadline. It means that the two, plus Eutelsat and Telesat of Canada, can qualify for the FCC&rsquo;s initial end-of-year pay-out of some $2 billion in so-called incentive payments.</p>
			<p>The Phase 1 frequencies (totalling 120 MHz) have to be ready for 5G reallocation by December 5th.</p>
			<p>The next stage, and one that would fully qualify for the FCC&rsquo;s final incentive payments of an overall $9.7 billion plus up to an overall $5.2 billion to cover the costs of the repurposing exercise (mostly related to installing thousands of dish filters) and the launching of new satellites, must wrap by December 5th 2023.  These Phase 2 frequencies total 180 MHz (and will be 160 MHz for reuse and a 20 MHz &lsquo;guard band&rsquo;.</p>
			<p>The then chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, outlining the clearance scheme and incentive payments plan in February 2020, summed up the aim, saying: &ldquo;I favour accelerated relocation payments because &#x2026; it is in the public interest to make available the C-band for 5G deployment as quickly as possible, as part of the national priority to promote American leadership in 5G.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Pai added: &ldquo;The purpose is to expedite of the clearing of the lower portion of the band for 5G. On the other hand, there will be those who will complain that $9.7 billion in accelerated relocation payments is too much. They agree such a payment is necessary, but they would prefer a smaller amount&#151;in the neighbourhood of $1 billion, for example. But that number would be far below the value to wireless companies of the accelerated clearing, and ultimately the value to American consumers of faster development of 5G. And it would not be enough to properly align the incentives of the satellite operators with our national interest of getting this C-band spectrum cleared quickly so it can be put to use for 5G.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The FCC auction of the spectrum generated a total of $81 billion. AT&amp;T, for example, paid the FCC $23.4 billion for 1621 licences for 5G.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/06/04/paramount-to-introduce-ad-supported-cheaper-tier/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Less than six months after launching, ViacomCBS&rsquo;s streaming service Paramount+ is introducing a cheaper ad-supported tier.</p>
			<p>The &lsquo;essential&rsquo; plan will cost US$5 per month &#150; half the price of the premium tier &#150; but will come with a number of key differences. </p>
			<p>Those differences largely lie along the lines of content. Along with the addition of advertising, the cheaper tier will not offer local news coverage and will have a more limited range of sports coverage. Subscribers of the essential tier will also not be able to download content for offline viewing.</p>
			<p>The US$5 plan is essentially a replacement for the US$6 plan which was carried over from CBS All Access. Legacy customers still have the choice to continue paying US$6 per month for the limited commercial programming offer.</p>
			<p>The announcement comes shortly after WarnerMedia introduced a US$9.99 per month ad-supported tier for its premium streaming service HBO Max. Peacock, the other relative newcomer in the world of US broadcaster VOD services, has strongly incorporated advertising into its platform, and offers three tiers ranging from free to US$9.99 per month.<br>

			</p>
			<p>DAZN has agreed a &lsquo;game-changing&rsquo; deal with Matchroom Boxing which will see the Eddie Hearn promotion end its relationship with Sky Sports. </p>
			<p>The deal, first reported on in April, will see the promoter sign on with DAZN for at least 16 Matchroom UK fights annually available exclusively to DAZN subscribers in the UK and Ireland.</p>
			<p>The partnership will kick off on July 31 with three consecutive weekends of the Matchroom Fight Camp series. This will be followed by a slate of summer and autumn fight programming which will be announced at a later date.</p>
			<p>DAZN promised that these will include European and World title match-ups, however these will not include Matchroom&rsquo;s two biggest stars Anthony Joshua or Dillian Whyte. Fights involving either of the two boxers will be separately negotiated in a la carte deals, as DTVE previously reported. </p>
			<p>This new deal also expands on plans between DAZN and Matchroom across the US, Italy and Spain, with more events set to take place in these countries.   </p>
			<p>DAZN Co-CEO James Rushton said: &ldquo;Game. Changed. This historic deal builds on the success and momentum of our long-term partnership with Matchroom around the world and solidifies DAZN at the forefront of the global sports streaming era. Together, we are committed to building the new home of boxing in the UK and Ireland while continuing to grow the global home of boxing in a way that matches today&rsquo;s evolving viewing habits and brings fans all over the world more of the most premium live action, more round-the-clock global storytelling, and more broadcast and content innovations &#150; only on DAZN.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Matchroom Boxing Chairman Eddie Hearn said: &ldquo;We have made the monumental decision to sign a historic 5-year deal with sports streaming giant DAZN. This means that our UK events will now be broadcast live on DAZN along with all Matchroom shows across the world. Pushing the boundaries is something we will always continue to do and we needed a partner that shared our vision for boxing, and who was also willing to make the investment to make those dreams a reality.&rdquo;<br>

			</p>
			<p>Spain&rsquo;s pubcaster RTVE is trying to invigorate a lobby group of European public TV stations to pressurise global streaming platforms to pay taxes in the countries where they operate.</p>
			<p>The president of RTVE, Jos&eacute; Manuel P&eacute;rez Tornero, will meet this week with his counterparts in Germany, France and Italy to agree to lobby through the European Commission for the streaming platforms &ldquo;to pay taxes and fees&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they pay their taxes,&rdquo;  asked P&eacute;rez Tornero referring to Netflix, Amazon and HBO, adding,&rdquo;we have to make our voice heard&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>The Spanish government is drafting new legislation to force the streaming platforms to pay a sales tax related to the level of their subscriptions.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, RTVE is now in process of developing its own multimedia platform to sell its content worldwide. &ldquo;This is a new window, and we have to exploit it,&rdquo; P&eacute;rez Tornero concluded.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2021/06/02/indonesian-pay-tv-market-set-for-growth-thanks-to-dth-and-iptv/<br>
			</p>
			<p>The Indonesian pay TV market is set to grow by more than US$130 million over the coming years.</p>
			<p>According to GlobalData, the market will experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5%, increasing from US$497 million in 2020 to US$633 million in 2025. </p>
			<p>The report notes that while cable TV subscriptions will decline at a CAGR of 19% between 2020 and 2025, those losses will be offset by considerable growth in DTH and IPTV subscriptions.</p>
			<p>Akash Jatwala, senior research analyst of Telecoms Market Data and Intelligence at GlobalData, said: &ldquo;DTH will be the leading pay-TV service platform in Indonesia, in terms of subscriptions during 2020-2025, and will go on to account for 58% of the total pay-TV subscriptions by the end of 2025. IPTV, on the other hand, will see its subscriptions grow at a faster CAGR of 12% over the forecast period, primarily driven by the improving fixed broadband infrastructure in the country and growing adoption of multi-play packages with integrated IPTV service.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Indovision will lead the Indonesia pay-TV services market, by subscription share through 2020-2025, led by its strong presence in the DTH segment while Telkom Indonesia will gain significant market share through the forecast period driven by huge subscription gains from its IPTV service segment.&rdquo;<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://spacenews.com/satellite-operators-meet-120-mhz-c-band-clearing-target/<br>
			</p>
			<p>TAMPA, Fla. &#151; Satellite operators have cleared a portion of C-band in a key step toward giving the spectrum to U.S. wireless companies in December.</p>
			<p>Work has now started on installing filters on ground antennas across the United States, so wireless operators can use the lower 120 MHz of C-band for 5G without interfering with satellite broadcast customers.</p>
			<p>Intelsat and SES, the satellite operators with the largest share of the 500 MHz C-band in the U.S., will get more than $2 billion from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) if they can hand over the 120 MHz swath of frequencies by Dec. 5. </p>
			<p>The companies will get billions more if they can fully vacate the lower 300 MHz slice of C-band that the FCC auctioned off by Dec. 5, 2023, by moving customers to the upper 200 MHz of the band.</p>
			<p>Intelsat confirmed it met its June 1 internal goal to move customers from the lower 120 MHz of C-band &#151; the most complex obstacle in the way of meeting the FCC&rsquo;s deadline this year &#151; when contacted by SpaceNews.</p>
			<p>More than 80 broadcast, cable, radio, religious and government customers were consolidated into a higher portion of the band. </p>
			<p>Those moves also required technical changes at cable head-ends and Earth stations on the ground, sometimes in coordination at shared sites with SES, which also met its self-imposed June 1 deadline.</p>
			<p>Intelsat plans to install around 3,000 filters across the country on antennas pointed to its satellites by early fall.</p>
			<p>The company also needs to complete telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&amp;C) work at its Brewster, Washington, teleport before the FCC&rsquo;s Dec. 5 Phase 1 deadline.<br>

			</p>
			<p>Germany says it is prepared to help its citizens living in rural areas to access better Internet services with subsidies. The government&rsquo;s Transport Ministry says it will subsidise the purchase of SpaceX&rsquo;s Starlink satellite dishes and similar providers of wireless Internet connections with grants to households worth &euro;500, business daily Handelsblatt reported.</p>
			<p>The &euro;500 on offer more or less matches the fee that Starlink wants from subscribers for its satellite reception/transmission equipment and dish.</p>
			<p>However, while Germany will help offset Starlink&rsquo;s equipment &#150; or that of rival schemes &#150; the subsidy will not extend to monthly subscription and usage fees.</p>
			<p>The decision came after Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer met SpaceX founder Elon Musk at the construction site of Tesla&rsquo;s first European factory near Berlin in mid-May, according to Handelsblatt.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/02/warner-bros-discovery-name-for-merged-company/<br>
			</p>
			<p>Multichannel programmer Discovery has revealed the new name of the proposed standalone global entertainment company that will emerge from the combination of WarnerMedia and Discovery assets as &lsquo;Warner Bros. Discovery&rsquo;.</p>
			<p>It suggests the Warner Bros. Discovery name will honour, celebrate and elevate the world&rsquo;s most-storied creative studio in the world with the high quality, global nonfiction storytelling heritage of Discovery.</p>
			<p>David Zaslav, President and CEO of Discovery and the future CEO of the proposed Warner Bros. Discovery combined company, unveiled the new name to WarnerMedia employees from the Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank, CA, where he said: &ldquo;Warner Bros. Discovery will aspire to be the most innovative, exciting and fun place to tell stories in the world &#150; that is what the company will be about.  We love the new company&rsquo;s name because it represents the combination of Warner Bros.&rsquo; fabled hundred year legacy of creative, authentic storytelling and taking bold risks to bring the most amazing stories to life, with Discovery&rsquo;s global brand that has always stood brightly for integrity, innovation and inspiration. There are so many wonderful, creative and journalistic cultures that will make up the Warner Bros. Discovery family. We believe it will be the best and most exciting place in the world to tell big, important and impactful stories across any genre &#150; and across any platform: film, television and streaming.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The initial wordmark for the proposed company includes the iconic line from The Maltese Falcon, &ldquo;the stuff that dreams are made of&rdquo;, an additional homage to the rich legacy of Warner Bros. and the focus of what the proposed company will be about.</p>
			<p>In May 2021, AT&amp;T and Discovery reached a definitive agreement to combine WarnerMedia&rsquo;s premium entertainment, sports and news assets with Discovery&rsquo;s leading nonfiction and international entertainment and sports businesses to create a single company.</p>
			<p>Warner Bros. Discovery will bring together the strongest leadership teams, content creators, and high-quality series and film libraries in the media business, while accelerating both companies&rsquo; plans for leading direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming services for global consumers. The new company will unite complementary and diverse content strengths with broad appeal &#151; WarnerMedia&rsquo;s robust studios and portfolio of iconic scripted entertainment, animation, news and sports with Discovery&rsquo;s global leadership in unscripted and international entertainment and sports.</p>
			<p>The &lsquo;pure play&rsquo; content company will own one of the deepest libraries in the world with nearly 200,000 hours of iconic programming and will bring together over 100 of the most cherished, popular and trusted brands in the world under one global portfolio, including: HBO, Warner Bros., Discovery, DC, CNN, WB Games, Turner Sports, Cartoon Network, HGTV, Food Network, TNT, TBS, Turner Classic Movies, Wizarding World, Adult Swim, Eurosport, Magnolia, TLC, Animal Planet, ID and many more.</p>
			<p>Warner Bros. Discovery will be able to increase investment and capabilities in original content and programming; create more opportunity for under-represented storytellers and independent creators; serve customers with innovative video experiences and points of engagement; and propel more investment in high-quality, family-friendly nonfiction content.<br>

			<p>A 1000 hectare block of land on the Kait&#x014D;rete Spit near Christchurch may become home to a new rocket launch site.</p>
			<p>The land has been bought by a joint venture between the government and two local r&#x016B;nanga, Te Taumutu Runanga and Warewa R&#x016B;nanga, called Project T&#x0101;whaki.</p>
			<p>The venture aims to develop aerospace research facilities, including a possible launch pad.</p>
			<p>It will also protect and rejuvenate the unique Kait&#x014D;rete ecosystem with fencing, limited farming activity, and the planting of 5000 native plants over two years.</p>
			<p>Kait&Aring;&#141;rete Spit, near Christchurch, could be developed into a space rocket launch site.</p>
			<p>The 1000 hectares were bought from farming company Wongan Hills with $16 million of Crown funding.</p>
			<p>The sale is part of an agreement with Wongan Hills related to an Environment Court case brought by Forest &amp; Bird. The case claimed the company destroyed a large area of rare and threatened native plant, called shrubby tororaro, on the spit.</p>
			<p>Research, science and innovation minister Megan Woods said the joint venture was focused on conservation management, investigating consents and technical feasibility for an aerospace research and launch site on the spit, and attracting aerospace investment in the project.<br>
				The 1000 hectares purchased for $16 million sit in the middle of the spit.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are all in agreement that any aerospace activity must be compatible with the protection of [the spit's] threatened plants, animals and ecosystems,&rdquo; she said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is about seeing what investment attraction we can bring here.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We are not talking about a very large built facility. It can be quite a small footprint on this land. But that allows us to unlock the potential.&rdquo;<br>
				Kait&#x014D;rete Spit's landscape is a unique ecosystem, home to many rare and threatened endemic wildlife.</p>
			<p>The two r&#x016B;nanga are represented in the joint venture by a new company called Kait&#x014D;rete Limited. Company director David Perenara-O&rsquo;Connell said the venture would hopefully provide funding for the rejuvenation of the spit&rsquo;s unique ecosystem.</p>
			<p>Kait&#x014D;rete Spit is home to rare and locally endemic plant, invertebrate and reptile species, with internationally recognised ecological value.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is the first time that the two r&#x016B;nanga have come together like this on a commercial venture that seeks to provide great benefits to the area that we both hold so deep in our hearts.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Revenue from a possible rocket launch site would be used to restore and rejuvenate the spit.</p>
			<p>He said the spit was a significant historical site.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Historically, Kait&#x014D;rete was our tribal State Highway One, a major highway and trade route for our ancestors.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It is our role and duty to make sure we honour this past &#150; those who have lived, travelled and fallen in this special area &#150; by protecting and restoring its values and reaffirming our relationship to this whenua for future generations.&rdquo;<br>
			</p>
			<p>The land will be on a three-year lease back to former owner Wongan Hills as part of the transition. The lease revenue will help fund early research and conservation work.</p>
			<p>He said the project was called Project T&#x0101;whaki after a demi-God in M&#x0101;ori mythology who climbed into the heavens.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We have chosen the name as it speaks to the heart of what all this is about.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In climbing to the heavens, T&#x0101;whaki sought the knowledge and understanding to guide and support a way of life on earth.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Kait&#x014D;rete Spit was considered as a possible launch site for RocketLab in 2015 due to the low number of planes or boats using the area and its easy access to Christchurch.</p>
			<p>However, Rocket Lab eventually settled on the Mahia Peninsula because the resource consent allowed more launches per year. The Kait&#x014D;rete site was given consent to launch only 12 rockets per year.</p>
			<p>The spit also has a history of aerospace research, as it was used by NASA for suborbital rocket launches in the 1960s.</p>
			<p>New Zealand&rsquo;s space economy was valued at $1.7 billion in the 2018/9 financial year, employing 12,000 people.</p>
			<p>Mark Rocket, chief executive of unmanned high-altitude solar aircraft company Kea Aerospace, said Christchurch was already a gateway to the Antarctic and would soon &ldquo;be a gateway to space&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Dawn Aerospace, which makes reusable rockets designed to carry small satellites into space, welcomed the proposed facility.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We look forward to hearing from Kait&#x014D;rete Limited and the government with details of their proposed services, facilities and offering,&rdquo; a spokeswoman said.<br>

			<p><b><i>China&rsquo;s Chang Zheng 3B launch of Fengyun 4B weather satellite delayed 24 hours<br>
					</i></b><br>
				From https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/06/chang-zheng-3b-fengyun-4b/<br>
			</p>
			<p>China will launch a new geostationary weather satellite on Thursday June 2 local time, following a 24 hour delay. The Fengyun 4B satellite was originally due to lift off from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre at 00:25 China Standard Time (16:25 UTC on Tuesday June 1), aboard a Chang Zheng 3B/G3 carrier rocket.</p>
			<p>Fengyun, meaning &ldquo;wind and cloud,&rdquo; is a series of meteorological satellites which provide China and the international community with data for terrestrial and space weather forecasting. The program includes both polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites, with the Fengyun 4B (FY-4B) satellite to be part of the geostationary element of the constellation. Fengyun satellites are operated by the National Satellite Meteorological Center, part of the China Meteorological Administration.</p>
			<p>The first two Fengyun spacecraft, FY-1A and 1B, were deployed by Chang Zheng 4A rockets in 1988 and 1990 respectively. These were developmental versions of the low Earth orbit satellite, with FY-1A failing a little over a month after launch due to attitude control issues, and FY-1B operating for its planned two-year period.</p>
			<p>The operational FY-1C and FY-1D satellites were launched by Chang Zheng 4B rockets in 1999 and 2002, with FY-1C later serving as the target for China&rsquo;s 2007 anti-satellite weapons test, having ceased operations in 2004.</p>
			<p>Alongside the FY-1 satellites, China developed their first generation of geostationary satellites, Fengyun 2. The first of these satellites was lost in a pre-launch accident in 1994, with the successful launch of Fengyun 2A taking place three years later aboard a Chang Zheng 3 rocket. Eight satellites were launched between 1997 and 2018, of which the last three remain in service.</p>
			<p>The Fengyun 3 and 4 satellites represent a second generation constellation, replacing the FY-1 and FY-2 series respectively. Fengyun 3 was introduced first, with FY-3A riding a Chang Zheng 4C to orbit in May 2008, with three more FY-3 spacecraft following it in 2010, 2013 and 2017.</p>
			<p>While FY-4A has since been retired, the rest of these satellites are still in service. The first new geostationary satellite &#150; FY-4A &#150; was deployed in December 2016 as a pathfinder for the second-generation spacecraft and remains in operation. The FY-4B satellite will be the first operational launch of the second-generation geostationary satellite.</p>
			<p>The Fengyun 4 satellites are being constructed by the Shanghai Institute of Spaceflight Technology, based around the SAST-5000 platform. Unlike the spin-stabilized Fengyun 2 series, Fengyun 4 employs three-axis stabilization to maintain orientation. Each satellite has a mass of approximately 5,300 kilograms (11,700 lb), and is designed to operate for at least five to seven years.</p>
			<p>The FY-4B satellite carries the same suite of four instruments as FY-4A, which will gather data to help forecasters studying weather systems on Earth as well as helping to study and predict space weather.</p>
			<p>Fengyun 4B&rsquo;s primary instrument, the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) provides a new capability over the Fengyun 2 series. This is a vertical sounding instrument with a Michelson interferometer, operating in visible-light, short to mid infrared, and longwave infrared channels. It is designed to measure temperature, humidity, and cloud cover and composition to build a three-dimensional map of atmospheric conditions. The GIIRS instrument aboard Fengyun 4B has been redesigned compared to the instrument on Fengyun 4A, providing increased resolution over the pathfinder satellite.</p>
			<p>The Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) is a successor to the S-VISSR spin-scan radiometer aboard the Fengyun 2 series. AGRI uses an off-axis telescope with two scan mirrors to image the Earth across fourteen spectral bands. These include three visible and near infrared bands, three shortwave infrared bands, two midwave infrared bands, two bands in the absorption spectrum of atmospheric water vapor, and four longwave infrared bands. Overall AGRI can image at wavelengths between 0.45 and 13.8 microns, with a peak resolution of 500 meters in the visible-light band.</p>
			<p>By producing images at different wavelengths, AGRI can highlight different features in the atmosphere or on the Earth&rsquo;s surface that might be relevant to forecasters. This includes aerosols, cloud and fog cover, vegetation, snow, fire, and water vapor in the atmosphere. Longwave infrared images can also be used to monitor the temperature of the ocean surface. AGRI takes about fifteen minutes to produce a full-disc image of the Earth and can also produce images of smaller regions with scan times between one and five minutes.</p>
			<p>The Lightning Mapping Imager (LMI) is a near-infrared CCD imaging system which will continuously monitor the Earth for lightning. With a resolution of up to 6.8 kilometers, LMI will record the number and intensity of lightning flashes between clouds and the ground, between different clouds, and within individual clouds. Depending on the time of year, LMI will be used to study storms over mainland China or over the Indian Ocean.</p>
			<p>The Space Environment Package (SEP) consists of a high energy particle detector, radiation dosimeter, fluxgate magnetometer, and a surface charging sensor. These will be used to help study the impacts of space weather with the Earth, including geomagnetic and heliophysics interactions.</p>
			<p>As well as gathering data with its own instruments, Fengyun 4B hosts a data collection system that will receive and relay data from remote ground research stations &#150; both in China and surrounding regions within the satellite&rsquo;s field of view.</p>
			<p>An image captured by the Fengyun-4A satellite in February 2017 &#150; via the Chinese Meteorological Administration</p>
			<p>China will use a Chang Zheng 3B/G3 rocket to carry Fengyun 4B into orbit. Also known as the Long March 3B/G3, this is a three-stage rocket that forms part of the legacy Chang Zheng family of vehicles originally derived from the Dongfeng 5 missile.</p>
			<p>This family, which includes several configurations of the Chang Zheng 2, 3 and 4 vehicles, currently accounts for most of China&rsquo;s orbital launches &#150; although in the long term they are expected to be supplanted by newer designs such as the Chang Zheng 5, 6, 7 and 8.</p>
			<p>The Chang Zheng 3 subfamily are specialized for launching geosynchronous satellites, incorporating a cryogenic upper stage. Development began in the late 1970s as a three-stage version of the existing Chang Zheng 2 vehicle, with the first Chang Zheng 3 rocket flying in January 1984 but failing due to a problem during third stage flight. The first successful launch was made a little over two months later. The stretched Chang Zheng 3A, which also featured a widened upper stage, made its debut in February 1994, doubling the rocket&rsquo;s payload to geostationary transfer orbit.</p>
			<p>In the 1990s, China had ambitions of winning a large share of the commercial satellite launch market. Even with its upgrades, the CZ-3A was not powerful enough to carry most of the contemporary geostationary satellites, so the Chang Zheng 3B was developed as well. This added four liquid-fueled boosters to the rocket&rsquo;s first stage, as well as a further stretch to the second stage of the vehicle.</p>
			<p>Chang Zheng 3B made its maiden flight in February 1996, however as soon as the rocket left the ground it was obvious that something was wrong. Before it had even cleared the tower, the CZ-3B pitched over. After flying horizontally, it pitched down with its engines still firing and struck the ground about 1.9 kilometers away from the launch pad.</p>
			<p>The impact site was close to Xichang&rsquo;s main gate. Official reports indicated that six people were killed and another 57 injured in an accommodation area close to the gate, however western reporters have estimated that the true death toll may have been much higher. The failure more or less ended China&rsquo;s aspirations in the commercial launch industry, as the US State Department refused to grant further export licenses for satellites with any American components to China, after concerns that US firms participating in the investigation into this failure, as well as a Chang Zheng 2E failure a few years beforehand, had contributed to China&rsquo;s development of more reliable missile systems.</p>
			<p>Long March 3B lofts a pair of BeiDou-3 navigation satellites in December 2019</p>
			<p>Chang Zheng 3B returned to flight in August 1997, making two flights that year and two in 1998 to fly out the remaining US-built satellites that had already been authorized to launch. The rocket would then not fly again until 2005 when it launched APStar-6, a Chinese-owned communications satellite build by European manufacturer Alcatal Alenia Space (now Thales Alenia Space) without any US-sourced components to avoid running afoul of the export ban. Further commercial launches, with Thales-manufactured satellites and an increasing number of Chinese-built spacecraft, followed.</p>
			<p>In recent years, the CZ-3B design has undergone a series of upgrades aimed at increasing its payload capacity. The first upgrade, CZ-3B/G2, was introduced in 2007 incorporating stretches to the first stage and boosters. Another version, CZ-3B/G3, made its debut in 2011 and has been primarily used for Chinese government launches.</p>
			<p>Two other versions have made small numbers of launches: the CZ-3B/G1 was used to launch two pairs of Beidou-2 navigation satellites in 2012, although subsequent Beidou launches have used G3 rockets with an additional YZ-1 third stage, while the CZ-3B/G5 was used for a launch to sun-synchronous orbit last year with the Gaofen 14 satellite.</p>
			<p>The final member of the Chang Zheng 3 series is the Chang Zheng 3C. This is a modification of the Chang Zheng 3B, with two boosters instead of four to optimize it for smaller payloads.</p>
			<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s launch is the seventy-fifth for the Chang Zheng 3B and the 132nd overall for the Chang Zheng 3 family. Of its previous seventy-four missions, the Chang Zheng 3B has completed seventy successfully, with two failures &#150; including the maiden flight &#150; and two partial failures which reached lower-than-planned orbits but where the payloads could be salvaged.</p>
			<p>The most recent failure &#150; a total loss &#150; occurred during last year&rsquo;s launch of the Palapa-N1 satellite. The cause of the failure has not been formally announced, however it has been indicated that the anomaly occurred during second and third stage separation, or at third stage ignition. Seven CZ-3B rockets have flown successfully since the failure.</p>
			<p>For Wednesday&rsquo;s launch of Fengyun 4B, the CZ-3B rocket will fly from Pad 2 of the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in China&rsquo;s Southwestern Sichuan Province.</p>
			<p>Xichang was first used for orbital launches in 1984, with the introduction of the Chang Zheng 3. The site&rsquo;s southern location compared to other launch sites at Jiuquan and Taiyuan makes it better suited to geostationary launches, where a satellite needs to end up orbiting over the equator.</p>
			<p>A jettisoned Long March 3B booster after landing downrange from Xichang</p>
			<p>The center&rsquo;s inland location, however, is not ideal for launching satellites as debris from the rocket &#150; including spent boosters and discarded payload fairings &#150; can fall into populated areas downrange of the launch site. Photos or videos of these falling onto or around houses and other buildings have not been uncommon following launches from Xichang.</p>
			<p>Launches from Xichang will slowly be phased out as China replaces the Chang Zheng 3 family with newer rockets. The Chang Zheng 5, 7 and 8 rockets, which are expected to take over geostationary missions, fly from the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center on Hainan Island. This site is coastal &#150; meaning debris will fall into the sea instead of on land &#150; and closer to the equator than Xichang.</p>
			<p>Xichang has two launch pads for large orbital rockets, which can be used by Chang Zheng 2, 3 or 4 rockets. Pad 3 was originally built for the Chang Zheng 3, and was later used by CZ-2C vehicles. Between 2005 and 2007 this complex was completely rebuilt for the Chang Zheng 3A, with further upgrades made around 2014 allowing it to host CZ-3B and 3C launches. A small number of Chang Zheng 2C rockets, and a single Chang Zheng 4C, have flown from the pad since refurbishment.</p>
			<p>Pad 2, which will be used for the Fengyun 4B launch, was built in the late 1980s. It was initially used by the Chang Zheng 2E rocket, a modified version of the Chang Zheng 2D with boosters and a solid-fuel upper stage which was designed to fly commercial missions prior to the introduction of the Chang Zheng 3B. At their introduction, the Chang Zheng 3A, 3B and C3 flew exclusively from Pad 2, with the former moving to Pad 3 following its 2007 rebuild. Since the most recent upgrades to Pad 3, all three configurations can fly from either pad.</p>
			<p>Because of its heritage as a descendent of the Dongfeng 5 missile, Chang Zheng 3B&rsquo;s first and second stages are fueled by hypergolic propellants: unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and dinitrogen tetroxide. The first stage is powered by a YF-21C powerplant, consisting of four individual YF-20C engines built into a single module. Each of the four boosters clustered around the first stage has a single YF-25 engine, a derivative of the YF-20 which burns the same propellant mixture.</p>
			<p>Chang Zheng 3B/G3&rsquo;s second stage is powered by a YF-24E unit, consisting of a YF-22 main engine &#150; a YF-20 variant optimized for high-altitude operation &#150; and a YF-23 vernier engine with four combustion chambers that can be gimballed to provide attitude control. The rocket&rsquo;s third stage burns liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen in its twin YF-75 engines.</p>
			<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s launch will deliver Fengyun 4B into a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), an intermediate elliptical trajectory from which the satellite will maneuver itself into its final geostationary orbit.</p>
			<p>The Fengyun launch is China&rsquo;s sixteenth mission of 2021 and the third for the Chang Zheng 3B. China has several further launches scheduled later in June, including the Shenzhou 12 mission which will carry the first crew to China&rsquo;s new space station. The next launch from Xichang is likely to be a Chang Zheng 2C flight, also targeting the middle of the month.<br>

					</i></b><br>
				From https://advanced-television.com/2021/06/01/oneweb-adds-36-to-leo-fleet/<br>
			</p>
			<p>A Russian Soyuz 2.1b rocket safely delivered 36 OneWeb broadband satellites into orbit on Friday evening, May 28th.</p>
			<p>The launch was managed by Arianespace. &ldquo;The launch went according to plan,&rdquo; Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the Roscosmos space agency, said on messaging app Telegram. They were orbited from Russia&rsquo;s Vostochny launch site.</p>
			<p>While the launch was of 36 satellites, the craft are freed from the rocket in four distinct batches over a four-hour period. The satellites will eventually operate from 1,200 kms.</p>
			<p>This was the seventh launch for OneWeb and takes the overall total of satellites in orbit to 218 craft. OneWeb needs  648 satellites to form a complete global system, although initial services will commence later in 2021 to the northern hemisphere and regions north of 50 degrees latitude.</p>
			<p>However, to begin that limited service, OneWeb needs another batch of 36 to be launched.<br>

			</p>
			<p>China is forming a dedicated business to create and manage a massive fleet of 13,000 Low Earth orbiting (LEO) satellites.</p>
			<p>The system is designed to compete &#150; at least locally &#150; with Elon Musk&rsquo;s Starlink global system. The creation of the new business seems to suggest that Musk will find it impossible to openly seek subscribers in China.</p>
			<p>The news of the new business emerged in a brief press release from the Chinese state-owned Assets Supervision &amp; Administration Commission (SASAC) and says that a new company, China Satellite Network Group Co. Ltd., will be &ldquo;performing the duties of funder and included in the list of enterprises that perform the duties of funder by SASAC&rdquo;.</p>
